We're here today seeking a million dollars for a six percent stake in our company. Everyone knows electric vehicles are the future; they're better for the environment and soon they'll be everywhere. But there's one major thing keeping them from growing faster: range anxiety. Range anxiety is the fear of running out of charge in your electric vehicle. That's why I would love to introduce you to the Roadie, the world's first and only portable modular and ultra-fast EV charger. The anxiety of finding a charging station and the time wasted waiting for a vehicle to charge simply goes away when the charging station comes to you, no matter where you are. The Roadie has three core features: number one, modularity; units can be connected together to give the electric vehicle owner the exact amount of range they want. Number two, portable; our portable units can charge an electric vehicle anytime and anywhere, making any location a charging station. And of course, the most important factor: speed. We can charge an electric vehicle at a rate of one mile every 60 seconds. So Sharks, help us create a more sustainable mobile EV charging infrastructure."

Sharks, in my 20 years in the U.S. Army flying helicopters, I was able to get a bird's eye view of the world's plastic crisis. I was shocked by the way other countries were disposing of plastic. Sharks, the plastic crisis spans across our cities, landfills, and our oceans and surprisingly one of the biggest culprits is the laundry industry. And so we decided to take matters into our own hands and we started Sheets Laundry Club to combat the plastic crisis. We did that by developing a patented eco-friendly dehydrated sheet of laundry detergent. It's lightweight, it's mess-free, it's easy to use, and best of all, it's 100% plastic-free from start to finish. You very simply take one sheet of detergent and you toss it in with your dirty laundry. At the end of a wash cycle, it leaves your laundry soft, fresh, and clean every time. It's more convenient than liquids and powders, it's more cost-effective to ship, and it is far better for our planet than mainstream alternatives. Sharks, it's obvious we care about the planet, so which one of you wants to get hooked on creating a plastic-free tomorrow?"

Ornament Anchor keeps your memory safe and secure. This is an ornament that Ayan made when he was two years old, I'd be really upset if it broke. To secure it, I simply take Ornament Anchor and I put it through the hole, then I pull it up and over, I find a branch, put it on and pull. That's it! With Ornament Anchor, you'll never have to worry about another precious memory being broken on the floor. Ornament Anchor can hold up to 10 pounds so you feel confident your ornaments are secure and you'll never have to worry about pets knocking off your ornaments again.

Sharks, imagine an everyday product that fails seven times per second in the U.S. alone and generates $50 billion worth of toxic waste every year. Now imagine that same product was first patented back in 1847 or 1848 — that's so old that the light bulb hadn't even been invented yet. We've put a man on the moon and robots on Mars, yet this one product hasn't changed much in over a century. Do you know what it is? That's right — the everyday rubber tire, filled with air and steel, that still goes flat. And that's why we started The Smart Tire Company — the world's first high-performance, airless tire made from space-age material that uses proprietary technology originally invented by NASA. We use an advanced material called Nitinol — a shape-memory alloy that's as elastic as rubber yet as strong as titanium. SMART — short for Shape Memory Alloy Radial Technology — will revolutionize how vehicles perform both on-road and off-road. Smart Tires make transportation safer, are better for the environment, and are made here in the USA. So, Sharks, we're seeking $500,000 for 2.5% equity. Who wants to join us in reimagining and rebuilding the next great American tire company — The Smart Tire Company?"

In elementary school, everyone looks forward to playing outside during recess, me too, until on the playground I was bullied for something I couldn't control and hated my bushy thick unruly eyebrows. The torture of my peers was exhausting until I finally decided to make my haters my motivators and embrace my beautiful brows. I searched for brow products but nothing worked for me, so what did I do? I decided to make my own. Introducing Tania Speaks Organic Skincare, a powerful plant-based brow gel that tames thick brows and grows thin brows. It's organic, lightweight, contains no harsh chemicals, and actually works for brow growth and styling. And it's not just our brow gel thriving; we created other products like our foaming cleanser, resurfacing toner, facial moisturizer, and for the guys, the organic beard oil.

Here's the proof.I travel all over the world collecting spoons and inspiration, and I create custom collections based on my experiences. Through my social media, I do one product drop a month — and guess what? They sell out within minutes. My drops create online frenzies — and I mean literal frenzies where people camp out in work bathrooms fighting inch by inch just to get one before they sell out. Crazy, right? One day I woke up and I was the freakin' ring king. That's because I harnessed the power of branding, social media, and the unique Gen Z world to build a brand out of myself. Sharks, I'm such a branding genius that I even made a ring out of a spoon that was in Mr. Wonderful's mouth — turning it into a piece of art any of you would love.

Kettlebells have become increasingly popular and provide dynamic full body workouts that build functional strength and range of motion. However, kettlebells are expensive, nearly impossible to travel with, and take up valuable floor space. So I began thinking of a way to turn the dumbbells that I already owned into kettlebells, and that's when the light bulb went up. I made a rough sketch and I sent it to my best friend Nancy. He was impressed by my talent as an artist; it looked like it was drawn by a five-year-old, but I could tell what it was supposed to be and I loved the concept. Kettle grip is a portable dumbbell adapter that allows you to do all of your favorite kettlebell exercises anywhere you can find a dumbbell. Simply open the kettle grip, insert any dumbbell, secure the latch, and you're ready for your Kettle grip workout. Clever Kettle grip is great for swings, upright rows, overhead presses, flexibility, and range of motion. We are seeking a $300,000 investment for 10% equity in our company.

So Sharks, I grew up in a big Greek family and I always felt supported but I developed a problem actually two big problems. I developed large breasts at a young age and they just destroyed my back and my neck and my shoulders. I used to have to wear not one, not two, three sports bras just to play soccer like and keep the girls in place without losing an eye. And I am not alone, there are 50 million women today in the United States with large breasts struggling to find support and comfortable options. That's why I developed patent-pending stays technology that you can only find on a Behave bra because I know from personal experience large breasts need a lot more than just lift. Let me show you how it works. So stays are stretchy pieces of fabric and they live in the cup of every Behave bra. They encapsulate each breast and ensure that both of the girls are staying in their assigned seats. They're kind of like a soft seat belt but for your bust and stays are so secure that they keep you supported even if you go sideways. So stays get rid of boob smash, boob jiggle, and boob sweat and they are a huge reason my customers tell me Behave bras is not just the most supportive thing in the bra drawer but it's also the most beautiful. So you guys have Behave bras in front of you and I really am super excited to show you the product."

It contains an extremely healthy, sustainable form of protein that we like to refer to as our secret ingredient. Hello, Chapul. This is Pat speaking. We're growing every month and we can't keep up with demand. We need an investment from the Sharks to increase our production and get the word out about our amazing product. Yeah, stoked on the new design. It looks good. Starting to pool has been a challenge. People have called us crazy and said that the idea would never work.

My company is Chapul and I'm asking $50,000 in exchange for 5% equity of our company. At Chapul, we're changing the way people think about food, and we do it with an energy bar.

No, it's our sustainable, eco-friendly form of protein that goes into every single bar. I'll show you, but first, a joke. Why are frogs so happy? Why? Why? Because they eat what bugs them. And now so can you with Chipool Cricket bars? Oh, you got to be kidding. Crickets are an extremely sustainable form of protein. They go into each one of our bars. Oh, insects are eaten in over half the countries around the globe. And we think it's about time that Americans catch up with the rest of the world. There is no way I'm eating that. All right. We have a Thailand themed coconut ginger lime. This one? Yep. Aztec bar is dark chocolate coffee cayenne. And then we have an all American peanut butter and chocolate. Why not? Right. They're crickets, not cockroaches. Correct. We actually make a flower out of the crickets, so you won't see any legs or antennas. You first. Must we eat it? Sure.

While our relationship with dogs has completely modernized, most dog products are still clunky, inconvenient, or something even your dog would be embarrassed by. The most important thing that your dog needs besides pets and cuddles is water. But who here has tried the 'make your hand into a bowl' method? It's messy, wastes water, and doesn't work well. Or you can pour the contents of your water bottle into a portable bowl, and when your dog doesn't drink at all, you're left having to throw it out. And public water bowls can infect your pup with creepy bacteria, and let's be honest, we know you kiss that mouth daily. So we invented the Springer travel bottle, the best way to give your dog water anywhere at any time. Can you simply squeeze the bottle, the bowl will fill up with water, when your dog is done drinking, release the bottle and the water goes back into the bottle. No mess, no fuss, and no wasting water. This is just the first of many innovative products in the pipeline that solve problems pet owners face every day.

Just hook the Turbo Trusser right into place, closing up the cavity and sealing all the juices to cook a perfect bird. Check out these incredible results, Sharks! You'll get a delicious juicy chicken or turkey every time. This product is so universal you can use it in ovens, grills, smokers, roasters, rotisseries, deep fryers, and even air fryers. And best of all, it's made of food-grade stainless steel and it's dishwasher safe, and it's made right here in the good old USA.

Students are given boxes, tape, bubble wrap, and labels on campus if we prefer final exams. They pack up their belongings, lock up their room, and go home. We have a partnership with their university to unlock that room once the campus is empty and will move everything into storage for the summer. We'll even have all their belongings ready and waiting in their new room when they return to campus the following semester. So Sam, who does all this moving? That's the best part.

Sharks, as moms, we love to take our kids out into the world with us, but having little ones and diapers presents a decades-old problem: public diaper changing tables are disgusting. A few years ago, my son had the dreaded diaper blowout and there was no place to change his diaper but on this rock-hard plastic, just gross changing table. So gross! And there was no place to put my diaper bag but on the dirty restroom floor. Not the floor! I tried to keep bending down to get the diapers and then the wipes and then the change of clothes, but there was nowhere to put them on the surface and the safety strap was broken and my purse kept falling off my shoulder. I dropped my pacifier and all I kept thinking was how could I put my precious cargo down on something so filthy? It's so dirty! I know who knows what germs were festering? When was it last sanitized? Forget this! I set out loud, I can make a better one. Introducing PL, the world's first and only self-sanitizing diaper changing table for public restrooms. Every time you close the table, PL's patented UVC light system gets to work to protect babies. PL's UVC light sanitizes the entire surface, eliminating 99.9% of harmful bacteria and viruses, all within 60 seconds. PL's multi-purpose handles keep your diaper bag off the restroom floor and your hands free to change your child or catch that rogue pacifier before it hits the ground. So Sharks, who's ready to reimagine the public diaper changing experience and protect our most vulnerable? Join us and together we can change the table."

I'm here today seeking two hundred thousand dollars for 10% equity in my world-saving product. Sharks, you must have some primal desires we can't always control very well. One of those primal desires is the desire to build fires, specifically campfires. Now we all love a good campfire, but the devastation created by human-caused wildfires is heartbreaking, oftentimes totally preventable. So I set out to create something that would be clean, easy to use, and would keep us safe, something we can drink a beer around or, why Mr. Wonderful, and tell a great story. That's why I created Lava Box. Now normally we would never light Lava Box indoors, this is Shark Tank, let's fire this baby up! (laughs) So Lava Box is deceptively simple. It starts with a military-style ammo can. You just pop the top, check the propane, light the lighter that we provide, and then slowly turn on the gas. You guys ready? All right, here we go! There it is, pretty cool! So it can go from Kumbaya all the way to heavy metal fire. All right, let's turn it down. So about a foot out of the box is actually the perfect level for roasting marshmallows for s'mores. This is also what everybody asks me, 'Josh, can you cook on it?' And the answer is a resounding, 'You betcha!' So you can lift the Lava Box up to pass fire restrictions or close up the legs, pop it on top, and now you're ready for tailgating burgers at the same time. That's cool, Sharks! I think I've created the perfect grab-and-go solution for a very modern problem. So the question is, who's going to gather on the Lava Box and get lit with me, baby?"

And because of this, from age 5 years old on, everybody knew him as FID, which is short for Fiddler. My grandpa always told me the most important thing in life was to love everything I do, and I've really based my life on that advice. Gramps passed away a few years ago, and his death was hard for the whole family. Receiving his remains after the cremation didn't make it any easier. Sharks, this is how 1.9 million Americans every year receive the remains of their loved ones following cremation. This zip-tied plastic bag is how I received Gramps, and that experience was awkward and uncomfortable. Every year, millions of Americans have poor experiences with ashes and urns just like I did, and to avoid them, they're hiding one of their most treasured possessions in basements and closets and garages. So my company, Parting Stone, invented a new form of human and animal remains following the cremation. Parting Stone service returns the remains in a form that resembles a collection of smooth stones. The appearance of each collection of stones varies naturally from person to person, returning different hues and textures and colors for each individual. Now families tell us about how they were able to hold their loved ones again, share the remains with their community, and spread the stones in meaningful places. Solidified remains are giving families a comforting way to remember their loved ones every single day. Sharks, I'm here today seeking $400,000 for 5% of my company. I believe that our past loved ones deserve better, and your investment can bring a new opportunity to the millions of Americans who are struggling through loss."

One go-to option is the head wrap, but traditional head wraps can be made from harsh fabrics like cotton or polyester that can damage the hair, and learning how to tie them can be time-consuming and confusing. That's why I created the first-ever satin-lined easy tie head wraps. Yugo Natural wraps are not only super stylish and super easy to use, they're designed to protect and promote the health of your hair with super soft satin lining that reduces friction and retains the moisture in your hair. Our core line features cool turbans from lots of styles for both women and men, so you can look good on the go no matter what kind of hair you have. And that's not all! Our latest invention, the swim turban, is made with silicone lining so anyone can enjoy the water without worrying about the harsh effects of salt water and chlorine on your hair. Today, we built a massive customer base directly online, but we're here to make Yugo Natural a household name. So, Sharks, which one of you is ready to wrap this deal up?"

Did you use soap? What are you, my mom? Of course I did! We all know these are questions parents have to ask multiple times a day. Let's face it, kids don't like stopping what they're doing to wash their hands and when they do, they don't wash properly or for the right amount of time. Plus, kids love drawing on everything: tables, walls, and even on their own bodies. We put these two problems together and created a solution: Soapen, a colorful soap-filled pen that kids can draw with. With Soapen, kids can draw their germs away. Kids draw fun designs all over their hands, just like the shark Aman is making right now. Then they rub their hands together and rinse off, just like normal. Soapen's gentle, vibrant, and stain-free formula was designed to make kids thoroughly wash their hands for 20 to 40 seconds to get all that colorful soap off, creating healthier kids and happier parents. Regardless of a pandemic, hand washing with soap is a golden rule of prevention; it can save one out of three children from catching the most deadly diseases globally.

        "Full_Pitch": "Hi Sharks, my name is Bing Howenstein and I'm the CEO of All33. I'm here today to ask for $500,000 for a 2.5% piece of our company. Bing, baby, I know it is a very serious ask but that's because it is for a very serious problem: chairs. They may be killing you. Now you've all heard 'sitting is the new smoking.' Well, they are right. Sitting for any length of period of time is really bad for you, and chairs, well, they've had the same basic design for almost 3,000 years. Whatever you're sitting in, even the fancy expensive chairs you guys are sitting in right now, you can find yourself locked, stuck, immobile, and a lot of times in pain. And for all of us working at home these days, this is just not okay. Well, I have some really good news for you: All33 is here to save the day! But don't just take it from me; let's hear what one of our biggest fans has to say. Hey Sharks, I'm Justin Bieber and this is the All33. It's the chair that moves like I do! I mean, guys, look at this perfect posture! Got my chest up, my shoulders back. I might be funny. I mean, have you guys ever seen a chair that can do this? I'm doing a full ab workout right now! All right, hit me up later; I'll be back. If you gotta sit, this is it. Now, Justin knows what he's talking about because this is our patented Sit in Motion technology. It's like a chair within a chair, and it rocks just like our sails. Now you don't have to have moves like Justin in order for this chair to work for you because all you have to do is sit, get fit, and all 33 of your vertebrae, well, they're going to keep moving all day."

        "Full_Pitch": "Hi Sharks, I'm Fran Harris from Dallas Texas and I'm seeking $350,000 in exchange for 20% of my company. Sharks, the sports drink category is a 23 billion opportunity. The problem is that a lot of these companies who are reporting to have functional hydration are actually putting water in bottles that are full of nothing more than sugar, artificial colors and ingredients, and you guessed it, salt. Sharks, consumers are not going to settle for a sports drink that overpromises and under delivers, leaving you feeling tired and sluggish. Do you know why? You know why? Because there's a new sports drink in town and she's got game! Introducing Electra, a better-for-you functional beverage hydration company that's going to change the sports drink game forever. Sharks, I played on an undefeated Division One Women's Basketball team at the University of Texas. I also played on the WNBA's first championship team with the Houston Comets, so safe to say I've consumed a lot of hydration and sports drinks. I can tell you without a doubt that everyday athletes, hustlers, and doers, what they're looking for, and Electra delivers on every single one of those. And yeah, there's some competition out there, but let me tell you, sharks, we are coming for that ass! So there's really only one question remaining: who's ready to Electrify their hustle and the tyranny of the sugary sports drinks and help me raise this billion doll baby?"
