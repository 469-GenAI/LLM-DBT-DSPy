There is sugar in everything and sugar is sneaky. It hides in the most innocent looking places like juice. Most juices on the market have upwards of 25 g of sugar. If you were to give your kid an 8 oz glass of juice every day for a year, you would be giving them 20 lb of sugar. Don't do it! Oh Phoenix, you are sugarcoated my friend. I knew I had to give him something better and that's why I created Kids Love. Okay Phoenix, get into position. Kids Love has this much sugar? Yeah, gotcha! Kids Love has no sugar, but you know what it does have? Vitamins and minerals, all 12 essential ones. I've created the first zero sugar functional drink for kids that has certified vegan vitamins and hydration. Kids love it and parents do too! So who wants to help me spread the love? Let's try it!

She looks absolutely stunning, crushing her commute, tearing up the dance floor, and looking her absolute best… for exactly 45 minutes. Then suddenly, her feet are on fire, and she regrets everything about her shoe choice.So, I invented the ultimate solution to high-heel pain and discomfort — the world's first fully convertible high heels.

With a quick twist of the wrist, our stylish high heels transform into comfortable, practical flats — just like that. Want to see me do it again? Impressive, right? It's so much more comfortable. Here at Passion, we're determined to make traditional high heels — and all the ridiculous problems that come with them — a thing of the past.

I bet you have. And if you're like most people, you do what we call the sniff test — woo wee! The average reusable water bottle contains more bacterial colonies than your dog's bowl or even a toilet seat. No wonder they stink. And it's no surprise that it's so tempting to reach for a single-use plastic water bottle instead. The result? More than one million of these guys are consumed every minute, which is bad for your health and even worse for the environment. That's why we invented the LARQ Bottle — the world's first self-cleaning water bottle that purifies water on the go. With a simple press of a button and just 60 seconds, the LARQ Bottle activates our patented UVC LED technology, eliminating up to 99.99% of harmful, odor-causing bacteria, viruses, and mold. The result? Pure water from an immaculately clean bottle. So Sharks, just to be clear — you heard me right: $500,000 for 1%. That's correct.”"

Sharks, I love to cook and tongs are one of the best tools that I have in the kitchen. But you know what sucks? It seems I never have enough when I'm cooking or serving food. You might say just buy more tongs, come on, nobody wants to do that. Look at these things, they're large, they're clunky, they take up space and every time you need them, they're buried in a sink full of dirty dishes. And that's why I invented Any Tongs. It's a simple compact tool that transforms ordinary utensils into versatile kitchen tongs. Check out how they work! You just grab any combination of forks or spoons, insert the handles into the rubberized slot, give it a firm tug, and instant tongs! When you're working with multiple dishes, you don't have to worry about cross-contaminating food. You just attach and reload with clean ones. That's pretty cool! And when you're done, just pop them out and toss them in the wash. You got two spoons, boom! Now you got tongs. How about forks? Boom! Any tongs, any time! So who's ready to assemble some tongs and grab a piece of this company?"

In Chihuahua, Mexico, there's an indigenous community called the Tarahumara who run up to 100 miles in a single day up in the mountains with these sandals made out of tires. So how do they have the endurance to do that? They consume this superfood called Pinole. It is a roasted and ground corn mixture that's been used to fuel this tribe of incredible long-distance runners. Growing up, I wondered why this amazing superfood didn't exist here, so I decided to bring back this ancient Mesoamerican tradition to the United States myself while donating back directly to the Tarahumara community. Pinole Blue is a line of products made from 100% USDA organic heirloom blue corn sourced from Mexico and stone ground with an ancient method using volcanic rock. This blue corn is rich in antioxidants, complex carbs, and has more protein than other corn varieties, and we use it in our drink mix, cookies, and even our stone ground tortilla that would make your mouth water. So Sharks, who's ready to get on the grind with Pinole Blue?"

Today, I'm seeking a $100,000 investment in exchange for 10% equity in the Scrub Daddy business. It's the greatest kitchen scrubbing tool you'll ever use because it changes its texture simply by adjusting your water temperature. Let me show you how it works. Here I have some hot water, and here I have cold water. When I dip the Scrub Daddy into the hot and cold water, a complete transformation takes place. Now, to show you, I have 10-pound weights here. Under the 10 pounds, it's soft and compressible — just like a sponge. That's for your gentle scrubbing applications. But here, look — it's hard and firm. That's for heavy-duty scrubbing. We've burned brown sauce, tomato sauce, cheese, and mustard onto a glass stovetop and a stainless steel pan. I'm going to wet the scrubber, and you'll see it attack that burnt-on mess right away — just scrubbing it off instantly. And remember, I'm only using water here. No chemicals, and it cuts right through it. It won't scratch any of your surfaces, but it'll make them perfectly clean. Now, Scrub Daddy isn't just smiling for fun — when you put your hand inside, you can clean the top and sides in one motion. And that smiling mouth? It cleans spoons, knives, forks, spatulas, even big serving spoons — on both sides at the same time. Sharks, with your help, Scrub Daddy will scrub and smile in every kitchen in the world.”"

Brightwheel is the mobile app for preschools, daycares, and families and we are completely revolutionizing early education. Now I believe all of us are parents here and I want to ask when you come home after a long day and you ask your kids what did you learn in school today, does it sound familiar? This is the experience for millions of parents across America every single day and especially for younger kids. You've been apart from your little human being for six, eight, ten hours a day and that is all you get. You know you want to be a part of their day, you want to add to the learning once you come home and you can't, it's gut wrenching. And on the other side, on the school side, it's no better. In addition to actually educating our kids, teachers are managing a ton of paperwork. Let's face it, they're actually managing parents and on top of that they're even running a business. The system is broken and Brightwheel is the solution. So let's jump in and take a look at how Brightwheel works. So with Brightwheel, teachers can easily check kids in from the mobile app, they can log activities and assessments during the day, they can send quick updates and they can even manage their business all in one place. And we're just seeing an amazing amount of photos every single day on Brightwheel and this is the reason you take it, you tag it and you are absolutely done. And now we're gonna look at the teacher app. So this is the teacher's room and we're gonna click on activities at the bottom here and this is all being done on paper today and so we've taken it and combined it and made it super fast and super easy. So we're gonna click on nap here and then we're gonna tag three kids that just went down for a nap. And the key about Brightwheel is that we're saving teachers time, you actually have measurably more time with kids every single day. And now we're going to flip over real quick to the parent experience. So let's jump to the mobile app. This is actually my little girl Serena and this is her day and as you can see I get a sense of not only what she's doing but what she's learning. And so when I come home I can actually have a conversation with her about it. My connection with my little girl is so much deeper because of Brightwheel and by the way in the middle of a pretty tough day it doesn't hurt to get a photo like this. Sharks, this is a unique opportunity to build a massive business that has a massive impact on people's everyday lives and that's something that we hear every day. So I hope you're joining Serena and our team in bringing Brightwheel to every preschool, every daycare, and every family across the globe."

Now Jason and I are of the generation that grew up online with computers, so naturally we met online. We eventually got married and you know what happens, we adopted more cats. The problem with cat toys today is this: they're cute, they're colorful, but when you take them home your cats play with them for about five minutes. These guys are basically thrown away. Imagine instead you could walk into a pet shop and there'd be an entire aisle dedicated to the wellness of your cat with products that enhance your kitty's lifestyle and really help you improve your relationship with your cat. Well, that's what we are doing at PBX Pet Design. For our first product, we created Shrew, the intelligent cat companion. As you can see in the video, Shrew entertains your cat while you're out for the day. Now we designed Shrew to mimic a small animal's motion so it ignites the hunting instinct of your little tiger. It's basically going to be your cat's new BFF. For our next product, we looked at the fact that cats groom each other as a form of social bonding. There's also evidence to suggest that your cat thinks you're a big cat, not a human. So why should you be left out of their intimate bonding ritual? Well, with Licky Brush, you don't have to be left out anymore. Licky Brush is a tongue-shaped brush you can use to finally lick your cat just like a mama cat likes her young."

College is expensive — I know because I'm a student. The cost of a university education rises every year, and students and parents are forced to take out student loans to cover the bill. This puts many students in overwhelming debt. But there's an alternative: scholarships. The only problem is, these scholarships are extremely hard to find. This causes millions of dollars in free money to go to waste because so many students don't even know this money exists. That's why I created Scholly, the mobile app that matches students with hundreds of potential scholarships. You simply enter a few pieces of information about yourself — like the state you live in, your GPA, your major — and there you go: a list of scholarships you qualify for, generated in just minutes. So, we have things like the Dolores Scholarship, the Bank of the Shark-based Scholarship, Mr. Ronaldo's Scholarship worth $1,000 — I love all of them. We love you all. Okay, you really got me there. You're the man. What can I say? Scholly isn't just a business — it's my passion. I want to help students like me find the money to go to college and achieve their dreams. So, investing in Scholly means you can help make a few dreams come true. Let's make it happen."

We're a husband and wife team from Milwaukee, Wisconsin and today we are seeking 150,000 in exchange for 10% of our company. Sharks, like so many people out there, we've got a real problem in the bedroom. Between his sleepwalking and my restless legs, there's a whole lot of action and not enough sleep. So that's why we invented Sleep Pod, a first of its kind sleep solution designed to simulate the feeling of being hugged or cuddled. Sleep Pod uses a specialized four-way stretch material that wraps around your entire body. As this fabric stretches, it wants to compress, providing a gentle calming pressure helping you to relax and fall asleep. Now I know what you're thinking, and you're right, it's essentially an adult swaddle, but Sleep Pod is so much more than that. It's made from a breathable material that doesn't trap heat, it's lightweight so it's easy to travel with, and best of all, it's machine washable. And my favorite part is your significant other can't steal your covers. But all seriousness, Sharks, we spend a third of our lives sleeping yet so many of us struggle to get a good night's rest. With Hug Sleep, we can bring some magic back into the bedroom and get people sleeping like babies again. So Sharks, who wants to jump in bed with us?"

It makes peanut butter better. Now get ready because for the first time in history on national tv we're going to download a sandwich. Oh wow, ah voila one downloaded sandwich. That's cool!

I decided we should take cake decorating classes as a way to spend some time together. Well, before we knew it, in October 2011, Wicked Good Cupcakes was born. We received tons of requests to ship our cupcakes nationwide. It was a big challenge though trying to figure out how to keep them fresh and intact, and that's when we came up with the idea of shipping them in a jar. Our cupcake jars are baked fresh daily. We layer them with homemade frosting and filling, ship them in gift boxes with spoons so they're ready to eat right out of the package. Basically, they appeal to anyone with a mouth. We're not afraid to work hard. Our days right now average 13 to 14 hours, plus mom's definitely getting her fair share of time with me.

Sharks, I know we just met but I want to talk to you about how you poop like a lot of people. If I wasn't in the privacy of my own home, I wasn't comfortable going number two because of the smell I might leave behind. Traditional bathroom aerosols just mask the stench, leaving a sticky film behind and a bathroom that smells like a stinky rose garden. And all these new drops and sprays used before going number two are cumbersome, leak in a purse, in a pant pocket. So I invented, wait for it, Plop Star, the world's most discreet and portable toilet odor eliminator. Each Plop Star tablet is individually wrapped for ideal portability. So how does Plop Star work? Just gently drop one tablet in the bowl before your performance, wait a few seconds before taking a seat. Plop Star starts dissolving instantly, releasing a buffer of essential oils on the surface of the water that block bathroom odors before they begin.

We're seeking 150,000 for a 15% stake in our company. We're an indie putter company that manufactures the most precise putters in the world. You might have heard the phrase drive for show and putt for dough; putting accounts for half the shots of an average golfer, so why are we blowing our money on drivers and shoddy putters? That is where Chronos comes in. We mill our putters down to one one-thousandth of an inch to make sure our putters are perfectly balanced. We start off with a solid block of steel and mill it for over two hours, transforming it from stage one, a solid block of steel, to stage two, a roughly milled putter, to stage three, a more refined build putter. It's a slow, labor-intensive process, but it's the right way to make a well-balanced putter. From there, each one is individually hand worked, including delicate deburring, polishing, and painting, all the while preserving that critical balance. The truth is, there's no putter out there that'll make you better overnight, but ours will help you put more consistently, and that might be the only difference between winning and losing. Plus, they're super sexy, so let's get the devil on the dance floor and give these putters a try."

        "Full_Pitch": "Hi Sharks, my name is Joe Balasteri, I'm from Chihola Pennsylvania and I'm here seeking a hundred and fifteen thousand dollars for fifteen percent equity in my company. Sharks, property owners can never feel too secure. You never know who's gonna hop your fence, break on your property in the middle of night and rummage through your things. These bandits cause thousands of dollars in damages a day. You know who I'm talking about? Raccoons. Looking in the pest control industry for the last 15 years, I've seen it all. These little bandits dig through our trash cans, break into our attics to breed and defecate in our pools. Getting rid of raccoons can be costly and of course there's no guarantee more won't move in to take their place. So that's why I invented the Critter Pricker, the most humane way to protect your property against raccoons and other pesky wildlife. Being that raccoons have hyper sensitive hands and a lack of depth perception, once they come in contact with the Critter Pricker's patented plastic strips, they quickly move on. Goodbye trash panda, hello peace of mind! Plastic strips snap together very easily either end to end or side to side to customize those locations you want to protect. Also, our live hinges allow you to bend and shape the product around square and circuit locations such as bird feeders and fences. The Critter Pricker won't just keep your property free of raccoons but of unwanted cats and even humans. So who wants to get their paws on the Critter Pricker and see how it works? I got some samples for you."

The most amazing thing of all is this isn't even the first time I've been on Shark Tank. Oh, that's right, Sharks, it's Les Cookson, the carsick bib guy from season two. I'm back again. Here's a little reminder: the carsick bib is the smart hands-free barf bag for kids. It's a bib, it's a bit, it's a carsick baby, it's a feedback too. Then you know when it happens. Don't worry, 'cause this time I'm not pitching a vomit necklace. I took that invention behind the barn and shot it. Yeah, you're welcome, Mr. Wonderful. Thank you. But I took what I learned from watching Shark Tank to grow one of my other inventions to massive sales. So Sharks, I am here asking $300,000 for 10% of my business, Lucid Art. At Lucid Art, we sell the Lucy drawing tool that can make anyone an artist and any artist a master. Set whatever you want to draw in front of the Lucy, look down to the viewing window, and draw over the reflected image to start your masterpiece in minutes. The Lucy is my reinvention of a classic art tool that has been used by artists for centuries. That's right, the old masters had help, and now that I've breathed a new life into this old device, all of today's artists and would-be artists can have help too. So Sharks, who wants to take a ride with an old friend and crush the modern art world for this reinvented historical drawing tool? Each of you have a Lucy in front of you, but I have one over here set up right at the draw, and I would love to invite Kevin to come up and try it out."

Well, there is some sugar but not too much and it's not our first ingredient the way it is in some other so-called better for you snack brands. So what is our first ingredient? It's chickpeas! Yes, beans! But Rule Breaker Snacks are so chewy and delicious you'd never guess being 100% plant-based is better for the planet and better for us. But there are some rules we never break, such as those that keep our snacks safe for school. So Rule Breaker contains no nuts. In fact, none of the common food allergens and no GMOs, no preservatives, but they taste absolutely incredible. Look at all those big chocolate chips! Who wants to come break some rules with me? Please dig into the samples in front of you. You have deep chocolate brownies which are like fudgy hunks of heaven studded with chocolate chips, chocolate chunk blondies which are like soft baked chewy chocolate chip cookies, birthday cake blondies which have white chocolate chips, then peanutter chocolate chip which tastes like peanut butter but it's nut free."

This is Umaro, seaweed that's been transformed from plant to protein. Seaweed is surprisingly high in protein and it's one of the fastest growing plants on earth. Seaweed requires no land, no fresh water, and no fertilizer to grow. It's a super food for the planet. We are pioneers at the forefront of a new frontier in protein. We're developing advanced systems in high-tech ocean farming and precision protein extraction that will unlock the ocean as our future source of protein. It's massive but none of that really matters unless it tastes good. Yep, so we're using it to create America's favorite food. It's the holy grail of plant-based meat: sizzly, salty, delicious. Yes, bacon is the first plant-based bacon your dad is gonna like. There's two kinds of bacon lovers in this world: the ones who like it crispy and the ones who like it soft and chewy. Either way you like it, we've made bacon that's just like the real thing and will blow your mind. Bacon is huge but it's just the beginning. We're asking for five hundred thousand dollars in exchange for two percent equity in the future. Who's ready to bring home the bacon?"

Moment is the first product in the world that lets you drink your meditation. And what makes it even better is that each moment has less than 15 calories, no sugar, no caffeine, nothing artificial, and oh my goodness, each one is absolutely delicious.

As a physical therapist, I use specific tools and techniques like muscle scraping to help enhance blood circulation, reduce pain, and speed up the recovery process. Yep, Dan's worked wonders on my body, but I can't bring him home with me. That's why we teamed up to create Sore Soap, the world's first do-it-yourself device made from all-natural analgesic essential oil powered soap. It's designed to replicate the same physical therapy tool you could get at a doctor's office. You know, soap's been around for centuries; as a matter of fact, muscle scraping has been too. We're just the first to combine them. So switch your old boring bar to Sore Soap. Just 90 seconds in the shower of scraping your muscles will reap the benefits of improved soft tissue health. Plus, Sore Soap smells amazing, lathers wonderfully, and leaves you feeling refreshed and recharged. Sharks, I scrape my muscles every day as I wash up, and believe me, I haven't felt this good since the '90s. So tell me, which one of you is sore enough to join us in the shower?"

We graduated from high school together, dropped out of college together and somehow out of all these years we've never been in a fight. Well, there's one argument that we've never seemed to settle and that argument is who makes the best sweet tea. I always thought my nana made the best tea and I would argue my mom makes the best tea. So, we decided to combine the two, settle that debate, and build the best tea brand in the world. And in 2021, we launched our company, Y'all Sweet Tea. When we launched Y'all Sweet Tea, I realized that other tea brands were not properly utilizing social media and influencers. So, we doubled down on social media and built a team of influencers that know a thing or two about sweet tea. So, Sharks, let me introduce you to one of our top influencers who has over 1 million followers, Mama Sue. Mama Sue. Everybody knows Mama Sue. Our influencers are Southern Grandmas. Hey, sharks.
