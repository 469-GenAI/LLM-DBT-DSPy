You might have heard the phrase drive for show and putt for dough; putting accounts for half the shots of an average golfer, so why are we blowing our money on drivers and shoddy putters? That is where Chronos comes in. We mill our putters down to one one-thousandth of an inch to make sure our putters are perfectly balanced. We start off with a solid block of steel and mill it for over two hours, transforming it from stage one, a solid block of steel, to stage two, a roughly milled putter, to stage three, a more refined build putter. It's a slow, labor-intensive process, but it's the right way to make a well-balanced putter. From there, each one is individually hand worked, including delicate deburring, polishing, and painting, all the while preserving that critical balance. The truth is, there's no putter out there that'll make you better overnight, but ours will help you put more consistently, and that might be the only difference between winning and losing. Plus, they're super sexy, so let's get the devil on the dance floor and give these putters a try."}

We're the inventors of the kettle grip. Kettlebells have become increasingly popular and provide dynamic full body workouts that build functional strength and range of motion. However, kettlebells are expensive, nearly impossible to travel with, and take up valuable floor space. So I began thinking of a way to turn the dumbbells that I already owned into kettlebells, and that's when the light bulb went up. I made a rough sketch and I sent it to my best friend Nancy. He was impressed by my talent as an artist; it looked like it was drawn by a five-year-old, but I could tell what it was supposed to be and I loved the concept. Kettle grip is a portable dumbbell adapter that allows you to do all of your favorite kettlebell exercises anywhere you can find a dumbbell. Simply open the kettle grip, insert any dumbbell, secure the latch, and you're ready for your Kettle grip workout. Clever Kettle grip is great for swings, upright rows, overhead presses, flexibility, and range of motion. We are seeking a $300,000 investment for 10% equity in our company. So Sharks, who's ready to get a grip?"}

Well, that's why we created the Turbo Trusser. The Turbo Trusser is a rapid trussing device used when cooking whole chickens and turkeys. Trussing is a technique that keeps the wings and legs close to the body; it cooks a bird more evenly. Traditionally, this is done with butcher's twine, which is messy and hard to work with, but with the Turbo Trusser, keeping your dinner nice and juicy is a breeze. Just hook the Turbo Trusser right into place, closing up the cavity and sealing all the juices to cook a perfect bird. Check out these incredible results, Sharks! You'll get a delicious juicy chicken or turkey every time. This product is so universal you can use it in ovens, grills, smokers, roasters, rotisseries, deep fryers, and even air fryers. And best of all, it's made of food-grade stainless steel and it's dishwasher safe, and it's made right here in the good old USA. So which one of you Sharks wants to take a bite out of the poultry industry?"}

You don't if it's one of ours. How do we get away with it? Well, let's examine some typical ingredients in brownies and blondies. Take eggs for example, oh there's no eggs in Rule Breaker and butter, oh there's no butter either. In fact, no animal products at all. Sugar? Well, there is some sugar but not too much and it's not our first ingredient the way it is in some other so-called better for you snack brands. So what is our first ingredient? It's chickpeas! Yes, beans! But Rule Breaker Snacks are so chewy and delicious you'd never guess being 100% plant-based is better for the planet and better for us. But there are some rules we never break, such as those that keep our snacks safe for school. So Rule Breaker contains no nuts. In fact, none of the common food allergens and no GMOs, no preservatives, but they taste absolutely incredible. Look at all those big chocolate chips! Who wants to come break some rules with me? Please dig into the samples in front of you. You have deep chocolate brownies which are like fudgy hunks of heaven studded with chocolate chips, chocolate chunk blondies which are like soft baked chewy chocolate chip cookies, birthday cake blondies which have white chocolate chips, then peanutter chocolate chip which tastes like peanut butter but it's nut free."}

Sharks, property owners can never feel too secure. You never know who's gonna hop your fence, break on your property in the middle of night and rummage through your things. These bandits cause thousands of dollars in damages a day. You know who I'm talking about? Raccoons. Looking in the pest control industry for the last 15 years, I've seen it all. These little bandits dig through our trash cans, break into our attics to breed and defecate in our pools. Getting rid of raccoons can be costly and of course there's no guarantee more won't move in to take their place. So that's why I invented the Critter Pricker, the most humane way to protect your property against raccoons and other pesky wildlife. Being that raccoons have hyper sensitive hands and a lack of depth perception, once they come in contact with the Critter Pricker's patented plastic strips, they quickly move on. Goodbye trash panda, hello peace of mind! Plastic strips snap together very easily either end to end or side to side to customize those locations you want to protect. Also, our live hinges allow you to bend and shape the product around square and circuit locations such as bird feeders and fences. The Critter Pricker won't just keep your property free of raccoons but of unwanted cats and even humans. So who wants to get their paws on the Critter Pricker and see how it works? I got some samples for you."}

Well, that used to be the case until this moment. Moment is a natural botanical beverage that reduces stress and feels like meditation. Moment uses a proprietary formulation that stimulates the same alpha brain waves as does meditation. We use three primary active ingredients to make that happen. Elanine, a natural extract of green tea for focus. Number two is Ashwagandha, an ancient ardic root for calmness. And number three is Tulsi, our holy basil, an adaptogenic herb for stress relief. Moment is the first product in the world that lets you drink your meditation. And what makes it even better is that each moment has less than 15 calories, no sugar, no caffeine, nothing artificial, and oh my goodness, each one is absolutely delicious. Sharks, stress is a major problem today more than ever, and this is the moment to solve it, man. I mean, what a performance. Yeah. So, Sharks, now it's time for you to take a moment for yourself. We've got all three of our flavors for you to sample. On your left, uh, you've got Tulsi Lemon, a drink I grew up having in Pakistan. You've got Roy Blood Orange inspired by South Africa, which is where Fahim is from."}
