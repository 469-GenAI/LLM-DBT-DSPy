I'm Tara and I'm Jason. We're the founders of PBX Pet Design and today we're asking for 300,000 for 15% of our company. Now Jason and I are of the generation that grew up online with computers, so naturally we met online. We eventually got married and you know what happens, we adopted more cats. The problem with cat toys today is this: they're cute, they're colorful, but when you take them home your cats play with them for about five minutes. These guys are basically thrown away. Imagine instead you could walk into a pet shop and there'd be an entire aisle dedicated to the wellness of your cat with products that enhance your kitty's lifestyle and really help you improve your relationship with your cat. Well, that's what we are doing at PBX Pet Design. For our first product, we created Shrew, the intelligent cat companion. As you can see in the video, Shrew entertains your cat while you're out for the day. Now we designed Shrew to mimic a small animal's motion so it ignites the hunting instinct of your little tiger. It's basically going to be your cat's new BFF. For our next product, we looked at the fact that cats groom each other as a form of social bonding. There's also evidence to suggest that your cat thinks you're a big cat, not a human. So why should you be left out of their intimate bonding ritual? Well, with Licky Brush, you don't have to be left out anymore. Licky Brush is a tongue-shaped brush you can use to finally lick your cat just like a mama cat likes her young."}

Sharks, what do y'all do when you're having a bad hair day or those days you just don't feel like washing your hair? We can't all be 'no hair, don't care' like Mr. Wonderful over here. Some of us just can't put on a hat because our natural hair can get damaged. One go-to option is the head wrap, but traditional head wraps can be made from harsh fabrics like cotton or polyester that can damage the hair, and learning how to tie them can be time-consuming and confusing. That's why I created the first-ever satin-lined easy tie head wraps. Yugo Natural wraps are not only super stylish and super easy to use, they're designed to protect and promote the health of your hair with super soft satin lining that reduces friction and retains the moisture in your hair. Our core line features cool turbans from lots of styles for both women and men, so you can look good on the go no matter what kind of hair you have. And that's not all! Our latest invention, the swim turban, is made with silicone lining so anyone can enjoy the water without worrying about the harsh effects of salt water and chlorine on your hair. Today, we built a massive customer base directly online, but we're here to make Yugo Natural a household name. So, Sharks, which one of you is ready to wrap this deal up?"}

As filters get dirty, they stop working, and what this doesn't catch, you and your loved ones are breathing in. This includes pollen, pet dander, mold, smoke, bacteria, and even CO2. And that's why I created Whoosh, a better air filter that's smart enough to know when it needs to be changed. Let me show you how it works. The smart air filter is made of two parts: a filter and a reusable frame. The filter is made from the highest quality materials and is placed inside the frame. The filter connects to Wi-Fi and has integrated sensors that track the performance of your filter, so when it's time to change, we send a notification and a filter replacement in the mail. With Whoosh, it's easier to use, smart, and produces less waste than traditional cardboard filters. So sharks, who's with me to Whoosh for smarter, cleaner air?"}

It's made with nutrient-dense ingredients and it supports gut health and wellness. It's made from real milk sourced from smallholder family-owned farms, and each pint boasts 22g of protein, prebiotic fiber, gut-healthy probiotics, and a unique blend of immunity-boosting superfoods, all of which work better together, kind of like us.

While our relationship with dogs has completely modernized, most dog products are still clunky, inconvenient, or something even your dog would be embarrassed by. The most important thing that your dog needs besides pets and cuddles is water. But who here has tried the 'make your hand into a bowl' method? It's messy, wastes water, and doesn't work well. Or you can pour the contents of your water bottle into a portable bowl, and when your dog doesn't drink at all, you're left having to throw it out. And public water bowls can infect your pup with creepy bacteria, and let's be honest, we know you kiss that mouth daily. So we invented the Springer travel bottle, the best way to give your dog water anywhere at any time. Can you simply squeeze the bottle, the bowl will fill up with water, when your dog is done drinking, release the bottle and the water goes back into the bottle. No mess, no fuss, and no wasting water. This is just the first of many innovative products in the pipeline that solve problems pet owners face every day. So Sharks, who's ready to join our pack and make Springer top dog of the pet industry?"}

I'm here today seeking two hundred thousand dollars for 10% equity in my world-saving product. Sharks, you must have some primal desires we can't always control very well. One of those primal desires is the desire to build fires, specifically campfires. Now we all love a good campfire, but the devastation created by human-caused wildfires is heartbreaking, oftentimes totally preventable. So I set out to create something that would be clean, easy to use, and would keep us safe, something we can drink a beer around or, why Mr. Wonderful, and tell a great story. That's why I created Lava Box. Now normally we would never light Lava Box indoors, this is Shark Tank, let's fire this baby up! (laughs) So Lava Box is deceptively simple. It starts with a military-style ammo can. You just pop the top, check the propane, light the lighter that we provide, and then slowly turn on the gas. You guys ready? All right, here we go! There it is, pretty cool! So it can go from Kumbaya all the way to heavy metal fire. All right, let's turn it down. So about a foot out of the box is actually the perfect level for roasting marshmallows for s'mores. This is also what everybody asks me, 'Josh, can you cook on it?' And the answer is a resounding, 'You betcha!' So you can lift the Lava Box up to pass fire restrictions or close up the legs, pop it on top, and now you're ready for tailgating burgers at the same time. That's cool, Sharks! I think I've created the perfect grab-and-go solution for a very modern problem. So the question is, who's going to gather on the Lava Box and get lit with me, baby?"}

Today I'm seeking $250,000 in exchange for 5% stake in my company. Now millions of kids each year dream of playing in the NBA, Mark, I'm sure you were one of them. I was. But whenever you get to high school, coaches usually expect you to shoot up to 500 shots every day. But usually this takes about six hours at a time and good luck trying to find somebody to chase down your rebounds, Mr. Wonderful, it's not gonna happen. That's why we created the Grind Machine, the world's first portable shooting machine that captures your made and missed shots, automatically passes the ball back out to you, and collapses down into the size of a duffel bag within 90 seconds. Simply set up our shooting machine under any basketball goal and bam, you're ready to lock in. Our shooting machine rotates 190 degrees, manually pass into five positions on the court so you can train like a great athlete from anywhere along the arc. Unlike professional machines that are sold to the Mavericks, Grind is made for the consumer, being the lowest cost machine on the market today. So Sharks, who's ready to help Grind develop interactive game-changing products one sport at a time?"}

We all know these are questions parents have to ask multiple times a day. Let's face it, kids don't like stopping what they're doing to wash their hands and when they do, they don't wash properly or for the right amount of time. Plus, kids love drawing on everything: tables, walls, and even on their own bodies. We put these two problems together and created a solution: Soapen, a colorful soap-filled pen that kids can draw with. With Soapen, kids can draw their germs away. Kids draw fun designs all over their hands, just like the shark Aman is making right now. Then they rub their hands together and rinse off, just like normal. Soapen's gentle, vibrant, and stain-free formula was designed to make kids thoroughly wash their hands for 20 to 40 seconds to get all that colorful soap off, creating healthier kids and happier parents. Regardless of a pandemic, hand washing with soap is a golden rule of prevention; it can save one out of three children from catching the most deadly diseases globally.

Brightwheel is the mobile app for preschools, daycares, and families and we are completely revolutionizing early education. Now I believe all of us are parents here and I want to ask when you come home after a long day and you ask your kids what did you learn in school today, does it sound familiar? This is the experience for millions of parents across America every single day and especially for younger kids. You've been apart from your little human being for six, eight, ten hours a day and that is all you get. You know you want to be a part of their day, you want to add to the learning once you come home and you can't, it's gut wrenching. And on the other side, on the school side, it's no better. In addition to actually educating our kids, teachers are managing a ton of paperwork. Let's face it, they're actually managing parents and on top of that they're even running a business. The system is broken and Brightwheel is the solution. So let's jump in and take a look at how Brightwheel works. So with Brightwheel, teachers can easily check kids in from the mobile app, they can log activities and assessments during the day, they can send quick updates and they can even manage their business all in one place. And we're just seeing an amazing amount of photos every single day on Brightwheel and this is the reason you take it, you tag it and you are absolutely done. And now we're gonna look at the teacher app. So this is the teacher's room and we're gonna click on activities at the bottom here and this is all being done on paper today and so we've taken it and combined it and made it super fast and super easy. So we're gonna click on nap here and then we're gonna tag three kids that just went down for a nap. And the key about Brightwheel is that we're saving teachers time, you actually have measurably more time with kids every single day. And now we're going to flip over real quick to the parent experience. So let's jump to the mobile app. This is actually my little girl Serena and this is her day and as you can see I get a sense of not only what she's doing but what she's learning. And so when I come home I can actually have a conversation with her about it. My connection with my little girl is so much deeper because of Brightwheel and by the way in the middle of a pretty tough day it doesn't hurt to get a photo like this. Sharks, this is a unique opportunity to build a massive business that has a massive impact on people's everyday lives and that's something that we hear every day. So I hope you're joining Serena and our team in bringing Brightwheel to every preschool, every daycare, and every family across the globe."}

We have sweats, denim jackets, backpacks, and accessories, all made of sustainable materials. Then click customize now. Our design platform opens up and you'll find over 500 premium patches to choose from. Just drag and drop and place them anywhere you want on the style, the front, back, sleeves, and even the hood. Step three is our job. In our studio, we bring your child's masterpiece to life. As you can see, May is wearing the final product, just like the one designed on screen. Nice. Nice.

The only problem is once the snow falls, we have to put our bikes away. Don't get us wrong, we love skiing. What's better than a batch of fresh powder? So what if you could take the best from both of these sports and combine them into a single product that is both easy to learn and outrageously fun? Well, guess what, Sharks? We've done it! Introducing Tangent Ski Bikes! Oh, that is cool! How safe? It looks dangerous! That's why I love it! Check these things out! We've carved out a new way to hit the slopes. Our combination of a high-performance design and traditional bicycle parts gives outdoor enthusiasts something that has never been available before.

Here are real messages these successful passionate guys have gotten on General dating apps: my friend says you have four cats that's four red flags. H do you sleep with that thing? Would you be willing to give up your cats for me? Studies show that men who have cats in their profile photos perform worse and get fewer matches on General dating apps. That's why we created Tabby, the cat person's dating app. All right boys, go be yourselves. Tabby is a safe space. Tabby is a familiar dating app; you swipe left or you swipe right on people but it also has a specific area asking you about your cats, like how much do you spend on your cat a month or does he or she sleep in the bed with you every night? Of course she does, all my cats do. Tabby also provides a community space for everyone on the app, the cat tree, where you can share your favorite cat-friendly cafe or suggest dating ideas like volunteering at Sterling's nonprofit or curling up with me and my four kitties in a nice bottle of wine. So sharks, say goodbye to these local adoptable kittens for now; the boys will be right back and join us as we help people determine who they want to spend the rest of their nine lives with based on their love for cats with Tabby."}

Number two, portable; our portable units can charge an electric vehicle anytime and anywhere, making any location a charging station. And of course, the most important factor: speed.

Our babies suffered from boogers, yes them up all the time leading to countless sleepless nights for both Us and Them. Unfortunately, everything on the market was for wet mucus but that wasn't our problem and that inspired me to create Oogie Bear, the first baby booger picker. I designed a Yogi Bear scoop and Luke to tackle all types of boogers. Our signature bear head design isn't just cute, it helps prevent the tips from going in too far allowing parents to be in and out quickly. It worked so great we knew we had something special.

I was investing more time trying to find missing pieces than my daughter was spending playing with them. Not to mention, walking around the house at night was like navigating a minefield of loose toys. One wrong step and BAM! I scream, she wakes up, and I still have a house full of toys to clean up. Toys should bring joy to a home, not mess. That's why I created Play Mey. Play Mey is a portable dollhouse for quality play on the go and less mess at home. Our cases were inspired by vintage tin lunch boxes that open on both sides to reveal two interchangeable rooms. Our magnetic floors with attached wooden furniture means no loose pieces, no lost pieces, and no more bottom of the foot ois for moms and dads. When playtime is over, simply close your case, put them on a shelf, stack them in a pile, or hang them on a hook for easy clean-up and all-in-one storage. Whether you're planning a long car ride or just looking to clear the clutter in your home, Play Mey keeps your child's imagination active and your cleaning to-do list a little bit shorter. So who's ready to help me save the souls of parents all across America with Play Mey?"}

Today I'm seeking sixty thousand dollars for 20% equity of my company. Now Sharks, there are usually two ways to feel instant satisfaction after a great workout: one, you push yourself to the limit where you're so sore the next morning it just feels so good; and two, being covered head to toe in your own sweat. But with the current sauna suits on the market today, if you don't clean and dry them properly, you might irritate your skin really bad. Mark, I know exactly\u2014I sweat when I think about it, right? I mean, the only other option is using a trash bag. Shredskins is the first and only single-use sauna suit on the market today. At Shredskins, we use an eco-friendly plastic to conveniently show you your massive sweat progress. With our unique design, we have elastic around the waist and the wrist, and on top of that, a drawstring on the hood. This allows you to trap heat, minimize your time warming up, and maximize your time actually working out, and it just makes you sweat faster. So I hope you make a deal with me quickly. But see, that may be their favorite part about Shredskins, but let me show you my favorite part about Shredskins. Kevin, show them how to really do it. Now Sharks, I know what you're thinking when you hear single-use, but we use an octodegradable plastic, a newly developed resin to help break that plastic down even faster as we strive to be as eco-conscious as possible. This way, you can feel just as good about using Shredskins as you do wearing Shredskins during the workout. So Sharks, which one of you wants to shed fast, easy sweat and shred fast, easy money with Shredskins? You guys all have samples in front of you, check those out while I put my shirt on. Great job!"}

But I took what I learned from watching Shark Tank to grow one of my other inventions to massive sales. So Sharks, I am here asking $300,000 for 10% of my business, Lucid Art. At Lucid Art, we sell the Lucy drawing tool that can make anyone an artist and any artist a master. Set whatever you want to draw in front of the Lucy, look down to the viewing window, and draw over the reflected image to start your masterpiece in minutes. The Lucy is my reinvention of a classic art tool that has been used by artists for centuries. That's right, the old masters had help, and now that I've breathed a new life into this old device, all of today's artists and would-be artists can have help too. So Sharks, who wants to take a ride with an old friend and crush the modern art world for this reinvented historical drawing tool? Each of you have a Lucy in front of you, but I have one over here set up right at the draw, and I would love to invite Kevin to come up and try it out."}

We graduated from high school together, dropped out of college together and somehow out of all these years we've never been in a fight. Well, there's one argument that we've never seemed to settle and that argument is who makes the best sweet tea. I always thought my nana made the best tea and I would argue my mom makes the best tea. So, we decided to combine the two, settle that debate, and build the best tea brand in the world. And in 2021, we launched our company, Y'all Sweet Tea. When we launched Y'all Sweet Tea, I realized that other tea brands were not properly utilizing social media and influencers. So, we doubled down on social media and built a team of influencers that know a thing or two about sweet tea. So, Sharks, let me introduce you to one of our top influencers who has over 1 million followers, Mama Sue. Mama Sue. Everybody knows Mama Sue. Our influencers are Southern Grandmas. Hey, sharks. I may not know all those fancy dances on social media, but I've been drinking tea for 71 years. And honey, I can tell you y'all sweet tea is the best I've ever had.

I decided we should take cake decorating classes as a way to spend some time together. Well, before we knew it, in October 2011, Wicked Good Cupcakes was born. We received tons of requests to ship our cupcakes nationwide. It was a big challenge though trying to figure out how to keep them fresh and intact, and that's when we came up with the idea of shipping them in a jar. Our cupcake jars are baked fresh daily. We layer them with homemade frosting and filling, ship them in gift boxes with spoons so they're ready to eat right out of the package. Basically, they appeal to anyone with a mouth. We're not afraid to work hard. Our days right now average 13 to 14 hours, plus mom's definitely getting her fair share of time with me.

As a physical therapist, I use specific tools and techniques like muscle scraping to help enhance blood circulation, reduce pain, and speed up the recovery process. Yep, Dan's worked wonders on my body, but I can't bring him home with me. That's why we teamed up to create Sore Soap, the world's first do-it-yourself device made from all-natural analgesic essential oil powered soap. It's designed to replicate the same physical therapy tool you could get at a doctor's office. You know, soap's been around for centuries; as a matter of fact, muscle scraping has been too. We're just the first to combine them. So switch your old boring bar to Sore Soap. Just 90 seconds in the shower of scraping your muscles will reap the benefits of improved soft tissue health. Plus, Sore Soap smells amazing, lathers wonderfully, and leaves you feeling refreshed and recharged. Sharks, I scrape my muscles every day as I wash up, and believe me, I haven't felt this good since the '90s. So tell me, which one of you is sore enough to join us in the shower?"}

He collected hobbies; he loved painting and singing and golf and tennis and wood carving. And because of this, from age 5 years old on, everybody knew him as FID, which is short for Fiddler. My grandpa always told me the most important thing in life was to love everything I do, and I've really based my life on that advice. Gramps passed away a few years ago, and his death was hard for the whole family. Receiving his remains after the cremation didn't make it any easier. Sharks, this is how 1.9 million Americans every year receive the remains of their loved ones following cremation. This zip-tied plastic bag is how I received Gramps, and that experience was awkward and uncomfortable. Every year, millions of Americans have poor experiences with ashes and urns just like I did, and to avoid them, they're hiding one of their most treasured possessions in basements and closets and garages. So my company, Parting Stone, invented a new form of human and animal remains following the cremation. Parting Stone service returns the remains in a form that resembles a collection of smooth stones. The appearance of each collection of stones varies naturally from person to person, returning different hues and textures and colors for each individual. Now families tell us about how they were able to hold their loved ones again, share the remains with their community, and spread the stones in meaningful places. Solidified remains are giving families a comforting way to remember their loved ones every single day. Sharks, I'm here today seeking $400,000 for 5% of my company. I believe that our past loved ones deserve better, and your investment can bring a new opportunity to the millions of Americans who are struggling through loss."}

Sharks, the plastic crisis spans across our cities, landfills, and our oceans and surprisingly one of the biggest culprits is the laundry industry.

You very simply take one sheet of detergent and you toss it in with your dirty laundry. At the end of a wash cycle, it leaves your laundry soft, fresh, and clean every time.

It seems I never have enough when I'm cooking or serving food. You might say just buy more tongs, come on, nobody wants to do that. Look at these things, they're large, they're clunky, they take up space and every time you need them, they're buried in a sink full of dirty dishes. And that's why I invented Any Tongs. It's a simple compact tool that transforms ordinary utensils into versatile kitchen tongs. Check out how they work! You just grab any combination of forks or spoons, insert the handles into the rubberized slot, give it a firm tug, and instant tongs! When you're working with multiple dishes, you don't have to worry about cross-contaminating food. You just attach and reload with clean ones. That's pretty cool! And when you're done, just pop them out and toss them in the wash. You got two spoons, boom! Now you got tongs. How about forks? Boom! Any tongs, any time! So who's ready to assemble some tongs and grab a piece of this company?"}

Don't worry, we're still your biggest fans, it's our dream to get a deal so we're back seeking ninety thousand dollars for five percent of our ornament saving business. Sharks, we all know ornaments are fragile and even just bumping into the tree can make your ornaments fall and break, not to mention if you have dogs or cats. Flimsy hooks and simple ribbons just don't work, they only drape over a branch waiting for accidents to happen. It's about time this changed by actually anchoring ornaments to the branch. Ornament Anchor keeps your memory safe and secure. This is an ornament that Ayan made when he was two years old, I'd be really upset if it broke. To secure it, I simply take Ornament Anchor and I put it through the hole, then I pull it up and over, I find a branch, put it on and pull. That's it! With Ornament Anchor, you'll never have to worry about another precious memory being broken on the floor. Ornament Anchor can hold up to 10 pounds so you feel confident your ornaments are secure and you'll never have to worry about pets knocking off your ornaments again. Now it's time to put Ornament Anchor to the ultimate test! Goggles everyone, that's including you sharks! Our most precious ornaments are right here on this tree so the stakes are high. Okay Lori, when I say go, can you press that bright red button in front of you? Okay, three, two, one, go! Wow! Oh wow, pretty impressive!

Traditional bathroom aerosols just mask the stench, leaving a sticky film behind and a bathroom that smells like a stinky rose garden. And all these new drops and sprays used before going number two are cumbersome, leak in a purse, in a pant pocket. So I invented, wait for it, Plop Star, the world's most discreet and portable toilet odor eliminator. Each Plop Star tablet is individually wrapped for ideal portability. So how does Plop Star work? Just gently drop one tablet in the bowl before your performance, wait a few seconds before taking a seat. Plop Star starts dissolving instantly, releasing a buffer of essential oils on the surface of the water that block bathroom odors before they begin.

It's time for a sea change and we're building something that can change everything. This is Umaro, seaweed that's been transformed from plant to protein. Seaweed is surprisingly high in protein and it's one of the fastest growing plants on earth. Seaweed requires no land, no fresh water, and no fertilizer to grow. It's a super food for the planet. We are pioneers at the forefront of a new frontier in protein. We're developing advanced systems in high-tech ocean farming and precision protein extraction that will unlock the ocean as our future source of protein. It's massive but none of that really matters unless it tastes good. Yep, so we're using it to create America's favorite food. It's the holy grail of plant-based meat: sizzly, salty, delicious. Yes, bacon is the first plant-based bacon your dad is gonna like. There's two kinds of bacon lovers in this world: the ones who like it crispy and the ones who like it soft and chewy. Either way you like it, we've made bacon that's just like the real thing and will blow your mind. Bacon is huge but it's just the beginning. We're asking for five hundred thousand dollars in exchange for two percent equity in the future. Who's ready to bring home the bacon?"}

That's right, Sharks! Working from home in the past year, I got tired of being such a slob at my desk. Like many, I love to enjoy a snack while I'm gaming or working, but keeping your hands and devices clean all at the same time is a challenge. I even tried using these chopsticks, but they're super inefficient. So I asked myself, there's gotta be a better way, and that was the Bertha Snack! Oh lord, it streamlines snacking and keeps your hands and devices clean while you're working, gaming, typing, texting, or swiping. It installs between your pointer and middle finger and keeps your hands completely mobile and free. By installing Snack Div, you'll be more hygienic, more productive, and you'll look super cool.

Oh my gosh, you think that piece of junk is gonna change your game of coffee? You're crazy! You're probably wondering who's this guy who's been sitting in a coffee cup for the last hour. My name is Ross Smith, I'm a social media influencer, I have over 45 million followers across all platforms, and my mission is to make the world smile. My friend Kwaku created a solution that was so good that I had to partner up with them, and together we both created the one and only Brumachen. The brew market is a single-serve portable brewer that makes a whole cup of coffee at a push of a button, so no more waiting in the long lines or stalling in drive-throughs. I've taken the Brumachen all around the world, in cabs, on boats, camping, you name it! It is extremely portable. Now Kwaku will show you how it works. Sharks, pay attention to the screen. First, you plug it in, you pour your water in, doesn't matter the temperature, you insert any single-serve coffee pod, oh wow, and with a push of a button, in a short five minutes, guys, you have a fresh cup of coffee ready to go anywhere, anytime. Now we'd like to ask you for one million dollars in exchange for 10% equity in our company and one cup of coffee. You know what? It's giving season! Two cups of coffee! Here we go! Well, Sharks, we're gonna make a brew right now. Ross, can you please get me a coffee pod from that tent? Huh? Oh man, what the heck? Kwaku, yeah Ross, that's one thousand coffee pods! That's the amount the average American will use this year. Winning this waste plastic pods is absolutely wasteful. It's why at Brumachen we didn't stop at one innovation, we went beyond. We created this: it's a biodegradable single-serve coffee pod made out of materials like sugar cane and tree fibers. Guys, those pods take 450 years to biodegrade; this takes 180 days. We don't got time for that! Ain't nobody got time for that! Truly, that's why you have the opportunity to put your money into something that isn't just a product; it goes beyond that. It preserves the planet for the next generation. Well, Sharks, are you ready to make Brumachen the next big thing?"}

Crayol Essence has the liquid gold of the Caribbean, the most nourishing oil you'll ever want to use for your hair, skin, and body. We're talking about a rare beauty secret called Haitian castor oil. Let's show you how we make liquid gold. After six months of harvesting, the best castor seeds are hand selected by women artisans. The seeds are then pressed using a pestle and mortar, then they are roasted and simmered to perfection. After the oil has decanted like a fine wine, a master is used to filter out any debris, leaving you with the raw and pure Haitian castor oil we all love. So whether it's moisturizing kinky curly hair, promoting thicker lashes or brows, or relieving dry itchy skin, we have the most high performing natural products for you. But wait, there's more! Crayol Essence creates work for over 300 farmers and women producers. So Sharks, who's ready to help us build a billion dollar business and share with the world the true beauty that Haiti has to offer? Another Sharks, thank you guys so much."}

I live in beautiful Salt Lake City, Utah. And I'm the founder of Chapul. As an environmentalist, I'm very concerned about the future of our planet. And so that's what inspired me to create an eco-friendly energy bar. Right now, we work in a very small kitchen and we make all the bars by hand. Our product is the first of its kind in the world. It contains an extremely healthy, sustainable form of protein that we like to refer to as our secret ingredient. Hello, Chapul. This is Pat speaking. We're growing every month and we can't keep up with demand. We need an investment from the Sharks to increase our production and get the word out about our amazing product. Yeah, stoked on the new design. It looks good. Starting to pool has been a challenge. People have called us crazy and said that the idea would never work. Wanting a deal today goes well beyond my desire for personal success. I want to propel this protein as the food of the future. My name is Pat Crowley from Salt Lake City, Utah. My company is Chapul and I'm asking $50,000 in exchange for 5% equity of our company. At Chapul, we're changing the way people think about food, and we do it with an energy bar. But what separates us from the thousands of competitors isn't the delicious melee dates or the organic dark chocolate. No, it's our sustainable, eco-friendly form of protein that goes into every single bar. I'll show you, but first, a joke. Why are frogs so happy? Why? Why? Because they eat what bugs them. And now so can you with Chipool Cricket bars? Oh, you got to be kidding. Crickets are an extremely sustainable form of protein. They go into each one of our bars. Oh, insects are eaten in over half the countries around the globe. And we think it's about time that Americans catch up with the rest of the world. There is no way I'm eating that. All right. We have a Thailand themed coconut ginger lime. This one? Yep. Aztec bar is dark chocolate coffee cayenne. And then we have an all American peanut butter and chocolate. Why not? Right. They're crickets, not cockroaches. Correct. We actually make a flower out of the crickets, so you won't see any legs or antennas. You first. Must we eat it? Sure. You're obviously jumping at the opportunity here to get on board with a growing global business. So, who wants to join Chapul and help us to feed the revolution?"}

The torture of my peers was exhausting until I finally decided to make my haters my motivators and embrace my beautiful brows. I searched for brow products but nothing worked for me, so what did I do? I decided to make my own. Introducing Tania Speaks Organic Skincare, a powerful plant-based brow gel that tames thick brows and grows thin brows. It's organic, lightweight, contains no harsh chemicals, and actually works for brow growth and styling. And it's not just our brow gel thriving; we created other products like our foaming cleanser, resurfacing toner, facial moisturizer, and for the guys, the organic beard oil. Our products are carefully formulated with natural ingredients like aloe vera, carrot seed, oatmeal, and vanilla honey. I turned my trauma into triumph; I turned my bullies into bucks by blending innovation, beauty, and confidence in one organic package.

We're here today seeking 250,000 for five percent of our company, Storage Scholars. So guys, think back to your first year of college. It's the last week of school, you're saying goodbye to all the new friends you just met and you're up late studying when you get the text message from Mom, 'Hey, good luck on your last exam tomorrow sweetie, are you all set to move out?' The panic sets in. You don't have a car to buy boxes, you haven't reserved that storage unit, and you don't even remember how that sectional couch got into your dorm room. Well, that is where we come in. You can simply go online and create an account, you can add your parent to overlook your order information, you can pay a 50 fully refundable deposit, and we'll handle your entire move out for you. Students are given boxes, tape, bubble wrap, and labels on campus if we prefer final exams. They pack up their belongings, lock up their room, and go home. We have a partnership with their university to unlock that room once the campus is empty and will move everything into storage for the summer. We'll even have all their belongings ready and waiting in their new room when they return to campus the following semester. So Sam, who does all this moving? That's the best part. All the moving is done by trained fellow students, creating high paying jobs on campus. So Sharks, as two 18-year-olds terrified at the thought of student debt, we built Storage Scholars in college, which allowed each of us to graduate debt free. Who's ready to join us on our mission to empower students across America to do the same?"}

I developed large breasts at a young age and they just destroyed my back and my neck and my shoulders. I used to have to wear not one, not two, three sports bras just to play soccer like and keep the girls in place without losing an eye. And I am not alone, there are 50 million women today in the United States with large breasts struggling to find support and comfortable options. That's why I developed patent-pending stays technology that you can only find on a Behave bra because I know from personal experience large breasts need a lot more than just lift. Let me show you how it works. So stays are stretchy pieces of fabric and they live in the cup of every Behave bra. They encapsulate each breast and ensure that both of the girls are staying in their assigned seats. They're kind of like a soft seat belt but for your bust and stays are so secure that they keep you supported even if you go sideways. So stays get rid of boob smash, boob jiggle, and boob sweat and they are a huge reason my customers tell me Behave bras is not just the most supportive thing in the bra drawer but it's also the most beautiful. So you guys have Behave bras in front of you and I really am super excited to show you the product."}

I'm from Philadelphia, PA, and my company is Scholly. I'm seeking $40,000 for 15% of my company. College is expensive \u2014 I know because I'm a student. The cost of a university education rises every year, and students and parents are forced to take out student loans to cover the bill. This puts many students in overwhelming debt. But there's an alternative: scholarships. The only problem is, these scholarships are extremely hard to find. This causes millions of dollars in free money to go to waste because so many students don't even know this money exists. That's why I created Scholly, the mobile app that matches students with hundreds of potential scholarships. You simply enter a few pieces of information about yourself \u2014 like the state you live in, your GPA, your major \u2014 and there you go: a list of scholarships you qualify for, generated in just minutes. So, we have things like the Dolores Scholarship, the Bank of the Shark-based Scholarship, Mr. Ronaldo's Scholarship worth $1,000 \u2014 I love all of them. We love you all. Okay, you really got me there. You're the man. What can I say? Scholly isn't just a business \u2014 it's my passion. I want to help students like me find the money to go to college and achieve their dreams. So, investing in Scholly means you can help make a few dreams come true. Let's make it happen."}

Pooch Paper is already recycled non-chlorine bleach paper that's 100% compostable, 100% biodegradable, made right here in the USA and manufactured using renewable energy. So in three very simple steps, simply take a piece of Pooch Paper, grab your doggy's duty no matter how big or small, twist the play-doh size of the paper, which by the way on both sides is grease resistant, and then toss in the trash. So Sharks, nature is calling and Pooch Paper is picking up. Who's going to help me save this planet one pup at a time?"}

And there was no place to put my diaper bag but on the dirty restroom floor. Not the floor! I tried to keep bending down to get the diapers and then the wipes and then the change of clothes, but there was nowhere to put them on the surface and the safety strap was broken and my purse kept falling off my shoulder. I dropped my pacifier and all I kept thinking was how could I put my precious cargo down on something so filthy? It's so dirty! I know who knows what germs were festering? When was it last sanitized? Forget this! I set out loud, I can make a better one. Introducing PL, the world's first and only self-sanitizing diaper changing table for public restrooms. Every time you close the table, PL's patented UVC light system gets to work to protect babies. PL's UVC light sanitizes the entire surface, eliminating 99.9% of harmful bacteria and viruses, all within 60 seconds. PL's multi-purpose handles keep your diaper bag off the restroom floor and your hands free to change your child or catch that rogue pacifier before it hits the ground.

Sharks, like so many people out there, we've got a real problem in the bedroom. Between his sleepwalking and my restless legs, there's a whole lot of action and not enough sleep. So that's why we invented Sleep Pod, a first of its kind sleep solution designed to simulate the feeling of being hugged or cuddled. Sleep Pod uses a specialized four-way stretch material that wraps around your entire body. As this fabric stretches, it wants to compress, providing a gentle calming pressure helping you to relax and fall asleep. Now I know what you're thinking, and you're right, it's essentially an adult swaddle, but Sleep Pod is so much more than that. It's made from a breathable material that doesn't trap heat, it's lightweight so it's easy to travel with, and best of all, it's machine washable. And my favorite part is your significant other can't steal your covers. But all seriousness, Sharks, we spend a third of our lives sleeping yet so many of us struggle to get a good night's rest. With Hug Sleep, we can bring some magic back into the bedroom and get people sleeping like babies again. So Sharks, who wants to jump in bed with us?"}

Today we are seeking 250,000 in exchange for 10% of our company Calm Strips. Calm Strips are a cool new way to help people reduce their anxiety and that is just scratching at the surface. Have you ever had a day like my animated friend Charlie here? This traffic is stressing him out, this cartoon Cloud came out of nowhere and Charlie forgot his umbrella. Oh Charlie! And now his phone is blowing up with angry messages from his comically evil boss. We've all gotten them, but this brings Charlie's anxiety to an all-time high. Luckily, Charlie remembers he has Calm Strips, a healthy way to calm and ground himself. Calm Strips might look like any other sticker, but they're actually textured sensory adhesives. People everywhere are rubbing, scratching, or picking at the textured surface of their Calm Strips to help reduce fidgeting, increase focus, and regulate restless energy. They're reusable and residue-free, meaning they can be stuck to your phone, your laptop, your desk. Teachers and students alike love them because it helps kids manage their own restless energy without disrupting the rest of the class. So Sharks, who wants to invest in Calm Strips and show the world how easy it is to take a little bit of calm with you everywhere?"}

Do you think about what you put on your pits every day? I didn't until I learned that most conventional antiperspirants are made out of this and I didn't want this going on my body. Sure, I tried natural deodorants but they all either irritated my skin or left me smelling like a human gym bag and that's why I created Curie, an aluminum-free deodorant that actually works made with luxury Skin Care Quality ingredients. Say goodbye to embarrassing BO, ugly bumps, and painful rashes and say hello to perfect pits. Curie uses sage oil and probiotics to beat the stink, arrowroot powder to absorb the sweat, and chamomile and aloe to soothe those delicate pits. And it doesn't stop there, Curie's line of Better Body Basics also includes our full body deodorant spray, whipped body wash, and innovative pit detox mask. All our products are made with clean ingredients, smell amazing, and they actually work. Don't believe me? I'm in the Shark Tank right now and my armpits are completely dry. Kevin, go and smell them! I don't know, sharks, who wants to help me build my armpit empire?"}
