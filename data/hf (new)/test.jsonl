You know, Dan and I have been athletes our whole lives, but as these bones get older, our muscles just don't recover as quickly, that's for sure. That's why I go see this guy for help. As a physical therapist, I use specific tools and techniques like muscle scraping to help enhance blood circulation, reduce pain, and speed up the recovery process. Yep, Dan's worked wonders on my body, but I can't bring him home with me. That's why we teamed up to create Sore Soap, the world's first do-it-yourself device made from all-natural analgesic essential oil powered soap. It's designed to replicate the same physical therapy tool you could get at a doctor's office. You know, soap's been around for centuries; as a matter of fact, muscle scraping has been too. We're just the first to combine them. So switch your old boring bar to Sore Soap. Just 90 seconds in the shower of scraping your muscles will reap the benefits of improved soft tissue health. Plus, Sore Soap smells amazing, lathers wonderfully, and leaves you feeling refreshed and recharged. Sharks, I scrape my muscles every day as I wash up, and believe me, I haven't felt this good since the '90s. So tell me, which one of you is sore enough to join us in the shower?"}
