{"Uprising Food": "next up is a healthier version of an indulgence [Music] hi sharks i'm william and i'm kristen we're a husband wife dynamic duo co-founders of uprising food from cincinnati ohio we're here today seeking 500 000 for three percent equity in our company hello sharks we want to revolutionize health and it starts with bread we teamed up with the best artisan bakers in the industry to bring you the healthiest tastiest most powerful bread in the game and did we mention our bread also known as the uprising cube is keto paleo and boosts gut health that's right and it's dairy and gluten free some say it even tastes like it's straight out of heaven we've truly done the impossible our cubes are packed with fiber and created with clean and boosted superfood ingredients now who wants to join our health revolution and bring this mouth-watering taste like heaven bread to the masses now who wants to taste heaven here so what we have today is for you to experience live the uprising grilled cheese we also have french toast and this is just a plain piece of the bread right yes exactly i'm gonna try that too go ahead jump right in so we didn't just stop at bread we also created chips and yes we have sales on both we are brand builders through and through i worked at procter gamble and kristin works at another cpg company it's important to us that we bring an aesthetic and an inspiration to our brand building efforts it's got a little bit of a sponginess to it almost like a cake it's chewy it's really chewy exactly what and what is that so that is designed on purpose because we want you to have a very specific mouth feel with this bread this lasts one to four weeks in the fridge yes yes that's amazing and that's with no preservatives i'm going to give you a little credit for the taste because i've tried a lot of these products and they taste like utter the bread this is pretty good what does this cost how much that goes for 12 right there whoa whoa yes for a little loaf of bread like that yes there's a lot of power in that guys i think the bread tastes absolutely delicious but i just can't get over the price like 12 bucks for this tiny little like half a loaf of bread how does that compare in the market like i want to find a five dollar bill in the bread you know i don't understand that uh this is not a basic bread we're looking to upgrade bread americans are quite frankly getting sick because of the foods that were industrialized and scaled my father is the type of person who represents the masses now he's an annuity for the medical system he was given four weeks to live we intervened with food and my dad is still here today when we think about what we're doing here it's not about us being successful it's about the mission of helping people and we will drive success by solving this problem for society so i agree with everything you're saying and i totally agree about the disease factor my dad died from that basically same issue irish guy lots of starch lots of white flour killed them but not everybody in america can afford for eight slices twelve dollars that's really expensive yeah exactly what are the revenues of this business so first year in business 2019 we did 85k top line second year in business 2020 the pandemic hits we did just under a million top line how's that possible what did you do well hold on it gets better it gets better first six months of 2021 2.1 million year to date pretty good i almost want to ask you for proof [Music] we're experts at digital marketing so right now we can deliver a consumer for just under fifty dollar customer acquisition costs yeah that is a lot for what you sell because you need a lifetime customer to overcome that initial yeah bingo it would be a lot if we weren't in such a high frequency consumer let's get to grips with these numbers because the sales last year were really impressive but what's your profit we are not cashflow positive yet we have uh just under a million in net losses sorry last year yes we sell ate one loaf for 12 that cost us five dollars and 25 cents to make let's talk shipping once you take that down for shipping we clear about a thirty percent margin once you average our bundles together and you make about three dollars and sixty cents per loaf yup five hundred thousand for three percent computes a sixteen point six million dollar valuation explain why you're worth 16.6 million dollars okay we're on track to do 5 million this year as you've heard we've done 2.1 million year-to-date other companies like us we believe can get a 6x multiple in market but you don't make money yet are you saying you're gonna make money if you hit five million this year no no absolutely not so when do you become profitable ever uh we we will become profitable when we reach a certain level of schedules you will become profitable when you reach a certain level of scale our goal is to drive top line revenue what is your exit strategy yeah we would like to either exit the company to a larger multinational or we could foresee taking this company public at some point i don't think i've ever sat and spent this time in my seat and heard more fancy words in my entire life right okay i think if i were to put any money into your business i would not sleep a wink tonight wow okay it's not even a business so that i'm listening about it's a cause the uprising the battle has begun but the bottom line here is i don't trust you to even protect my money and sadly for me that's the reason i'm out let me tell you just a quick thing here here's i want to share a few things with you i like the concept of healthier foods right and i do think that down the road it will have great potential because this is on trend for what people want but sadly it's also too big and ask for me your valuation so i'm sorry i'm out okay thank you laura thank you i'm stuck as an investor on this 500 000 for three percent for this deal to work you're gonna have to exit at close to half a billion valuation for me to get my money back okay thank you guys i think the product is great you know i consider myself a foodie and definitely a bread girl and i thought this bread was really really great but equally i think that the you know the sign of a really good entrepreneur is to really know the climate that you're in and i think for you know so many years now those of us that are in direct to consumer businesses have really been able to scale our businesses and do exactly what you guys said you were going to do chase the top line without real consideration for becoming a profitable business you guys did not come in and demonstrate what your path to profitability is good point you missed it you spoke about all of your order economics which ain't that great by the way because you're paying too much to acquire the customer and as everybody said you're not profitable on your first customers so i think for me you know i'm out thank you yeah guys look so why don't you run the company to be profitable now why didn't you go after being profitable by the month to to be able to sustain all this that's actually exactly what we did mark we lost a million dollars the journey to get here we aggressively drove cac to the floor we've been the number one lowest cac in the such a nonsense [Music] you start small you got a nice little product and whatever you do you go door-to-door you go online you sell it locally and you make money and you grow but now your back is really against the wall right because you're losing money on every sale so the more customers you acquire the more money you lose unless you can make sure that you're selling them a whole lot more products and your products are expensive and you know the bread on slice you get it and it's like what do i do now you know you know take a bite out of it that crust is actually very important to preserving the product people buy that product for the trifecta of three reasons you can't find something this healthy that tastes this good that's this fresh then why don't you say that why don't you say that because you say that was the best thing you said all day exactly so that was the best sales that you've made the packaging that you're looking at there is unfortunately our gen 2 packaging before we really dialed in that positioning statement and figured out that was the winning concept you're driving me nuts okay we are constantly okay right you're over selling with all the jargon when you have an authentically good product right your whole little speech on crust is everything you should be saying and just selling this just because of that i want a product that's going to give me all these things that i can't get from a sliced product that's all you had to say so simplify focus on the product and amount thank you guys so much good luck thank you thank you i honestly think the sharks are out of their minds i question what they ate this morning we know that our product is changing people's health and they couldn't see that i'm not sure what's wrong with them you ", "Wisp": "[Music] next into the tank is an innovation for a common household [Music] tool hello sharks my name is Evan Dobson founder of wisp Industries and I want to introduce you to the Wisp a revolutionary floor cleaning system that's in the process of disrupting a category that hasn't changed in centuries sweeping we have literally re-engineered the Brom and the dustpan from the bristles up making for a more efficient and unique action We call wisping we all know what it's like to use an old broom and a dust pan it requires two hands in a side by side motion to use the pan you got to bend down it's true it's pain putting strain on your back and your knees and we all know what it takes to get that last pesky line of debris well no more the Wisp is intentionally lightweight to be used with one hand in a pulling motion the bristles are short dense and 90\u00b0 to the floor to create a perfect seal to that surface the patented whis pan is amazing it literally allows you to apply pressure with your foot simply step on the back here and see how that creates that perfect seal allowing you to easily bring in that debris effortlessly that's smart on the side of the pan are Combs that allow you to clean that bristle wow the evolution of sweep keeping is wisping that's why we're seeking $500,000 for 10% of the company so come on sharks lot ofis who wants to join team whisp right now and make sweeping changes all across the world have you sold any of these things yes we sold over 100,000 units today we've done over 3.3 million in sales lifetime wow is any of this protected or all of it everything you look at has a design patent and Utility Patent as well so what was your profit last year did not have a profit last year we had a loss due to two very significant events where it Aid into our margin we were on a couple shows where we had to do Revenue share there was an inherent marketing cost to reach that many eyeballs so you offer your product at half price it's 50% off to the customer so basically if you have a 50% markup on your product you make no money but you get a lot of eyes on your product we sold 20,000 units in 4 hours but at no profit very little but what about the rest of the year what was your sales last year 1.43 and you made no money on that we lost 600,000 go lost how' you do that that's hard to do there was a lot of decisions that I made and I take full responsibility for it I had many people that were on um a consistent kind of compensation schedules and I learned that that was when times were lean that that was a bad decision on my half and I've made those changes like sales reps and distributor type things yeah and people that market Ean how much have you invested and how much have you raised I've raised uh close $2.5 million over 6 years the golf doing this 6 years wow so we don't even know what does one cost and what does it cost to make the configuration you're looking at right here cost $29.95 and our cost of goods in 17 were $8.50 so the problem is you're competing with an $8.99 broom yes and how much do you have in inventory there we have about $300,000 why did you buy so much inventory in 2016 we went viral to over 110 million views and we sold out like that so instantaneously I went we need more inventory we brought it in CAU up because it took time all of our search and exposure started dissipating and we had to start that back up again so we did another event and we keep doing this roller coaster what we're looking at with your help would be to bring in a more consistent economical way to create a supply chain and then really go after what we believe is our online Edge okay so what are you cumulative losses since the beginning of inception like what how much have you lost in these years total we raised 2.5 is that mean you've lost 2.5 you have any money left we have about $50,000 okay so you have $50,000 in the bank $300,000 in inventory some IP but but effectively you're down $2 million more 2.1 million in the [Music] whole all sharks are still in but they've discovered that eban is over $2 million in debt for his broom business wisp effectively you're down $2 million more 2.1 million in the hole well I don't believe I'm doing a really good job of painting the exact picture because um we we know that the products will sell and what I'm here for is to is to I've made mistakes and I I think you get a a for effort and a f for execution and I think you know that and so for those Reasons I'm out look the product clearly works I mean that's the Intriguing part but in year after year after year you've made made no money that's very depressing and so the question is do you need adult supervision so that you get focused on one thing cuz there must be somebody that wants a broom that works it's just how do you find them it's why I'm here it's why I'm here because I've been punched for three plus years and and um I've been working off instinct to go uh and optimize um cost of goods but where did you raise a 2.5 million from well from U my network uh and nobody has come in since then saying what the hell's going on well um let me take over let me give you some I never raised enough money to really drive the business I always did it Project based and it's been a long time coming we did a 2.5 million do each one of us started hundred million plus businesses with thousands of dollars look we all make mistakes as entrepreneurs but I just really don't think you have your act together on this for those Reasons I'm out okay so sorry about that eban I have this Theory when you're first starting a business make it sell it make it sell it I feel like you spend a lot more money maybe than you needed to and I would take a hard look at that one of the things that I say to people is as soon as you can afford to hire your weaknesses your contribution to this feels like it should be more in the product side MH and I would encourage you to get support on the Marketing sales side so that you can really focus on the part of the business that I can feel is your strength okay and I like your product I'm going to buy your product actually but I'm not going to invest in your company today so I'm out thank you Innovation requires education Evan it's a great product it needs to be demonstrated it's been a very Rocky Road you certainly need a partner to be your mirror image and do all the things you don't do well you have some weaknesses in executional skills when it comes to business not everybody does it well that's why they partner mhm you desperately need a partner someone with executional skills and certain disciplines about how money is spent that person's Mr Wonderful so if you want $500,000 I'll do it but I want 50% not 51 50 cuz that's a lot of money I don't like losing $500,000 I don't do that ever do you have debt on the company too very little comparatively how much 250,000 oh I knew that was going this story gets longer well I don't I don't know if you can sell me 50% of the company who owns it well I have a I have a 22 investors wow that have been through 22 Yeah it's been a long road of oh I feel like I'm at of wake honestly I don't think I've ever sat here where I felt like something took my breath away oh my goodness I mean I just was like w it's like a punch to the gut you have so much debt and you've lost so much money what are you going to do how do you recommend I get out of thiss and fight for it I mean there's got to be a chance you need somebody who who's a just a killer salesperson you know I I've had every opportunity to quit from all of the things that we're talking about but I believe in it so strongly and I'm so passionate I own a basketball team and I'm smart hard enough not to put myself on the court I can't wrap my arms around so much debt it's so bad if you can get Kevin to invest all the money I will help him and you to sell it you put up the money I'll do the Sal you want to put up 250,000 no you put up the money call you later after I my sleeves and I'll do the Sal that's something we can deal with later look Evan I'll put up the $500,000 but one way or another I'm ending up as a 50/50 partner now if you're 22 investors don't like that outcome they don't like it because they're not here but you are so I'm going to make you that offer if you're willing to accept it let's go to work there's a lot of he's not interested in doing anything to bring me in to help you sell it l i can discuss that later she's out okay look maybe we'll work with Lori later but right now you need $500,000 she's not willing to put up a scent I am I'll put up the 500,000 but I got to end up with 50% yes or no Evan what do you want to do but why wouldn't you not want to include I might but she's not putting up any money right now so I'm not worried about it I think you need me Evan if you want to do a deal with Lori do a deal with Lori she has no money for this deal what do you want to do this is your moment yes or no okay we'll do it wow here you go wow but but but wa what did I hear a butt but wait there's more I'll lose her number remember he did not include me so now you I know her number I can call her anytime I want her if I need her and she'll come run maybe maybe not well do you have anything that we could you could add I really I'm out get out of there I'm gone I'm an investor okay I had the 500 it was in your hand and you're talking to her you're out of here see you buddy goodbye take the bye Evan Kevin's offer was amazing but I don't believe that I had the ability to make that decision that quickly that could have gone better but the truth of the matter is is that I'm not going anywhere the Wisp is still going to be available now he's made three mistakes to the next potential inv that was too tough are you out of your mind that was too tough for that man I'm going up there to shake his hand and he's still talking you know why too mean I feel terrible no he's not a businessman wait wait let me [Music] cry for ", "Pavlok": "[Applause] next up is a unique way to break bad habits [Music] hi sharks my name is manish sethi and i'm from boston massachusetts and i'm seeking 500 000 in exchange for 3.14 of my company three point one it's pi day sharks everybody has bad habits and for some of us they're minor nail biting hitting the snooze button but for others they can be much more serious or even deadly meet pavlok the first wearable that doesn't just track what you do but actually changes what you do padlock helps you become aware by alerting you when you do behaviors you'd like to reduce and simply press the button and pavlock releases a mild electric sensation that helps you reduce cravings you can laugh but it's actually something very serious i am laughing it releases a mild electric sensation that helps you reduce cravings and actually breaks bad habits in the brain pavlok harnesses scientific methods that have been researched for decades but it's not just research since launch our users have had incredible success in changing their behaviors now sharks which of you wants to join us in our mission to help people across the globe take control of their own behavior how did you come up with this idea i've always had severe atd i could never get myself to actually get stuff done i couldn't get myself to commit to anything so i did what any normal person would do i hired someone to sit down next to me and slap me in the face every time i went on facebook and i wrote a blog post about it seriously yeah it's cool video and the blog post went insanely viral did they actually slide yeah this video of me getting slapped but did you get the work done i did yeah it was really cool stuff yeah what made you come up with this idea yeah i was visiting a friend of mine i'm like dude why are we why am i paying i could just make a make a zapper that zaps every time i go on facebook [Music] after one moment um i just want to explain kind of the science behind it and then i'll bring it out for you padlock uses a type of science called aversive conditioning it was very common in the 1960s it's a slight electric stimulus that's done while doing a undesired bad habit and it very rapidly trains your reptile brain to associate that uncomfortable stimulus with the bad habit this is based on the problem principle can you explain that principle to us sure so when you add two stimuli together at the same time your brain doesn't know what is causing the stimuli to occur it just knows that they're both happening at the same time and it starts to retreat so i'll go ahead and bring it out for you right now to try on there you go mr herchevec this one yeah please put it on for me it's got your name engraved on it and everything wow i like the design of that thank you and actually you notice mr cube thank you sir i simply press the lightning bolt on the top of it press down hard oh there you go it's just a little pulse yeah so i set it low for you because i didn't want everybody to get scared can you search it higher yeah i'll do right now all right oh get out turn it back turn it down wow how do you turn it i really feel it but let me come back to our results okay okay in a study that we based our first experiment with it was a aversive conditioning study that was done in 1988 with 832 subjects so okay so wait so wait let's let's qualify for five you said we based our first study on right suggesting that sure that you did the study right so i'll tell you about a study we did right after but you can actually look through our evidence pamphlet where we have 21 clinical trials i bite my nails i'm trying to not bite my nails all the time where it falls down for me is if i have the discipline to buzz myself do i not have the discipline to stop people okay people do you have a discipline to stop well i don't do you wish you could stop i do so can i so here's your premises robert it's all nonsense across the board just i can't get around that like i'm just i want to bite my nails and for me to stop i have to hit this thing sure why can't laurie buzz it for me she can't i'm she absolutely can there's a remote control there's a uh there's a remote control app there's automation what percentage of time does it not work uh it doesn't work if you don't want it to work so it does oh wow yeah of course so if you use it on sugar after about three or four days on like a cookie or tortilla chips you'll start to notice the flavor changes now what's interesting about it in the first doctor knows it's the flavor changes yeah you're such a con artist i'm absolutely not as for results mark more than 50 percent of our users break their habit in five days or less first of all first of all okay let me give you the want to get a deal skepticism to me why you're worth 14 million dollars 15. 50. what is it how much number one number one our sales are great what are you doing what are your sales and we actually just began shipping this week we've sold 800 000 of revenue wait wait pre-orders three-fourths of the users were pre-orders and one-fourth of the users were prototypes what did each of those people pay for one device 200 how much 200 who buys these so our biggest users are sitting too long waking up on time nail biting and eating so we've started to build out multiple really cool integrations for this product the first thing is the alarm clock it's the first alarm clock that works you get when you get a slight zap in the morning it actually knocks you away with a life of adrenaline great way to start the day yeah you'd be surprised that people love it how could you guys be so gullible read the evidence it's none of it's yours no one's disputing aversion therapy yeah so we're conversion therapy we're bringing aversion therapy together you can't be that stupid robert do you even think there's any legitimacy calm down oh my gosh you guys are making me so eddy all right let me talk about we make you a dc's make it happen all right denise you're a strange dude some of the cool stuff we're doing that mr cuban would like is this we've uh i don't think mark's gonna like anything yeah virgin therapy is legit but what's not legit is trying to take credit for other studies and apply it to your products [Music] with all the citations sir you got a booklet none of those studies are just related these are studies these are aversion therapies version therapy studies so okay outside your realm not necessarily that's the strongest point here is that this isn't based on anything that you've done right are you negotiating okay so we have had well your studies quit their addiction and fight in five days seven days or less but you don't have any proof that it changes more than half of our users quit more than 81 percent of our users quit nail-biting in four days where is your proof of this what study do you have you should be doing clinical trials right so why don't you have clinical trials all right i'm gonna make it simple i talk about things i say things are either heroes or zeros for me this is a nowhere nero i'm out i find your presentation is exhausting and complicated and i couldn't imagine having the energy to deal with this doesn't sound very positive barbara i'm out okay lori barbara history i'd like to talk a little bit about our numbers this year let me just finish sure when you first came out i really liked it it's happened habit creates discipline discipline creates more habit and that's how you get success what i don't like about is you have a 16 million dollar valuation on pre-orders it's too much i'm out so i understand absolutely robert thank you very much look if you had verifiable proof that all your aversion therapy can be well executed with your device you wouldn't need to import other people's studies because with all this advanced money you got you could have gone to any university and said you know what we don't want to rush it we want to get our own verifiable studies in place so that no one can question us the one thing that kills tech products is hyperbole because at some point you have to execute you violated listen to me now your turn to listen if you would have just said you know what this is a reminder and everybody is different so we have different ways to remind you right but you went so over the top with nonsense it is everything but a legitimate product and for those reasons i'm out let me tell you like what let me let me come back to you guys i really want to answer the question there is a medical component to this but shock yourself for a minute you're a combination of spontaneous combustion and add mixed together i'm not kidding it's very difficult to listen to you yeah luckily for you i got my undergrad in psychology to make money i worked on a rhesus study that used the same technology how many other degrees right and i'm telling you the truth here so i'm interested okay [Music] [Music] four sharks are out but kevin seems interested in manisha's habit-breaking watch pavlok i believe this technology works because i've seen it work your valuation is crazy okay i'm sorry it's not worth 50.9 million now i'm going to solve the problem in the deal structure i'm very creative i'll give you the 500 000 as debt on the home okay you're going to give me the 3.14 percent as equity today and you're going to walk out of here with a shark tank here i'm going to put it on for 24 months at seven and a half percent and balloon payment be back in two years if one third of projections are right you can easily do that it's an offer it's an offer this is the problem um damn there's a there's no problem so the problem mr wonderful is that it's we're not focused on the money we're focused more on focused on the money you've come to the wrong place my friend i'm here to make money let it finish kev our biggest thing our biggest goal is to break bad habits around the world and mr wonderful like i just i i can't work with you why not i'm just worried that if we work together like him i do like him as a person but i feel like as an investor in the company would be really bad manish you didn't want an offer here today you really want an offer you got one and why don't you want the structure of that offer the structure is actually quite good uh what's the person it's the person i feel like i would take an offer from anybody besides mr wonderful manish you already get them out of here oh um okay well if you are you all out yeah we're all left done monies all right thank you very much [Music] i have a tinge of regret for rejecting the deal with mr wonderful but the truth is our company is building something much bigger than just money we're trying to change human behavior and kevin wouldn't be the right partner for us to work with you ", "No Mo-Stache": "first into the tank is a product that comes to the aid of hairy situations [Music] hi sharks my name is jennifer and i'm guitar we're

ready to get in with smooth skin i need to ask you i need to ask a very very important question you get that extra hair why don't you just shave like the rest of us oh no you know you take a little razor you go and it's gone it would grow it would grow in it would grow and you'd have a chia pet on your lips by a week from tuesday no then you don't know excuse my ignorance is this that big a problem is there that many women that have mustaches oh my god everybody has everybody reality let me ask you a question though what's the difference of the sally hansen strips perfect you carry them in your purse uh you could carry it in your purse and somebody could see it when you open up your bag and then they'll be like girl why do you have the styling hand sorry i don't know what a sally hansen strip is it's the waxing people they have a business of what hair removal a bunch of people do so this is a tin the concept here is discretion this is a tin it's like putting a tampon in a single nothing proprietary about this it is the only portable waxing kit on the market is it patented in some way no no you can't so what are you bringing here what do you got for them no idea it's poor it's portable i have 14 years of waxing experience at the estheticians 400 000. right tell us what it costs you to make what you sell it for where you sell it and how much you've sold um our cost of goods is 174 landed the whole kit the whole kit sent here um we've done four hundred thousand dollars of sale there you go in two years yeah how much this year are you going to do 350 000 this year what does it sell for i'm sorry it's 18 retail that's not one little tin is 18 dollars wow so there you go bethany listen i i really do think this is a gimmick it's what you buy on the way out of like the lingerie it's a four hundred thousand dollar gimmick so where are you selling it so we're currently selling uh at sephora we're in the check out beauty on the go and the bins the impulse that's beautiful yes how did you get in there so we got our product in real simple magazine and then one day our email just kept going bonkers and i'm like what is going on and just order after order afterwards there's nothing proprietary what's saying but you know what convenience sell there's nothing proprietary about water either are you in every sephora no we're in 60 sephora 60. yeah how many are there total remind me 200 can you get the other thing they haven't taken you into the others originally we were in the other stores in 200 stores and now we're in 60 stores okay so so the sales weren't good in some of those actually that's not true every single week the sales were consistent they wanted to bring up make room for new trends that happens right they roll through yeah so that's that's a little bit of a concern because this may not be really well they would have kept it right right but it's hard to defend the fact that you lost 140 stores that's what basically happened right but i've had so many products that have gone into at all doors and then they do take it down why that tell me why that's exciting news well what's exciting news is that since then we have been pushing the pedal to the metal to not have all of our eggs in one basket exactly that's it so basically it's a marketing play on an old commodity and you've done a good job in getting some shelf space for it hopefully you're gonna diversify your sales outside of just one distributor yes we are launching with uh five more distributors in september oh it came up it did i want to say something positive i just waxed mark's arm which i never thought i'd say so all the competitors that i have used in the past they are very sticky they get gluey they get all over everything they're still on there later and you're feeling it i just waxed his arm and it's very neat now that mark has been waxed that changes everything so i'm gonna make you an offer you ready you're asking a hundred thousand dollars for 25 you're very lucky to be here today i might say that too because i'm willing to give you the hundred thousand dollars for ten percent okay but the way you're going to pay me back is i'm going to get a dollar a lip that's the way i like to look at it every time you sell one of these excuse me silence while i get the offer out i'm gonna give you a hundred thousand dollars for ten percent equity but every time you sell one of these i get a dollar until i receive three hundred thousand dollars back and then it goes away i don't normally say this it's a great out of bad option it actually is a great offer here's the thing i have thought about you're very attached to the name i think it very much limits you to only hair removal and i've thought that there needs to be a kit for women that has nipple covers your sticky tape your hair removal thing this is one little gimmick no disrespect this is going to go away large is the nipple cover mark the nipple i have a female audience i have thought that places like sephora need a girl's kit a whole kit with all of these things so i need to own that marker you're asking a hundred thousand for 25 i would give you a hundred thousand for for forty percent oh fashion and beauty of a kit for women a skinny girl solutions kit this is one little product i i there's a million types of hair removal you're going to be dead in the water you had one retailer and you ready reduced by 140 stuff you have to rebrand it under bethany [Music] all sharks are still in jennifer and gita have two offers on the table from kevin and bethany for their hair removal kit no mo stash but bethany's offer would require them to rebrand their product under bethany's skinnygirl brand ladies do you want to go down that direction do you want to give up your company under her brand you don't want to build somebody else's business you do not you're not you have a great idea here i don't think that's a bad idea actually whoa it's a very competitive space come in with me no one has put it together in a compact way you're going away for a girls weekend you're going to a wedding you don't know what's going to happen not until you get dressed you're like dressed down yes you have mates to help a woman in a pinch what are you doing trying to like this idea because i think that we could sell it me too so where where where were you at a hundred thousand for forty percent yes oh savage that and is allowed to counter i mean you're allowed don't do that you've got us though to power jennifer let me ask you a question i just want to be clear bethany's offer is she wants to rebrand your company under her company or what laurie and i decide together for partners i don't have the problem with the individual items names i think they're cute good point that that excuse should be have that name and the other two and no more bad breath or whatever you want to come up with no more whatever but the whole kit is called something that we come up with so don't mow everything listen ladies no moustache no more mark i'm out i can get access to a chihuahua with no hair and we can stick it right on the tin we won't pay anything wait hold on jennifer okay i'm changing something we could call the whole brand no mo but it's no more and you figure out what all the problems are no more nipple no more pants no more pants as much as profit is genderless i just feel like it's a brand to empower women and i feel like you guys get the vision wait a minute so our counter would be then 35 two sharks 35 well you guys came in at 145 right which tells me that you really want partners what you get along with us is a lot of credibility and branding why do something i couldn't have only asked you for 10 let me make it even more interesting for you i'll drop my royalty down to 75 cents [Music] you can't get into business with him you could not pick up absolutely you do not have to give up that much what was your counter it's a lot of equity if you would be willing to do a deal where um we'd say back to the 25 equity and then there was a royalty we'd be open to that as well we we just have our hearts set okay i'm going to make it more interesting because i want to squeeze their heads a little bit i'm going to drop my royalty down to 50 cents okay not from a dollar anymore it's 50 cents and i'm only taking 10 of the company forget these guys what are you waiting for let's do the deal okay we're being creative okay we'll go to the 35 percent bethany and i hundred thousand with a one dollar royalty that's a rational split that was it's already down to fifty percent each kip of nomo everything until we get our money back and then we'll cut the royalty my deal is way better you do yes like that all too much equity if this works you've given away your company now would you be willing to go up to 200 000 in the royalties um and then go back down to 25 i'll take that deal no we'll take that deal in no more negotiating wow congrats girls thank you ladies congratulations ladies oh my god it's like our dream like we wanted these strongest women in the tent exactly what we want like oh my god i i'm freaking out you have no creativity in structuring deals you're just you're just ripping me off learn grasshopper learn i'll wax your back as a thank you you ", "Pronotbev": "next into the tank is a product that provides an ice cold beverage exactly when you want [Music] it sharks my name is Alexander Simone I'm an inventor from San Francisco I'm here today seeking $100,000 as an investment for 5% of my company Pronto Concepts my invention solves a problem that millions of wine lovers all over the world face every day wine lovers love their wine Shield they also love their wine in the moment but the best spontaneous beverage ironically requires the most preparation and foresight that's why I invented Pronto [Music] Bev behold the world's fastest wine chiller as soon as you pour any bottle into PR B the wine grade stainless steel interior jump starts a rapid heat transfer process samules or wine experts recommend that each variety of wine be chilled to its own specific temperature which truly unlocks the flavors within Pronto Bev's built-in thermometer monitors your wine so you get that perfect temperature every single time Pronto Bev can chill a bottle up to 20\u00b0 in just 30 seconds before Pronto Bev the only way to choose from your wine collection and enjoy immediately was to own a wine refrigerator well there we have it perfectly chilled wine so sharks when it comes to your wine and when it comes to your money will you be waiting around or do you need it Pronto all right all right one do you like to come up and check out the before and after version I do come on up and just to let you know um this prototype is actually not food grade but it should be safe I drink from it all the time like I said be safe is it cold Kevin it's uh Beyond chilled it's it's cold is it the right temperature it's the right temperature for a white could I have some wine please I'll be your server okay continue you Dr out of that Damon do you want a glass please thank you Mark sure why not okay thank you all right Mr John you Mr cubin so you were saying you don't have like the right one here right so is this not even in production yet it's not in production yet what's the material that holds the temperature Delta behind the stainless steel is our trade secret Pronto gel is that patented we have a provisional patent on it yes okay how did you come up with this idea I was back in college trying to drink a bottle of wine with a girl and the wine was warm so me being kind of like the inventor type I grabbed a pasta strainer I filled it with ice poured the wine through and amazingly the wine was super cold super fast and we go to drink the wine and it was just horribly disgusting when you did that you also diluted the white the so that that is a huge issue in chilling white wines this doesn't dilute it which is a good thing and I know that because I'm a member of the Chev and we care about the temperature of our wines I'll drink I'll drink that to the shimy Che okay um can you tell us where you're at with sales yes so we just finished our Indiegogo uh crowdfunding campaign yesterday and we raised $54,000 what were you looking for 25,000 and what does it cost on crowdfunding it's $89 when we're actually selling it we'll sell it for $129 cost us $22 to make so if you're positioning this product is a wine chiller basically why do we have to put it back in the bottle the way we can get it to chill so quickly it basically is like a Canon blast of cold you're saying it freezes if you leave it inside it won't freeze but the temperature will keep dropping with any alcoholic drink there's a perfect temperature and just to let you know all of the temperatures are written right on the packaging thank you very much so you seem to know a lot about wine what's your background I actually studied entrepreneurship where at at Arizona State I came up with this idea like I said I've worked for other startups in the past but I've known my entire life that I was going to do something like this so I have no idea why people aren't really going over this valuation so let's look at the crowdfunding platform you on you only sold $54,000 wor in two months the first two months do you have some other stuff that's going to give us uh a reason to get to a $2 million valuation there is another reason so one of our biggest competitors they're also a wine chiller but they take way longer and there are other drawbacks the product that prompto has a lot of advantages over what does the competition cost what does it cost they charge uh $80 they're doing how much in business 10 to 20 million a year 10 to 20 that's a big big swing but um so you believe that that's why you're worth $2 million I see our product as being worth far more than that all right you've been watching Shark Tank where did we go wrong why do you think we would ever invest in a company at this level with a $2 million valuation this company has only one direct to go and that's up well then I failed you because I obviously am not giving the right lessons here and the right information because I don't want you to go into another room and make a stupid mistake like that valuation is crazy I'm out okay one of the challenges I have them working with inventors when you're an inventor first and an entrepreneur second you want to invent but the harder part is turning into a company that's profitable enough to make it worthwhile valuing this company at $2 million I just don't don't see that I don't see it going there and so for those reasons am out oh that hurts Mar you would have been a great worker Alexander look you know a great product that you're very passionate about doesn't make a great company then your evaluation isn't trivial it's just way too soon for me I mean I I'm out but I I think the only person that would be interested would be a wine expert what do you call a wine expert a a great reason to toast [Music] okay Alexander I don't care what you think it's worth all right I know the challenges of getting into the wine business there's tons of competition and very little of it's proprietary but I see the Merit of it I would use it there's more good news I'm going to make you an offer and it's the only offer I'm going to make not going to negotiate okay you got to be kidding me I'm going to go and give you $100,000 I want 50% [Music] you know why cuz you don't know what you don't know and you really need somebody to actually endorse this and help you get it out there hey but this this Pride hold on I have some good news and some bad news what do you want first uh give me the bad news first bad news first I'm out Lori what's the good news from that I'll tell you the good news the good news is I think you have something clever and I think that it has Merit I went out because I think that there's a lot of time and education and learning and tweaking for you to get to a price point that I think will be a hero but I I do think you have the potential to get there and you have a member of the listen Alexander you do have an offer what do you want to do there's no way I have any flexibility I've been doing this my whole life and you can't give up 50% of company it's not a company discussion with Kevin Kevin if if I gave you 50% of my company it would be doomed from that moment why because I need Equity to play around with so I can give need 50% is is there a better partner than me is there 20% no I no no no no I take you out of the wastelands the darkness I bring you to the light Darkness light that's what's going to happen that's what's going to happen you have a high probability of making money versus you walk out the door with without a deal and you are so dead to me I won't even remember this thing I'm willing to negotiate but I need to keep some Equity a for myself cuz I should have the majority B so I can go and raise the other 100,000 I have interested people in other 100,000 look if you had come more advanced with sell through and proven sales that's different I would have given you more credit maybe had flexibility you have none of those things Okay Kevin are you stuck at the 50% I said at the beginning Robert I have no flex give him 200,000 or 250,000 extra 100,000 how do I raise the money Kevin if you're in my partner I this needs to happen where am I going to get the other 100,000 I get diluted too so maybe I'll go in on that route maybe I'll put more money into it now he own less than 50% it's not his company anymore that's his point River Mark yes or no Alexander and you won't budge it all cuz you're me no room here it's binary yes or no this is your moment you decide what's your next product Alexander our next product is a mar him for he's already out that that chills martinis you know the problem with the martini business is why to get into the martini side of it and to do this and get it out you need another $100,000 right how are you going to get the other 100 we have people who are interested I know I can get the other 100,000 I I'll give you $100,000 for 25% contingent that you raiseed the other 100 yeah done thank you you got a work your ass I will I will I really will all

"my name is Derek Paquet I'm 23 years old and I just graduated from the Kelly School of Business at Indiana University it has graduates such as U.S state senators CEOs of Fortune 500 companies and even Mark Cuban I got the idea for my business when I was when I was still at school hey guys the friends at a bar and it just came to me my college professor liked my ideas so much he actually decided to become an investor so this is the unit right not only is this business a great idea but Derek is a capable individual that can really take this business to Great Heights Professor Hayes knows what it takes to really get something off the ground it's going to cost half a million dollars we don't want to raise Equity capital and that that's huge Professor Hayes and I make a great team he brings a lot of experience and I bring a lot of energy I have risked a lot to turn this business into a career I've put in all my savings I've taken money from family and friends and turned down many great job offers getting a deal with the sharks is exactly what I need to turn my dream into a reality foreign Hoosiers baby Hoosier I'm the founder of coachex and I'm here today asking for two hundred thousand dollars for a 10 Equity stake in my company while attending Indiana University I recognized a dilemma that everyone faces when they go out in bad weather they either don't wear a coat and shiver or they could wear a soft warm and cozy coat but then they have to babysit it all night I wish I'd put a leash on mine because one night it was stolen while throwing down my favorite moves on the Dance Floor I was so mad that I went up to a manager and I asked them why they didn't have a coach yet they told me it was way too much of a hassle so I asked him can I open one up myself before I knew it I had two code checks set up in my college town during this time I came to realize why no one provides code checks this is the security it's just not organized or effective may I present to you our ticketless code check system with our Innovative technology we match a person's face to their belonging you simply hand over your coat and then type your name into the system and a picture is taken automatically all you do from there you just pay it's that easy there's no more dealing with tickets she can now see a picture of the person and their coat to make sure she's giving it back to the right person it is time to turn an inconvenience into an opportunity so how about one of you writes me a check and I'll check you into code checks do you have any sales no I've not made the technology we just started what's the business is the business the service or are you trying to sell the technology we're franchising we have a system now and we have equipment so that anyone can sort of do what I did so you want to sell the computer the design everything I buy the franchise that's the business model okay so Derek what is the plan to sell 100 000 of these units we're starting to get agreements with area developers right now for example in Chicago someone says to me hey I can get 50 franchises open I'm willing to put down 150 000 to start off in equipment to get this out there so wait let me get this straight you have not sold any of these yet nope you haven't had a chance to test it right yeah and you're going out and you're selling franchises to area developers who are then a good intern go and sell them to franchisees exactly horrible horrible horrible idea let me ask you something how do you really feel about it horrible because you haven't tested anybody who's done anything in technology knows that the only certainty is that it's going to screw up Derek why don't you go to the busiest Steakhouse near where you live and say to the person there that owns it let me install this for free you've got 500 coats coming in here every night let me watch it work for 90 days why wouldn't you do that I want to it's just too warm right now in Indianapolis [Laughter] I love it love it so seasonal how many of those coats did you steal yourself you're asking for ten percent for two hundred thousand dollars right yes I know so for two million dollars that you're evaluating your company at you are the let me tell you why I'm evaluing it I'm so fascinated I would love to hear why we have a patent on articulous bailment system bailment failment it's whenever you hand over belonging to someone and they keep it for a certain period of time give me another example Valet dry cleaning rental services um any kind of baggage holding Services you have a patent on all of that yes that's that's interesting but you're not investing in just coach X we want to get this into all the different bailment situations you're just in the development stage exactly what's the whole Capital cost to put all this together we were going to sell for 1500. walk us through the money how much you charge to check a code anywhere from two to five dollars depending on the scale of the event how do you pay the people that own the venue Revenue split we gained 15 of Revenue one five are there any other competitors out there like this nothing like this at all I know a little bit about the space and unfortunately I think you're incorrect there are similar products I don't think you're educated enough in the space but I think you have a lot of Drive I'm out you don't have a a plan for distribution and sales which is the greatest challenge you can only sell this six months to the year it's a seasonal sale summer comes along and nobody cares I hate seasonal businesses and for that reason Derek I'm out struck me like it takes entirely too long to check in a code what we're going to do is essentially it's gonna be an iPhone app you just come up scan your QR code I think it's easy to get a ticket and run up so there's let's take stock of where we're at right okay we've got three sharks out on either end or two that are still in I'd ignore the guys in the middle start working on trying to get some money out of these people okay well I'd like to say one thing I'm just out of college this is why I'm here I'm trying to figure out the best ways to scale this one of my partners is my professor who did venture capital and entrepreneurial Finance you know Derek I like the idea you can go to universities and other venues you franchise it down the road and that becomes part of the proprietary Advantage is you lock those venues down so you do a multi-year contract with dance halls sports bars and places like that you see and then you hire a couple guys to try to pitch it to dry cleaners or places like that but it's worth two million dollars Robert I I can't get to the 2 million help me out there I'm willing to negotiate you know that's all you think you got to start High I mean come on let's be real here and at this you know I'll take more money let's talk let's talk numbers you will take more money I want to be clear on that Robert I don't know a guy in the hood I know a guy in Beverly Hills it'll go around hanging your coats for two million dollars Mark where are you at with this I like it but I need to know more about you okay okay so you walk in the door and I'm telling you your business plan is for eign there's going to be hard decisions to make are you the type of person that you'll do the right thing and you'll make the hard decisions that's what I want to know yes but I'm all open to listening to people who have been there before so Derek I love this I just make me another offer under 2 million I can't get to a 2 million um uh I asked for 200 000 because it's it's a start it's going to get me to commercialization he asked you a very very simple question [Music] okay um two thousand dollars let's start talking 1.5 mil evaluation does that work what would that be a 15 I'll start talking one point we went from 10 to 15 his company is now 1.5 million Robert zero sales I'm out and then there was just one left let's take a step back [Music] makes perfect sense in my mind particularly since you haven't tested it or really have a track record yet to build X number of these things and take them where we can create a track record because once you've created a track record in any business your leverage and your value goes like this I've been doing that my entire adult life but you need the help I do and so this isn't a partnership that's just about cash your issue is knowledge and experience yes so I'm going to make you an offer and you can say yes or no very quickly because I don't mess around the offer is two hundred thousand dollars for 33 percent because are you crazy relax this is a great offer love the offer you're ruining the tank by giving this kind of money away can't talk to my business partner about this go ahead and call your business call me real quick real quick thank you so much well Mark you just gave him a 600 000 valuation honestly if it does what it says it does I could flip it in Silicon Valley in about 15 seconds Jerry so we got an offer for Mark 200 000 for 33 honestly he threw out a great um pinch on his part for why he's going to help us get out there you know we haven't proven anything we're here really early everyone else is going crazy that he's giving this offer I think you're giving away a lot of equity this early in the game I would pass I wouldn't I wouldn't do it and what we haven't discussed yet is that YouTube big cities where they caught where they charge 10 15 20 for code check Mark you value the company 600 000 you're just oiling the Shark Tank kids don't do this Pittsburgh you're from Pittsburgh don't be a foolish man I would love to work with you let me let me finish let me finish you guys are right I came here too early I want to prove to you guys that this is a business that I could really turn into a two million dollar question what are you saying you have an offer are you taking it or not I don't be a Hoosier bozo for right now that is the valuation of the company I think I should continue to develop it a little bit more I need to prove it to you you're turning down almost a quarter million dollars from Mark Cuban unbelievable there's companies out there that are valuing this at over 1.5 million but they're not writing a check they're not giving you any more than the answer yes or no slow down and think about it Derek everybody checked out on your valuation two million 1.5 million you're basically have an experiment no disrespect to you [Music] I have other people involved who are telling you now counter they are telling me no counter uh do you know how few people get what you have right now in your hand in Shark Tank practically nobody's answer I get it well he has nothing right now let him answer two hundred thousand dollars for twenty percent no wow admire the guts thanks guys for your time unbelievable now I've seen everything I'm in dead shock that I just turned down a deal from our Cube and it's I still to this moment don't know before you go don't forget to subscribe to the Shark Tank Youtube channel and click on that notification Bell to keep up with everything that's bubbling

is Kyle bird I'm head of product and a co-founder at Amber sharks today we are raising $200,000 in exchange for 20% stake within Amber sharks how many times You' been at an airport and had your phone tragically Die In Your Arms you know our pain all too well the fact is we didn't want to walk around with chargers in our pockets or give our phones to bartenders to charge our phones in a public space we saw a problem and we came up with a solution shark's Amber is a mobile phone charging station that is completely free to use we secure your device in one of our seven compartments using biometric scanning namely fingerprint scanning we made it super super simple let's show you how it works simply walk up scan their fingerprint choose one of the available compartments and whenever they're done they simply rescan their finger and one of the doors will unlock we realized that Amber wasn't just a free secure way for people to charge their phones in a public space but could also Drive revenue for venues by keeping people around longer and heightening the overall customer experience we want to put Amber in bars restaurants gyms movie theaters Arenas really anywhere the list goes on and on sharks by securing an investment today we can make our first big push into seeing Amber and venue Across the Nation now who wants to secure deal with Amber so is the product shipping so we are pre-revenue I love that word pre-revenue we just graduated a few weeks ago from college where'd you go to school James Mass University in Virginia Bill walk me through the premise you walk into a bar sure I'm a bar owner how much are you going to charge me so we will either charge you $2,000 outright for the unit or you can lease it either on a 69th so I buy it for 2,000 that's it there's no moreeven or you get it right on your wall for $150 right there and it's it's a monthly one 50 it's a convenience for the bar but it's not something they have to have well so so actually right now people are charging their phones in bars right they're giving them the bartenders to Waites and waiters that's a liability it's like hey can I get my phone well that waiter waitress may have left gotten off work and now they have a lost phone guys you said a door locks I didn't see the door lock so the locks in here is what we're using for testing we're actually currently um sourcing our locks through Master Lock okay so there will be a door on there yes Bill have you tested a fingerprint scanner we have we test it all in the back end cuz I'm the cyber security space here's what I know about fingerprint scanners they can be very finicky except for the very very high-end ones with all du respect to you the idea of you walking up once putting your finger in there and it recognizing you and the door coming down is ludicrous we have a big security Center the fingerprint scanner that we pay for people to get into that Center was well well over 50,000 there's no way for that price point you're going to buy a fingerprint scanner that's going to work that quickly here's how it's going to work someone's going to come up they're going go once they're going to go twice they're going to go three times they're going to pull it off the wall yeah they and and this is before they've had something to drink tell us how much you've invested right because you've got to build prototypes so on our College budgets uh uh we are sitting um I think we're right around $11,000 and what does it cost you to make a unit right now we can make the unit for $1,000 with oh $1,000 this is going to end so badly that is such a bad bus what are you you're saying you're saying the cost of it to buy is $2,000 right it's it's $150 a month or $2,000 out right why would a bar pay you 2,000 when you go to the airport those guys who have the big charges they issue it for free because they want to do their advertising why wouldn't a bar put one of those free devices behind the bar I mean why does anybody really need this I think there's so many personal charging devices and actually I'm in the space right now we're creating something that is light years ahead this I'm out the cost is horrible guys I mean you've got to get this down under $100 and and that's exactly what we're trying to do um just far away right and I feel bad cuz you put in a lot of Blood Sweat and Tears wait wait no sweat and tears just blood in the water blood we've actually had a lot of interest from festivals um and say larger scale venues conventions so we actually we we developed a products like putting it on a stand um and having say 14 units look whenever you have a lot of people one of the things you don't want to do is create a reason for them to congregate in one spot waiting for something all you're doing is creating more lines and then the finger scanner someone wet someone's grimy you're at a festival it's not going to be a clean environment this is definitely not for me I'm out there's only one answer to this I have to hire you both so I can fire you this is so horrible how do you think this has any chance of surviving and working I hate this so much it's incredible it's one of the worst ideas I've ever seen I'm out I have absolutely no interest in this business I'm out so we do have competition there are a few comp there's a lot of competitors right your biggest competitor is free you've come out with an incredibly elegant solution to free look I'm out good luck thank you guys very much for time I think that was the shortest pitch it's the worst pitch that's why it's horrible I thought you put your glass there and fill it up hey he left this the cost was an issue the security was an issue I know it works we've tested it a million times I mean I would probably go rail Hersh backck in the

going to revolutionize the massage therapy industry who loves a good massage Barbara mark a truly great therapeutic massage is all about applying as much isolated pressure as possible wouldn't it be smarter to use our feet that's why I have created body walking by standing on you I am able to limit blood flow temporarily when I come off that area the blood shoots back in there like a tsunami it feels incredible I'm able to apply more pounds per square inch which causes the body to just let go I invite one of you to come over here and experience body walking Barbara please I have so much pain sitting next to this character for three years if you just turn your head to one side or the other whatever's comfortable Todd please step on her head Mr Wonderful stress is leaving your body are you using full force Todd seconds of compression it's all about listening to Barbara's body Todd how much do you weigh I weigh 190 sir so you're putting 190 pounds on her leg Barb how does that feel I mean he is not a small guy [Music] Barb Rigamortis is starting to set in can you please let Barbara up how are you doing down there she's alive oh my God that was great I'm in contact with the biggest Massage Therapy Clinic provider in the U.S 710 Outlets one certified body Walker in there 1500 ahead that's what you charge to get certified fifteen hundred dollars yes sir Todd hang on people walk on other people's back for a massage for a long time it's not new obviously they've been doing it in Asia for thousands of years but it's a new angle for Americans is that what you're saying yes how many certified body Walkers do you have 30. how long did it take you to enlist those 30. I've been doing certifying body walking since 2005. so you're saying you basically uh did 30 people seven years in seven years yes four people here yes it's not sounding great Todd I understand Robert that's why I'm here the bottom line is it works as a 20-time Iron Man triathlete I would not be here unless it was for body walking but Todd I can't send you all over America doing massages rexer that's why if we have 10 classes a month 10 just 10. and we have 20 people in those classes that's revenue of three hundred thousand dollars when was the last time you ran a triathlon almost nine months ago and how much training do you need to do before you go into a triathlon you're training every day which is your passion Mark I've been thinking about that question all freaking season because I love your questions my passion is to generate your return on this investment quicker than anybody's ever done you haven't given me an answer Todd everybody likes to talk about following their passions when in reality they should be following their efforts just the time you put into the triathlon it's time that could be spent selling creating new certifications it tells me that my money and your money is not your primary focus Mark that's not fair it is fair because that's crazy I understand you think Triathlon is as gargantuous thing that you have to do all the time it's what keeps me happy you make choices I had my first company I went seven years without a vacation my girlfriends well my girlfriend says if you speak or your company my answer was what was your name again come on yeah I had my first visit I went seven years without food but it doesn't matter the choice is to distribute your effort among multiple things I hear you but if I'm not healthy I'm gonna get overweight I'm gonna be a problem to this country I'm not interested in investing in Balance I'm interested in investing somebody who's sole focus is to be a success at their business and I don't see that in you so come out to tell you something I am the queen of massages and I really with all due respect do not find this unique in any way I am out I don't see anything proprietary I mean look goes back to the numbers the potential potential is not sales time that market is 40 000 potential is not sales I'm out I don't think you've done a good job of telling us what the plan is here today you haven't proven the model to sell a product so for that reason I gotta walk I'm out very simple man I just want to make money I'll listen to anybody buddies Hill I get to a point where I realize I can't make any money and that's where I'm at now with you so for that reason Mr Wonderful therapist run up to me and thank me world-class athletes it's all about Todd you're a dead man walking to me I'm out okay thank you very much good luck talking all the best I guarantee once America experiences body walking they will run to their massage therapist and yell become a certified body Walker ", "Rolodoc": "[Music] next up are two doctors from Tucson Arizona with an idea to innovate communication in the medical field [Music] hi I'm Dr amini and I'm Dr amini we're brothers and we're both Physicians I'm Richard and I'm Albert our company is rollerdoc and we're seeking fifty thousand dollars for twenty percent of our company and as Physicians we're constantly communicating with our peers our patients and with other medical professionals and what we've realized is that when it comes to communication medicine is not in the 21st century I mean for crying out loud we're still using pagers to communicate what is this the 80s rolodoc is the cure for the old school communication that exists in medicine rolock allows for secure email between patients Physicians and other medical professionals the mobile app that allows for instant messaging between them take a look at this sample patient profile here's Mr Wonderful's page he's entered in his information including his medical problems he looks good looks like he's suffering from a heart condition a cardio for those non-medical nerds this is a condition when a person is literally born without a heart not to worry Mr Wonderful because you can then search for Physicians by State Specialty or insurance provider let's pick surgery choosing surgery in Arizona lets you find this young good-looking surgeon you can then view his profile and send him a message the surgeon receives the message instantly and can reply at his convenience sharks with your investment we will revolutionize the way we communicate in medicine but most importantly you'll help us get rid of these pagers and make some money doing it is the point that you can personally communicate to the doctors that you have online because doctors could be inundated with emails and personal messages how would they ever keep up with it what we're really trying to do is bring social media and the social network to the medical profession what's the social element you didn't really see so you let's say let's say Kevin O'Leary moves to La wants to find a plastic surgeon there get even sexier than he is already I don't need that looks fantastic even sexier I'm gonna have a heart attack if he wants to go find a doctor right now he's gonna do a search engine he's gonna be inundated with inaccurate information and he's really going to be end up just as confused as when he started are you up and running at all we are in Alpha Testing right now we've got 50 users on it our personal connections that are using it verifying how it works how many doctors or just total users total users I'm just looking at my own situation my doctor's in Boston when I have aches and pains and I'm on the road I can email him as I do he communicates back to me that way and suggests that I go see a specialist when I get home all done by email the organization in Boston which has my medical files shares them amongst hospitals we've got that technology now so when I arrive at the specials I have all my history they know who I am what are you adding to that equation so we're adding social media doctors want to Brand themselves want to advertise just like you create a profile on rollerdoc and it'll create a profile on another social network but those social networks aren't safe okay let's take a step back how am I going to convince you the physician to put your profile up there and detail the services that you offer well that's easy there's 800 000 us visitors I didn't ask what the market was okay there's a hundred places to put profiles what are you going to do to convince doctors just like you have business connections we have medical connections we're going to launch in Arizona Texas and Chicago connections are we we have access to multiple doctors multiple databases we're going to tell them that this is the best way to Brand yourself and how are you going to tell them I'm pulling teeth I should be a dentist are you personally going to quit your practice you're going to stop doing surgery and you're going to make the call no this day and age we can do it with electronics we can either buy a database you know what Mark get an email this is dangerous how are you vetting these doctors there's a valid concern because you don't want to be reading about somebody that actually isn't a surgeon that's offering heart surgery that would be a bad outcome I don't think they'll be able to get anybody it's going to be dangerous if you can't get any doctors okay let's go through the logical progression yeah my doctor gets an email oh it's from Roll of Doc never heard of him delete wait a second you haven't explained how I make money which is the most important thing my doctor is very hip to technology why would he use this and how would I profit from him actually getting on board he's going to use this because he's going to want to attract new patients provide social media to them okay okay he keeps on saying social media social media this is all one-to-one communication you're not going to let him tell me how I make money because there's no chance of you making money on this do is that the answer targeted advertising is it in a secure environment you can do targeted advertising ah not gonna happen well you can look there's social networks that are already doing this for physician only mobile mobile networks within just physician to physician which has a whole different set of security issues than communicating with patients correct but you can Target The Physicians I see this as a liability nightmare because you are putting people in touch with their doctors they're answering back without maybe seeing a patient knowing what's going on this just my opinion there's a lot of risk in it I'm out what we're trying to do is we're trying to bring social media to medicine and Albert let me go back tomorrow you keep saying social media then you go to email email is not social media doctors are constantly posting things on Twitter and at other websites and how do you use that well that's what we have we have the capability of being a social network instead of saying follow me on XX site you say follow me on Roll It Off I get that you're trying to recreate Twitter and Facebook onto rollodoc correct okay but I want to do this I face to face because you're doctors worst presentation ever I'm out oh that was me ever you guys should be smart enough to know you didn't show us any of the social media you showed his profiles and talk to us about email you didn't tell us at all how are you going to get there it was horrible Mark I just think you're being a bully I mean they might be okay I am being a bully then they deserve to be bullied it's hurtful to watch you I would have to agree with Mark I think it was the worst sales presentation I've heard we're not presenters okay we're Physicians so guess what I don't care what your background is if you're looking for money you got to sell your idea that business plan is so unclear I'm out with all due respect I just don't think you've explained how you're going to get users how you're going to monetize it I just don't see the business I'm out I was intrigued frankly it's depressing because I like new ideas in the medical space they're forever if they work but at the end of the day I can't connect the dots regarding how I make money I'm out fair enough thank you thank you all [Music] they just weren't prepared they were arrogant thinking that they were just going to be able to wing it and everybody doesn't know any better it's our baby man you're kind of bummed out you know I was expecting to be able to portray it a little bit better than we really did protein is never wasted when a death occurs what is that it means that others will see what happened here they'll learn from their mistakes so they won't make the same mistake I don't mind sacrificing a couple of doctors if it means the next two doctors can make me money

right now i'm sorry i'm sorry i didn't burn i didn't mean to burn your behind the opportunity is right here in front of me to take all i've learned and experience to the entertainment capital of the world las vegas okay rick you just burnt my ass sorry i have a question yes 1.5 million for 20 of your company or your business so your production means that you're telling me that you're worth seven and a half million dollars let's get serious here why actually i'm projecting to gross 12 million dollars in our first year i'm working with one of the top publicists in las vegas we've checked out many different venues and we found out that on the average seating between four and six hundred seats selling tickets at a price of sixty dollars doing two shows a day seven days a week but you haven't done this yet i have not done a las vegas production show right now i'm right now i'm currently a magician that i travel all over the country doing corporate events which we make last year last year i made 200 000 and i'm supposed to say you're worth a million five because maybe in vegas you're gonna make it you know how many magicians are in vegas they grow them like mushrooms lots of magicians in las vegas riddle me this rick yes who burnt my ass i'm sorry why don't i just take my million five and create mr wonderful's magic show in vegas cause i'm taking all the risk all the capital i call you say hey rick you want to work for me and i pay you 300 000 why do i have to give you you know 80 and i get 20 i put up all the money isn't that what this whole dig is about the guy that has the money makes all the rules that's how it works well yeah you're an employee you work for me if i don't like your magic i fire you in fact i burn your ass to get your money back right away i was i was thinking that i'd pay you twice your investment if you even make the money and that's the million dollar question if i make the money rick the reason most of these shows don't work and the reason they're so risky is you're not a known brand nobody knows rick the magician i give you the 1.5 million you rent the venue the 1.5 million is gone it's gone the day you open if people don't know you i could go to zero that's how that's how all magicians every magician in las vegas no no seriously rick before they go to vegas they have a brand they have a name no no no that's not true every magician doesn't have a name going into they all have pretty much the same story as i do why not start in a smaller town i'm really up for anything but this this is just my dream to be this and you just gave up on the dream just like that i'm up for anything no i gave him las vegas just like that no no no i've been working on this this deal right here for over three years working with this publicist who has worked for major yeah but publicists just want you to pay them yeah you just pay the publicist they'll tell you whatever you want to hear but the reality is you know vegas is incredibly expensive you know to get into a decent showroom cost a lot more than a million and a half dollars right now the rent for for most of showrooms is between six and eight thousand dollars a week a week a week a week my closest friend is siegfried and roy's manager okay 30 years managing them and he manages other magicians and still cannot get anybody else out in vegas because how challenging the market is now he's talking about i'm talking about the guy who created magic yeah it's one of the best shows ever this is vegas this is absurd i'm out what you're proposing is insane i the this isn't even a tolerable risk it's an insane risk i'm out you went for the holy grail you're not quite ready to go there i just think if you would have told us that we should invest in you and over some period of time we're gonna we'll grow with you and we'll help your career because we're sharks we know how to help i will give you advice but you ask for a million and a half dollars i ain't going to write you a check for a million and a half dollars for 20 so i can help your career go you set your sides high but you set them too high and it's not gonna work so i'm out rick you missed a fantastic opportunity i've never seen somebody throw a card that fast incredible but i got to tell you rick it takes 10 to 15 years to become an overnight success and you're not going to use my 1.5 million to become an overnight success with one act i'm out [Music] you're such a cute kid but you're nuts came in asked for too much too soon with nothing to prove that you could actually even attempt to pull it out nobody's gonna give you the money and i'm out well i appreciate your guys time and i look forward to seeing you guys in las vegas thanks guys thank you bye-bye my las vegas dreams are not over i'm going to continue to look for an investment so we can actually make this dream happen you ", "BeSomebody": "next into the tank is a platform to help you explore your passions [Music] i'm calling ah i'm calling every single one of you out i'm calling myself out all this talk about dreams and drive and destiny countless conversations about what we love inspirational quotes and motivational mantras we're all talk and i've had enough hello sharks my name is cass shake i'm the founder of be somebody and we're seeking one million dollars for 10 of our company we built the world's first experienced marketplace with a vision to pioneer experiential learning on our platform you can learn anything that you're passionate about by booking experiences with talented people around you you book them online and you meet up in person for a hands-on learning experience and the host of our experiences who we call passionaries get to make money doing what they love so robert if you want to add ninja skills to your already sexy repertoire of scuba diving and car racing you could book an experience with ninja warrior travis brewer [Music] oh wow yeah [Music] ladies if you guys want to ignite your dormant passion for dance which i know you all have you could book a group experience and you can learn anything from ballet to ballroom to bollywood yeah wow all right [Music] and mark you could book a soccer experience you can learn from the best two-time world cup champion two-time olympic gold medalist christine lilly wow you what's up christine hello how are you doing how are you good hello sharks i'm here today as a be somebody passionary and someone who truly loves this company and everything it stands for and they will host all our soccer experiences exclusively on their platform sharks we really believe we have the right mission the right movement and the right model and we would love for all of you to join us on this world-changing journey thank you so much to our amazing passionaries and be somebody thank you thank you thank you guys great tell us a little bit about your background so back in 2009 i was seven years into my role at procter gamble the largest consumer products company in the world i was leading social marketing for a lot of our bigger brands like tide and old spice and i just turned 30 i was going through a breakup and i was trying to figure out what my purpose was in life and that's when i first started to realize as soon as you start to focus your mind and your heart and your spirit and your soul on your passions the universe starts to open up doors and unlock windows you never thought possible and i started to learn the power of this word because it's intuitive and instantly personal people when people around the world hear be somebody it becomes about you and about what you love becomes about your personal passion whether it's photography or car racing or fashion that's what's powerful about it and as soon as i started to really see that there was something there i got a chance to leave p g and go lead social marketing at gopro for working for somebody you know well you're doing a lot of talking right and you're not getting anywhere right now right what's the end product let me show you guys so we built an ios app this is my profile you see all your profiles right here okay this is my profile page if you hit that little plus it opens up all my passions you can add as many as you want you can create them and then our algorithm takes everything you're passionate about then shows you experiences around you in your local area it's an experienced marketplace think about airbnb when you're booking houses here you can book an experience and then you can individual training yeah great question we take 20 of every experience that's booked on our platform on average forty dollars an example you actually have to aggregate a whole bunch of passionaries by the way i love your name cash thank you but unfortunately i've learned that happiness can't buy money so i've got to understand how fast you can scale this thing right so right to make cash right so what we have we have a global movement that reaches 5 million people that means five million people a month or either dropping this be somebody hashtag if you guys search it right now like you don't get on your phone search anything that doesn't matter what is that of your company or just in general be somebody i trade i was the first person in history to trade if you just put in b it'll pop up and someone could still click on it so it doesn't mean that's absolutely that's related we own every asset with be somebody that's fine right so it's kind of like gopro like we branded the the fisheye and he's trying to see what connects to revenue right right i'm a little confused what the platform is is the idea we just get together and do an activity we like like white water rafting or is it a training platform where i go to an expert white water rafting person great question i wanted to get back to the scale question i think that's important the number one way we found a scale is through strategic partnerships you guys just heard from christine lilly how do you protect yourself against barbara and i we go white water rafting right a big jagged rock somebody pushes her off the boat she cracks her head to the white meat right before her husband gets a brand new sexy wife he sues somebody right how do you protect yourself against lawsuits like that right now we haven't had that problem we know we're gonna have to figure that out as we scale i think that's the reason we're raising capital you know because we need some money lose it in a lot of ways and to insure yourself or do you have a disclaimer so how long have you been offering experience 12 months in austin texas at 24. so 12 months just as a beta used to have yeah so why are you open to everybody yet yeah at the end of 2015 we decided we're gonna our focus is scale so the first six months of 2016 we've been closing partnerships eighty thousand dollars how many how many people experiences did you book last month probably about two thousand dollars okay so again we have before your answer your answer to the potential litigation was you're raising capital is that to get a big insurance policy i mean i mean every every passionate that hosts a fitness or outdoor experience has to have liability insurance on their own it's part of our terms with the strategic partnerships when we scale the reason why they're partnering with us there's three reasons one because they believe in the mission you heard christine lilly two because they have a shared traffic kit why would she give you exclusivity when you have nobody on this because you probably had to qualify the exclusivity to an app or something specific as opposed to all bookings right we can know all bookings 100 of their revenue is dependent on you right listen did you guarantee your any minimums no we didn't we can't we didn't i mean but you guys are understandable she's going to starve she's begging for mark no because but i think the guys what's the most important part about this is people believe in what we stand for i'm gonna show you guys one thing real quick so i think i think it's important i used to carry this around back in 2011. a little eight by eleven car that i met myself when i was going around the world to try to inspire people you're killing us did you bring a collection plate [Music] [Music] all six sharks are still in but mark has an issue with cash selling the passion more than the merits of his business be somebody a booking platform for experiences cash rule number one the longer the back story the worst the deal well let me tell you what the rules are about our business more preaching always equals less money for the investor for those two reasons i'm out right i find you enormously abrasive you drive me nuts i feel as though you don't have the capacity to listen could you imagine what kind of a partner you would make for me i'm out right cash here's the beauty of a social platform here's the beauty of a movement a movement by nature is viral right you're not getting that growth no it's working exhausting you know what we're working we don't have passionaries yet because we haven't we haven't scaled our marketplace you know my bs and i'm not calling you out on this i'm just saying my my sense for that always goes up i don't understand the business right i mean i'm out i'm gonna jump in so there's so many apps out there it seems to me like this is just not gonna be one that's gonna make it i'm up [Music] cash how much how much of your own money do you have in this two hundred thousand dollars wow two hundred thousand we are pioneering experiential learning no you're not education's a 4.1 trillion dollar industry online learning is going three times as fast i preach preach preachers i still never got over how you're going to protect yourself against liabilities i just think you're going to have a lot of people teaching dangerous things and one lawsuit can kill the entire company i'm out let's leave all the passion and all this the kumbaya come by leave it aside for a second in the end shark tank's about making money we've built a brand kevin i'm gonna put you know what's gonna screw you up cash the fact that you're believing your own nonsense doesn't get done bro you got it what do you think i've been doing for three years no we haven't built a community from this he's an instructor we built a passionate community go online just search be somebody you're going to get inspired by all the stories that you're here the people that are here they're inspired by the movement to have an opportunity cash silence we're going to own the experience i'm calling you out in eight years of history you're one of the first people to ever have six shots at this point okay right you struck out on every one zero i'm out see you buddy go be somebody bro you ", "Pete & Pedro": "first up is an entrepreneur from season four returning to the tank with a new opportunity for the sharks hello sharks my name is Aaron Moreno and I'm here today seeking a 100 000 investment for 10 Equity stake in my new company Pete and Pedro so if I look familiar to you it's because I've been here before but last time I was pitching the alpha m style system but at 300 a pop for a fashion formula customers just didn't bite and neither did you but you gave me something more valuable a new Direction and life-changing advice you see I knew you were right I needed a lower price point product something that every guy needed and used well about a month after I was on Shark Tank there I am styling my hair when inspiration struck and Pete and Pedro was born a new line of super awesome men's hair styling products being Pedro equals Bueno hair we're selling directed the consumer which means a higher quality product at a great price guys buy it they try it they love it and sign up for the Bueno Hair Club where we automatically ship them their favorite Pete and Pedro product every four six or eight weeks book sharks I'm back this time with the product that men need and love and I'm not walking out of here again without a deal so who's ready to partner with me and share the hair all right so I've got some samples for you guys there's only four Kevin six different styling AIDS and a shampoo and conditioner smells delicious like lime and lemon like a freshly baked tiger let me ask you a question you're in a very exclusive Club you realize this I am a number of people that get back in the tank is very small so I'd like to know how fast the other one go to zero uh here's the thing it was uh so I was super excited right I didn't get a deal I was like no problem I'm still gonna be on national TV I'm on Shark Tank baby where dreams are made you know how many style systems I sold the first day the Shark Tank aired one Aaron let's let's call it what it was basically the Sharks were right it was your idea went to zero but great entrepreneurs understand failure is part of the success path now we have a new deal why is this one not going to go to zero is what I want to find because I'm already ahead of the game this is a million dollar company that I've built into making a million of sales right now yeah right at eight hundred thousand sales this month fifty five thousand wow and I'm growing and I'm growing at 15 per month how did you do that I am a YouTuber I talk about grooming I talk about style I talk about hair how many followers Jeff um right now I'm at six hundred thousand wow uh yeah I get 5.5 million views a month on my Alpha M YouTube channel and my website I'm a Savage on social media you're hilarious but what is the secret sauce the products themselves each and every one of my products is a rock star in the respective category you post a video you're going to talk about some grooming elements right you're getting ready to go out you show how you put the Pomade or the putty and you demonstrate the product and how many videos do you play wait wait no no no no let me go through it okay and don't wave your hand down on me I don't like it cut it out okay so how many views does it get in the first 24 hours it'll get around 75 000. I have a nine percent conversion rate when they go directly to hi I don't believe it no I I get okay that's unheard of no my numbers not for YouTube not for YouTube do you get paid for those or you're just selling you get paid by YouTube I also get paid by these Brands JCPenney sponsored a makeover series that I do um I've done a video for Chevrolet for the new Corvette um I'm talking to a few other big Brands now I mean I promote everything from underwear to Bumper socks remember them I am approached by everybody how much money do you get out of that I'm just wondering how much comes from you being paid as a great salesman and how much is from the actual product sale see it's separate I've got two different businesses how much did you bring in just everything as an endorser yeah from my Alpha m i did 600 000 last year wow so is that part of the dealership and here's why that's the problem I'll tell you why no it's not but let me tell you why I have no problem no it's not because what I have is credibility and the moment that I have somebody else's money on the line basically determine that this is a bad product but it's you selling it the real product is you this just happens to be what you're selling right now Aaron there's no other way to do it because how do you allocate your time if I give you a hundred thousand dollars for ten percent of the donkey deal what why would I want you spending any time doing anything else because it's the way that social media and influencers work here's the thing this is my full-time job but another part of this is me creating content

tank is a product in the health and wellness space [Music] what's going on sharks my name is alexio Gibson I was born and raised in the Bahamas and I am here seeking five hundred thousand dollars for five percent equity in my company now I'm a pretty healthy guy but I wasn't always this way in fact when I was 21 years old I weighed over 500 pounds it was told that I wouldn't live to see 30. so I knew I needed to do something right away to get my life back I started working out more eating healthy and even went vegan Mark Cuban yeah so during my transformation I found a nutritionist ingredient that had 90 percent of the minerals that our human bodies need and I incorporated into my life every single day now what is it it's called CMOS CMOS is a Powerhouse Marine ology that exists in our oceans and has 90 percent of the essential minerals that our human bodies have I wanted everyone to have this product so that they can become the best versions of themselves as well which is why I create created the transformation Factory a line of mouth-watering CMOS gels that you can take and get ninety percent of your nutrients with two tablespoons every day so tell me sharks who's ready to transform the world with me and see nothing but Green in the future now sharks in the front of you you have our mouth-watering line of CMOS shells for you to try yourself you will be tasting our mango strawberry banana pineapple dragon fruit and last but not least are elderberries the strawberry tastes very good it's almost like um jam or jelly more like a smoothie it tastes more like a smoothie so CMOS has 90 of the essential minerals that our human bodies need to function so you have zinc Baron you have iodine that treats thyroids and it also treats the gut the gut is where our immune system lives the only sweetener in this is agave organic agave syrup alexios you said you lost 300 pounds yes I did how did you do that and what was that like well I remember reading an article that you know some weight loss contestants on different reality shows worked out four to six hours a day and I told myself as a personal challenge I'm like man these people are as big as I am some of them are twice my age what's my excuse I can do six hours let's do this wow I became obsessed with becoming the best version of myself I would literally be on the elliptical and I would be envisioning what what is a a more healthy version of myself look like a more confident good for you and I started chasing that guy in my in my mind very very strong congratulations thank you guys thank you um what are your sales right now right now we are at 3.5 million sales today wow we started 11 months ago how are you Distributing it to get that kind of trajectory so uh the way this actually started my 80 year old grandmother was visiting from the Bahamas who has a lot of core mobilities and taking medication so I knew I wanted to protect her I would put this in her coffee every morning I was sharing stories on my Instagram store worry just showing like CMOS lattes every eight o'clock in the morning and I'll give it to Grandma and they're like I know what CMOS is I keep hearing about it can I please stop by and get some I'm a registered nurse I'm in the covid wing and I'm like absolutely you you ladies are soldiers come over grab it we didn't charge and I was giving this away for free not even thinking that it could have been a business and it wasn't until I was getting about 60 orders a week I said why don't I open an online store to make the process simpler it exploded from there we started running ads we started getting more SEO traction we had a 800 percent growth from February to March when we started running ads and people knew that we existed did you make any money on the 3.5 million in sales yes we have about 35 percent profit margin so you've made a million dollars in profit yeah 1.4 million we poured a lot of it back into the business but we have extremely healthy cash flow and is it all still direct to Consumer it's direct to Consumer 100 online so I'm curious what you'd use on money for it so the way I would use the money is I actually want to have a transformation Factory where we have the Ingenuity and the machines to shelf stabilize our products you want to do that to get on retail shelves right yes we want to get on retail shows how much are you selling each bottle for so an eight eight ounce raw CMOS sells for 24.99 24.99 yes 24.99 but you only use two tablespoons and what does it cost you to make it the cost for the smallest jar is four dollars and fifteen cents let's do margins yes that's great margins so how are you dealing with this when you manufacture it how are you making sure it's clean safe pure great question so because this comes from outside of the United States it has to be FDA cleared and cleared by Customs to even enter for consumption why would anybody pay 24.99 for a tiny bottle of what looks like baby food how did they learn about this this is a culturally driven product right in our community African-American Community this is something that is now being raved about and we're seeing growth in it so I've actually purchased it and it was in a plain jar and it was like an exclusive buy it almost felt like a drug deal I'll be honest I know somebody that can get you some and I was like all right I'll try it so everything that you're saying I do know to be true what I'm most intrigued about are your numbers you have other investors or Partners right now I'm a soul soul owner good for you baby I have no debt being first generation entrepreneur and everything this is where I do need help to where I you know I really want a strong financial background in a system that's one area that I would love to be extremely why are you only giving us five percent and why did you ask for five hundred thousand dollars because you don't need the cash and you know if you need that much help and guidance five percent is not going to get us excited so you know I just I'm very flexible in that I'll tell you what I'm looking for the most is I want to work directly with one of you you know I just want to be a sponge and keep growing as an excellent CEO I gotta be honest man for me you're checking so many of the boxes me being a health and wellness guy I can understand how this can fit in my other verticals there's tons of things that I'm now getting my hands into something like this could be of interest yes I I don't see five percent doing it for me I'm going to ask for 20 I think that you're going to need a significant amount of help in building the infrastructure to run your business can I tell you something I was going to make an offer of 20 as well I think that's a fair price and I think I have the expertise to help out in a real meaningful way so then if that's the case Barb then if you want to we split the 20 we keep the offer at 500 000 and we go 10 to 10. great idea that's our offer I want to thank you Barbara and Kevin so much for your first initial offer I do want to give the Sharks an opportunity to hear uh their offers understood I like that first initial offer interesting okay let me give you my first time I'm really intrigued I love Revenue I love cash flow even more you got both so that's really impressive yes I'm going to ask for more actually I'm going to give you the 500 000 for 30 percent and then I'm going to put Chef wonderful behind it and I'm going to sell it direct I sell millions of dollars of sous-vide cakes wines spices you name it none of that has anything to do with this I'm not doing it for 20 because the amount of work and setting this up and actually fulfilling to a giant direct to Consumer play like QVC is really really challenging all sharks are still in alexio has two offers on the table one from Kevin O'Leary and another from Kevin Hart and Barbara for his company transformation Factory thank you very much Kevin and Barbara I love the fact that you guys are interested what I would say is uh 20 is a huge amount for five hundred thousand they do the thirty percent off current sales you know we're doing over half a million a month in sales our profit margins are great there is a lot of room for growth we've managed to do this on our own and there's so many things because you don't know what you don't know right Alexa with all due respect you sound like you really need our help and expertise particularly when you want to make a left-hand turn into the retail space yes yes we know how to not tell you what to do you're the majority shareholder who can certainly weigh in on what's wise and what our experience has been to help you make a better decision yes I don't imagine you could go anywhere else where you could get the notoriety that this character to my right this cutie pie right here thank you Barbara thank you yeah I was 100 agree with you my kind of offer of to Kevin and Barbara would be for 20 800 000 in the company I love you so much and it sounds so juicy but no thank you Kevin Barb are you interested in countering back and going to 600 and staying at 20 I honestly feel five hundred thousand dollars with the help he needs is the right number I'll do it with you at that place [Music] okay if if you want to go at 600 right yes and keep it at 20 yes I'm telling you I I truly do believe that there's a significant value in what you have here and I do honestly believe in your growth potential and also you as a business person I'm sold on you you're going to need people that have relationships I know that if Mark aligns himself with me that makes whoever I want to get on the phone I didn't even take a breath don't judge well that's business still a cutie pie no not at all so now you have an offer yes I love that offer Mark I'm a huge fan we're both vegan I love it uh 600 000 20 to work with both of you would be incredible you guys have a deal done thank you so much thank you so much congratulations [Music] man thank you love your story love your story all right thank you thank you so much Mr Wonderful Lori yeah congratulations thank you thank you thank you making a deal with Mark and Kevin is incredible and growing my business with them is a dream come true yeah like round barber in the ocean I think a story behind a product makes a product that much better ", "Copa Di Vino": "last season we watched James Martin walk away from an offer from Kevin O'Leary for his wine by the glass business Copa Divino I'll buy 51 of it for six hundred thousand dollars the opportunity is greater than that I am going to go buy a thousand dollar bottle of wine tonight and I'm going to drink it because I'm weeping for the opportunity lost Cheers Cheers Cheers he's a dead man walking right just another deal let's see what he's up to now you know walking away from a deal from Kevin O'Leary was brutal but at the same time Kevin O'Leary only wanted the patents he didn't see any value in the brand we wanted to build Copa Divino as a brand you have those samples I'm proud to say that Copa divino's gone to five million dollars in sales in one year take this one to Chicago business is booming but with some of the largest retailers in the world Walmart Ralphs Kroger's 7-Eleven you name it they want us this way a little take it in take it in looking good my company is growing so fast that we're putting all our Revenue back into inventory we need Capital we need Capital fast that's why I'm going back [Music] are you kidding me I thought we kicked you to the curb James you're still dead to me nice to see all of you my name's James Martin founder and CEO of copa de Vino I'm here today seeking an investment of three hundred thousand dollars for five percent of my company you may all recall Copa de Vino wine by the glass no corkscrews no extra glasses just open and enjoy last time I was here I told you I would revolutionize the wine world I just launched the concept but I'd had over five hundred thousand dollars in sales in the first six months well this year I'm on track to sell over 5 million dollars in sales in truth I cannot keep up with demand I literally have twice the amount of orders that I can produce and to catch up I have to build a second bottling line and that is why I'm here today to give you that elusive second bite of the Apple we missed out on a perfect opportunity last time Kevin last time I was here you told me you were gonna drink a thousand dollar bottle of wine while weeping over the Mist opportunity agonize no more this time around we're gonna make a deal and commemorate the occasion I've bottled a thousand dollar bottle of wine in my Copa glass with your investment we'll drink these together and we'll toast the millions will continue to roll in I ask all of you please take a second look at Copa Divino and become my partners can you can hear it that's opportunity knocking again last time you were stuck on the idea of taking a now proven technology and hoarding it for just yourself when the real opportunity was to give the entire wine industry a license of this exact technology so that all wines could be sold this way instead of just making five million you could make 500 million and I wept like a child drinking a two thousand dollar bottle of wine realizing I was unable to help you out of your Madness and your insanity have you repented what was the offer you walked away from last time last time I was here it was my offer you offered six hundred thousand dollars for 51 of the IEP and the patents and you know what I thought it was a great deal it was even more than I would have offered you screwed up you guys have great memories James what are you drinking to come back here you know we're not going to be as gentle and as tender as we was last time to you I don't remember gentle when I was here last night [Laughter] until I do remember someone standing here and and professing the value of the brand and now I see someone standing in front of you that's proven the value of the brand and the value of the patents that you're really interested in are now much more valuable when I last saw you I said you were a dead man walking and you were dead to me now are you a ghost or are you real you know what I bottled a thousand dollar bottle of wine so you and I could go ahead and put the past in the past in the decision to bottle this I created a name for you for this wine I call it like a dead man walking this is for you buddy I like it James but I want to ask you a question that's going to help set you free what if we could take the technology to the largest three players in the wine industry and license it to them you keep doing what you're doing because you love it you'll pay me a royalty of which you'll get 49 and I will quadruple your net worth in two quarters by simply taking this to people that have distribution 50 times larger than you and every time they sell something you'll make money so we're right back to the original offer of course it is because it's the right thing to do if my memory serves me correctly you passed out some wine the last time no you know try try passing wine out this easily with any other brand there you go I'm waiting for the good stuff I wasn't interested last time and I just want to be thoroughly entertained while you go back and forth with these guys so I'm out thanks for the wine zero James I don't want to do battle with you anymore I want to figure out how to do business with you because I want to drink that good wine not the swell Barbara's drinking I'd like to figure out how can I invest in the piece that has the real value because wineries are a labor of love and you are in love I hate that business I love the packaging business you have you have a huge Global opportunity and I so much want to be your partner in that look I have a better understanding than I did last time but I'm still not comfortable that a six million dollar valuation even with the marginal value of the intellectual property is worth the investment you need to start telling us that you're negotiable on the equity portion very well said I I agree that we are here to negotiate I think it's really important for you to take some of the information that I have more seriously that I I at this point am an expert no one in in the world today knows wine by the glass in the marketplace like I do I agree so what's it going to take what are we going to do here give give me a chance to explain the valuation okay most national Brands which we are becoming sell for two and a half to three times the gross dollar value when you just sell a brand it shifts when will I be there that's one more year no no you're not James you know when you just came in here again I was happy to see you for some reason like oh like an old friend and he got a new haircut but as I'm listening and listening I'm having the same visceral reaction to you for some reason and I hope you take it well I didn't like you then and I don't like you now but take it well but I don't know where that's coming from I just have to say I'm out I'm not arguing that you see it at six million dollars but you have to see that we see it at something less potentially there's somewhere in the middle that we can meet but we're asking you to start to move the needle and start to move the valuation so that we can respond normally we don't do that normally we say you know what we're just going to tell you but you know what you're doing you're very aware of your industry you're very aware of the components of your business so we're asking you it sounds like you guys have an interest in this right if we can work on evaluation we may be able to make a deal here which I've been saying for a long time you've tortured me so long I'm gonna put an Offroad anyways I'll do the three hundred thousand dollars for 12 because that's exactly what you're worth right now so you're saying the company's worth two and a half million dollars that's exactly what it's worth you have something of tremendous potential here globally at some point I know I'll be able to convince you to set it free and you'll make so much money you can kick back on the Copa Hillside and say Kevin O'Leary was right I'm so lucky to have it as a part that's what's going to happen and my ticket to entry is 300 000 all right you beat me into a pulp give me the good stuff I can't take this anymore before you make a decision I'm gonna try to change his mind on something do you have anybody you can call you know or gotta go to the bathroom or anything I do have someone to call go make your phone call because we need a moment all right okay thank you [Music] 12 isn't a whole lot of skin in the game that's my problem that's my issue with it right that's my problem I think we offer more money at a slightly lower valuation among three of us I like it so we get more Equity more in the upside right why not try for 30 marks we get 10 each I don't think you'll go for it but we can address that I think appreciate proven moving technology proven product you've proven there's a market and when I started Sam Adams everybody no matter was a dumb idea and nobody would invest and I only got like low ball offers and look where Sam Adams is today a passion will take you the Long Way watch what he does when he comes back he's going to be complicated again James who did you call I called Jim Cook he's the founder of Samuel Adams he's basically the the father of craft brewing in America and Jim's Been instrumental in bringing my company to this level what did he say to you Jim basically wanted to make sure that whoever I'm becoming a partner with that they share in the dream they understand the vision they understand the possibilities is he an investor in the company or an equity owner in the company Jim's an advisor an advisor he doesn't have any Equity no equity then why did he just give you the money for your extra line that you need the best advice is going to come from someone who's not best in your company you know I really respect cook he's a legend the beverage industry no question but he's not spending his money right here so what did he tell you to do with the 300 000 for 12 percent that Kevin offered you you know basically it's it's half the price of what the value of my company is and he recommended that if I'm interested in trying to have a partner as established as Mark Cuban that it would be valuable to me to pay additionally above what I'm asking for for an investment of three percent so three hundred thousand for eight percent of the company that's your counter that's my counter Mark Cuban's not interested in that and tell me why mark because it's not enough to get in the game because you want the value of the Sharks and what we bring to the table and that's an effort right just like you've created evaluation yeah we have our own valuations of our time and our effort as well and what I'm saying it's just not worth it what I suggested and they agreed with was that we need to get significant skin in the game but it's worth putting in more money to get it so what we suggested was six hundred thousand dollars for thirty percent because that's two hundred thousand dollars a piece ten percent equity a piece three rock stars to help support you and build your brand and you still retain 70 so you get significant amounts of Leverage and you have the capital should you need it to expand into other product lines to fund your growth twice the money you came here looking for I agree that having more skin in the game makes a lot more sense for you guys I agree that that could be a greater value and asset to my company does it get us a deal in the stadium next year in the Dallas Mavericks it gets you first crack I can't make a promise just because we have a service organization that I have to go through but when we were talking you know I own the Landmark Theaters and quite a few of them sell alcohol and single serve wine and the bigger theater serving alcohol makes perfect sense yeah why can't be talking yourself out of a sale you need to make a decision don't do this again James [Music] nobody in the tank has ever done you've been given the American dream to come back who's who's in on this is you you and you yes sir all three Kevin if I get that phone call from you all the time that says we've got to split this company up no James Mark and I will keep Kevin in line don't worry you've convinced me from the very get-go because you went from 500 000 to 5 million and then 12 million next year you were right about that concept you need to make a decision right now on what you want to do I want to be partners with you guys but if I trade my company 30 for 600 000 and and basically give my company at that kind of discount and I don't have any kind of guarantee that I can even get into you know the single stadium that you control then I'm in a position where I'm trying to understand what kind of value that you might be adding then you just have to decide whoa whoa James you wouldn't have come back here if you didn't see value in the tank in us so don't ask us to start selling ourselves back to you now you're the one that came back we're not we didn't go see you no more talking we made a very fair offer to you you've got to make a decision it's a million dollar bottle of wine thirty percent of the company that should go for 1.2 million dollars and I'm going to sell it for six hundred thousand I don't think you're thinking clearly on this well hang on whoa Kevin I think he's saying yes what are you saying James let me drink one of those with you Kevin celebration of the deal James what are you saying I'm out you know what I'm out playing games and more than playing games you knew the number you knew the number when you walked out you knew the number when you walked in and you came in and created drama I came in looking to make partners with you at a very reasonable valuation that was done by experts not by someone that says well I I see what the wine industry is that my friends have wineries these are the top experts in the country who've told me what my company's worth but none of them gave you any money you know as well as we all do that it's worth what someone will pay for it I'm just telling you James I'm out [Music] Robert Kevin yeah James I I'm I'm really out I mean you just came here to waste our time so cheers [Music] I'm sorry but I think I've earned this [Music] I came here in good faith really wishing for these sharks to become my partners no one could share in that Vision it was all about the money whether they could get a discount on the value of my company I won't be back before you go don't forget to subscribe to the Shark Tank Youtube channel and click on that notification Bell to keep up with everything that's bubbling in the

sure your kids are eating well there is sugar in everything and sugar is sneaky it hides in the most innocent looking places like juice most juices on the market have upwards of 25 g of sugar if you were to give your kid an 8 oz glass of juice every day for a year you would be giving them 20 lb of [Applause] sugar don't do it oh Phoenix you are sugarcoated my friend I knew I had to give him something better and that's why I created kids love okay Phoenix get into position kids love has this much sugar yeah gotcha kidss love has no sugar but you know what it does have vitamins and

sweetening ingredient that is replacing the sugar so that's my secret recipe it's my trade secret W that's really good but it is a combination of coconut water juice a little bit of regular water and then I sweeten it to cover the vitamins with less than 0.1 gram of stevia not bad what's really amazing is that it is only 10 calories I know I can really taste the stevia though is that real coconut tast really delicious taste the stevia but basically I tried to formulate without the stevia and then you get the back Taste of vitamins and are the kids pushing back on the C aftertaste or not no

well how much did you pay for a manufacturing run was um that I just did so I just finished a run and I spent um 57,000 on the run because it's tetr pack my plan and why I'm here is to really focus on West Coast right now and then do duplicate that plan to other coasts in a very strategic pattern following where my demographics are I got it that sounds very fancy but where are you going to get the money to do any of that well so right now I'm also in the process of talking to my current investors about putting money in to basically track me and what your origal investors say going back to them for more money are they eager to lend it you know now that I'm finally have gotten distribution in order and I'm ready to be in stores listen to me a minute you did all that and spend all of that money before you found out the most important component which is can it sell how fast can it sell how much of it can I sell okay so I am at that point now that I have my distribution in lock I understand that I spent money I am totally willing to own my mistakes and ways that I could have Sav here's here's the rub you're not owning your own mistakes really the investors that gave you their money are really owning your mistakes and then you come here and you're asking us to follow your other investors down that little yellow path well it makes absolutely no sense it's amazing to me that you don't see what's wrong with that picture for all of those Reasons I'm out yeah AI I mean the one thing that you haven't owned up to is saying that you're going door too and I understand it's tough with the family I am I'm doing Grassroots marketing efforts marketing is not sales marketing is trying to create demand so that there sell through it but I am selling the product what I had to do in order to get it to the market is to come up with a strategy and unfortunately I did not plan on that the distribution was going to take this long to lock down again you say the word distribution yeah I didn't say distribution you're just talking about me doing it yes whose company is it mine who's responsible for it who should be doing all the selling me that's what I'm doing now no going out and getting a distributor is not doing all the selling for those Reasons I'm out a I wish you all the best okay thank you this idea has Merit but we need sell through data because I don't know if the kids are going to love it I don't know because I don't see reorders through the distribution you have yet so we are online Thrive Market in the last 6 months has reordered every month we have sold out so many times that I actually have out of stock problems encouraging but I don't want to take this journey with you I just can't do it I'm out I'm sorry okay Ash I have to tell you I admire how much your standing your ground you've made mistakes everybody here makes mistakes the problem is Cash is the lifeblood of the business agreed once you run out of cash you're dead you've learned the theory of great business plans with all due respect honestly notri maret I am getting the re fighting in the trenches you're not out there selling it that's all I'm doing I have three little kids at home and I'm the person hopping on the plane to sell the product I burn through $50,000,000 coming in actually I'm sorry I it makes me nervous about giving you more money I'm out listen you went through the process of trying to overprotect patent everywhere it cost you a fortune and that was a big hole for you because the bottom line is you didn't even know if your product would sell well I feel that while I liked the product you got into that trap but unfortunately as an investor I wouldn't want to be involved with it and I'm sorry I hope you do well but I'm out thank you I blame you for it you made a huge mistake I'm sorry it's just the numbers don't lie good luck We wish all our entrepreneurs good luck but you've got a wall to climb good luck thank you so much I feel like I did get a little beat up I think that you know because the shks got so hung up on the money that I've raised they didn't see the true value of kids love and unfortunately because of that they're obviously not the right investors that was a huge mistake on the patent I got to tell you when it's my money and I lose it I feel bad but when I take a dollar from you that is I wake up every day to give you your money back and she didn't even feel bad about it dive into the Shark Tank Youtube channel And subscribe now ", "Cat Amazing": "[Music] first in the tank is a business to entertain board felines

three different sizes the classic the sliders the mega increase in difficulty so your Kitty's always being challenged and every sale helps us donate toys to shelter cats awaiting adoption so what do you think can cats and sharks get along so right now you guys can get the full feline experience right I actually put some treats inside there so you guys are going to be cats oh my gosh but but no cheating put away the opposable thumbs we can get it the fastest let's go [Music] I am one with the cat you got the panther inside what made you decide to start this so I originally came to America when I was eight years old um I didn't know anyone I didn't know the language and we got here I moved around constantly where'd you come from I came from Russia and so um that was a recipe for not making friends very easily so what actually ended up happening is that my closest friendships my my deepest friendships ended up being without household pets now fast forward 15 years my wife and I are moving into our first apartment together and what's the first thing we do we adopt a cat mookie problem was keeping mookie active and engaged in their Studio that we lived in which was basically the size of like a litter box um so it was actually mookie that came up with this product he started taking a little red ball and putting it inside of a folding book stand that kind of was sitting on the floor and getting it out and when I saw him do that I grabbed a box that was sitting around grabbed the box cutter and I started making little mazes for him um he kept getting the balls out kept making more mazes and as we built build built I realized you know what we can do we can build this into a business and that's how cat amazing was born so does mookie get a royalty um yeah I I wish you did mookie was diagnosed with kidney cancer and he didn't get to live to see the launch but he lives on in all of this he lives on here he's here Andre tell us the sales Journey yeah so yeah so the sales Journey so basically from 2011 to uh 2017. it was pretty much like a hobby project it was something about like 20 000 a year so in 2017 I finally broke out of my sort of first generation immigrant mentality of you know get a job hunker down get the paycheck be grateful um then I heard that sort of second generation voice calling that you know my parents didn't bring me here um to not seize opportunities I quit my six-figure job yeah to go work on this um I bring in a whopping thirty four thousand dollars everyone close to me was very concerned as to what I was doing in my life so we kept hustling 2018 was north of 300 000 in sales wow so we 10 accidentally one year okay 420 000 the following year 550 000 of the year after that was last year yeah 720 with 40 years so what does it cost to make it uh and what are you sell them at um so landed um they range between four to nine dollars they sell for 16 for the smaller one 23 and then the third one's gonna be launching a 30 range where do you sell this so most of my sales come from Amazon I actually deliberately drove people to Amazon because of Amazon's ranking so I wanted people to actually buy on Amazon so it goes up in the category and it gets more visibility and do you have profits today oh yeah the business profitable so I make they're a cost in between so um I cover all the shipping for the customers okay so the margin so the profit margin at the end is about 20 it's about 20 it's about 20 like all in one why twenty percent though so I'm just so close um I I keep my profit margins low on purpose um to be honest I mean this is a product that's close to my heart it's a cat enrichment product and it brings happiness to people um so it would really break my heart if somebody born afford it but Andre you see a problem there don't you because you know we want to be one with the cad and you know give cats all the exercise they need but if you're going to take in an investor they're going to want you to at least not necessarily maximize profits but at least optimize profits yeah get a bit more more buffers yes if we're going to give you all that money we need to get a return back on that how are you going to support that um so with volume yeah look Andre you know your motivation is great and honorable but it's not motivation to take in an investor I don't agree with that we'll make it up in volume approach so for those Reasons I'm out I appreciate it thank you you're welcome so the primary reason that I'm here is actually not the money it's the partner um it's the partner who gets the brand who understands what I'm trying to do here with this and who's willing to guide and take it to the next level so I'm very much open to guidance and advice as to how to increase that margin and to make that investment worthwhile for you you know Andre I love cats I love cats it does not I'm gonna make you an offer in in honoring Mookie's short life but inspirational one I'll do it for two dollars a unit until I get back my two hundred thousand then it drops to one dollar in perpetuity I don't want any Equity the reason that works for you I'll just point out uh Wicked Good Cupcakes we've just sold to Hickory Farms I never had Equity but we were so incentivized to make the sales grow because I was getting a royalty off every jar then we turned it into the number one brand brand cupcake gift in America so it became huge and it was all social media telling the story there's millions of cat lovers you're not getting to them right now I can help you do that that's my offer thank you very much everybody knows I'm the pet lover up here I love animals I think where you need some guidance is what price to sell that how to sell it but I think you have a major good offer I'll make you the same offer I'll give you the two hundred thousand dollars two dollars a unit and then once I get my money back a dollar a unit from there on mm-hmm I have a question why haven't you gone to retail I'm on the Petco Foundation I'm on the board and I like the retail aspect so that that's a great question I actually tried to get into retail I went to smaller Stores um it was a tough nut for me to crack that's one of the reasons I'm really hoping for a partner who can open those doors all right I'll I'll give you 200 000 for 25 percent that's not horrible Lori what are you doing do you want to make an offer so before you make your offer let me just let me say one one more one don't do that don't do that yeah I want to just level with you on guys on one other thing uh-oh okay and I was really hoping that um one of you guys would just take my initial offer and I wouldn't have to go here but um so I've never said this a soul and now National Television when mookie died um I buried him with a note and the note made a promise and the promise was that one day I would commit all of cat amazing to helping shelter cats now I understand completely that promise binds only me and my share of the business and I certainly understand that giving away a part of something big is better than giving away part of something small yep I get all that but when you're talking about a royalty perpetuity or 25 it starts to feel like I'm going back in a promise to a friend [Applause] you said 25 right yeah can I make you a slightly weird counteroffer and just consider it it's your company I would be willing to part with 20 of the business 10 to you and ten percent we commit to going towards shelter cats in whatever way we can what would you say to that you're coming in with me you're offering me you're offer me exactly what you came in here with clever what are you talking about well I'm giving I'm still giving up you're giving away my 10 yep yeah I'd be willing to give up 15 you know what 20 so total is 25 I give up I would give up so 10 to you 15 to the shop advance I just want you to know that which is exactly well let's not let's not compare history of helping animals I'm on a board of Petco to save animals so don't make this end up looking like I'm the cruel one no no no no no and so why don't we do this I'll give you the 200 000 I'll give you that for twenty five percent five percent uh my portion goes towards this cause and you match that with five percent of your portion wait a minute I'm gonna make you an offer I'll give you the 200 000 for 22 that's it no royalty just straight Equity wow [Music] would you be willing to do what Damon just said to give five percent of yours and get five percent of mine and we commit that to helping shelter cats whatever we can so we give 10 to the shelters together foreign I really appreciate it thank you so much you got to deal with the shark that I was here to get and we got to deal with Lori and I'm fulfilling a promise to a friend I give up a little more Equity but I think it was worth it to fill a promise to Mookie ", "Slate": "next into the tank is a grown-up version of a childhood favorite [Music] what up sharks I'm Manny I'm Josh and we are slate chocolate milk we're seeking 400 000 in exchange for 10 of our business sharks you can be the happiest version of yourselves if you Embrace who you are and what you enjoy Lori you can sing in traffic if it makes you smile Mark you can wear that hat if you feel like it's just and Kev my dad my guy you can do that workout because if it's exercise to you and who cares and sharks nice socks Cub that's why we can chocolate milk literally we are asleep the first lower sugar higher protein line of lactose free chocolate milks for adults we use a process called ultra filtration which allows us to filter out the natural lactose sugars for milk leaving us with a creamy better for you chocolate milk we paired that with a popular latte canning process which makes these puppies shelf stable able to be shipped to your doorstep sharks you can be a part of our chocolate milk Revolution so who wants to join us modern Milkman and give chocolate milk a Clean Plate let us try it yes lactose this will be a very short pitch if we can't and just so you know before we hand these out we have one can it's just a prototype though the can is just a prototype that means pre-sales right it does four million valuation huh or no Revenue please so what do you want to start with we're going to talk first so dark first okay first so this dark chocolate we are targeting the dairy alternative [Music] I do not like that at all Mark do you drink dark chocolate do you eat dark chocolate I eat dark chocolate you do yeah it's just I mean I didn't love it okay so when mock threw up on it I liked the clothes classic better than the dark actually that's fair so the classic should remind you of that chocolate milk that you drank growing up there's a distinct dryness after you swallow it on my tongue there's a little funky chicken thing going on there because I know what chocolate milk tastes like it's one of my greatest weaknesses and I would love to get away from the calories I'm hoping you're telling me this is a big alternative calorie option absolutely so we have 75 less sugar than chocolate milks currently on the market you could have three of our cans and that would equate to the amount of sugar and more or less calories so we have 130 calories in each of each one of our cans we have nine grams of sugar why is it so big so the protein baby half of consumers right now are decreasing the amount of sugar which is why we're playing on that Trend and increasing the amount of protein what do you make it for now yeah so right now we make it for 85 cents selling to a distributor what price 1.77 52 but they haven't sold yet so you'll be out at 3.99 at retail 299 2.99 you said it's a prototype so I would assume you haven't produced the product yet yes so we've done a pilot run but yet you have a big price on it so the valuation but I like it either I eviscerate you now or you defend it now right it is awesome what were you thinking so you have two ridiculously good looking Founders which is a huge part of the valuation only to Barbara so our our third partner was a food broker for 40 years and he grew the largest Greek yogurt company from 140 000 in sales to over 150 million in the Northeast alone that is one of the reasons it's worth 4 million he's invested in three other businesses that are all doing over 20 million in sales so he is a partner and he is basically our VP of sales so you don't you don't need a shirt because this guy was successful with other businesses we're worth this valuation yeah but not it's it's a non-sequitur it doesn't make sense so the reason why we talk that way is because of the relationships you know as good as anybody in the food world it's all about your relationships the way that we're getting it we've gotten in front of already four major retailers and we've been able to do that because of him but it's all about the product at the end of the day absolutely you can have a million connections but if people don't like the product or the test wait a second the plan that I come from it's all about the profits you don't have any you're asking us to pay an enormous price value it at four million dollars based on the fact that you got a cool guy that built another business who's working with you that we don't know about if you're worth 4 million I wonder what I'm worth I've got a lot of relationships I'm Mr Wonderful I got to be worth like four billion I would say no that's me Kevin it's ridiculous we know we're at the starting line we we just don't want that Bigfoot to crush you I know it's coming and I know it's going to happen it's going to be ugly I'm doing everything in my power to help you get us to that four million yeah you are so in fact you are now farther away than when you came in here I think there's something here that's like really wrong you haven't sold a thing but you're saying that I should give you four hundred thousand dollars I'm kind of a wish and a prayer do you realize how that sounds weird I think that we probably didn't frame the entire like where we are correctly I think that's probably something we did incorrectly if you'd come in with sales and other things and all of that you're just too early no absolutely it's just too early I'm sorry I'm out have you guys raised money already we have we raised about two hundred thousand dollars at what valuation around the 400 000 valuation so you sold half the company for 2 15 15 and he bought in and he gives us 10 hours a week we're gonna pay 10 times more than the super sales dude right I mean yeah yeah absolutely you're not even chocolate milk cockroaches you are single cell amoeba you are nothing yet it doesn't taste good enough you have to go to market you know you got to work on it and I want to be kind to you I'm working on a new nicer Mr good Lord and I'm having a really hard time with you containing myself but I'm smiling I'm out thanks for your attention thank you Kevin and just so you guys know we've done over 100 iterations well what you didn't provide for us is any proof that you surveyed 10 000 people but if you had said we've done this many taste tests we've analyzed it we've perfected it we find that people will pay the price right you basically went from a business planning concept to give us your money and that's really rough to ask any investor to do I think that's fair yeah because of those Reasons I'm out all right thank you guys you saw my reaction for a protein shake okay you're willing to accept that it's not the same I just don't think it's like oh wow this is amazing and I I just have to have it so for those Reasons I'm out all right thank you Mark okay Rohan beverage guy okay guys I like your guys energy I like your thinking of where you're going your proteins are your sugar's low but when I go with my gut on this and that's all we have to go with when you have zero sales yeah my gut on the product is it's just not there okay unfortunately I'm up I appreciate it go out and crush it yeah I appreciate it thank you for the time really appreciate it congrats guys good luck [Music] it was really just diving and evaluation super early didn't allow us to tell our story talk about our product talk about all the relationships that we have and it was a great learning experience because if we had to do it again we'd do it differently yeah and uh the Sharks were hungry let me tell you they're just hungry before you go don't forget to subscribe to the Shark Tank Youtube channel and click on that notification Bell to keep up with everything that's bubbling in the tank ", "The Scrubbie": "ain't no better timing now boys ain't no better time tonight ain't no better timing now let's do it [Applause] next up is an innovation in the cleaning space [Music] hi sharks my name is matt i'm jeff and i'm tyler and we're seeking a hundred thousand dollars in exchange for 10 of our company called the scrubby it's called the what's the scrubbing now sharks almost everyone has a kitchen sink sprayer and probably tried using it to clean off dishes at one time or another the problem is to get the last bit of food off your plate you're gonna end up scratching your fine china oh no you're probably gonna get a little wet in the process the scrubby is a universal cleaning attachment that turns your ordinary sink sprayer into a supercharged cleaning machine by harnessing high pressure water and putting a scrubbing attachment right where you need it the scrubby cuts down cleaning time and conserves water and since you're not physically touching the scrubber you can clean using hot water with no worries about burning your hands oh not only that the scrubby's gonna adapt to your newer pull down style faucets as well say hey what you heard it here this scrubby centerpiece will pop out in reverse with its flexible tapered interior ridges it'll attach in a flash and be ready to rock but white sharks there's more right there is check this out the scrubby has a threaded interior so you can take it outdoors and screw it right onto your garden hose that's right sharks use it to clean off your outdoor tables and chairs your car wheels and tires your windows and doors your boat your coolers your your birdbath okay tyler we get it indoors are out the scrubby will handle the chore and we're confident that with your help we can make this a success now which one of you sharks is ready to clean house with the that's right [Applause] good job this is interchangeable so this is your scratchy side this is your soft side and then it's disposable just throw it away and you get refills it comes with three sponges how much does it cost 14.99 is what we're selling for and what are the replacement sponges well we're selling them for 9.99 for three of them and that's on a subscription base so every two months you get three sponges so nine dollars rubby's subscription scrub daddy doesn't have subscriptions you know guys can i just make a comment about it first time i've ever seen it it's ugly i mean it looks very very industrial to me if we wanted to spend more money on it we could have created a better model but we wanted to get our margins costs lower so with this unit we're paying hardly next to nothing for it we paid three dollars a second is it a prototype these are manufactured units what kind of sales we got okay so 2019 um describe these amazing product it's one of a kind it's the first of its kind the adjectives there's no numbers right yes we have two patents and one in the facility patents one utility patent and one pending so guys is there a number so 2019 we we did a launch at a local trade show in wichita and we killed it everybody loved it so we so in those cup two days we sold a couple hundred scrubbies how many dollars so in dollar cents what we made at the show no just what do you give me 2019 sales i've asked you five times so so total we've sold eight hundred sixty eight subscribers how many dollars is that that is right around thirteen thousand dollars oh no we don't know what's up this year gonna look like yep sales wise we we business wise we did some online marketing we didn't have enough funds to do a successful online marketing campaign and content it's never good when mr wonderful who loves numbers asks you what were sales in 2019 what are sales in 2020. and there's a lot of them i mean just give me a number right so total sales to date is 868. dollars scrubbies so why can't you answer kevin's question yeah whatever so tell us your forecast for this year this sells this year we yeah the forecast for this year if we are predicted from other companies that want to do business with us there for projections that we will do around 320 000 this year yeah so they're just guessing there's no real there there right that's the problem that's why you're here so have you sold too many stores and put this up but we haven't sold to any stores no we're not in retail so i'm curious have you been watching shark tank a long time yes yes seen a lot of them seen a lot of them who did your packaging in your logo one of our graphic designers there's a friend remember lori i'm working on anger management this season classes i just i can't take it anymore i have to ask a question i have to ask oh my god you are so rude very simple just two numbers i'm begging for two numbers lifetime sales today 13 000 no all in so lifetime sales is 13 000. this business is not worth a million dollars in february we got pretty excited at the trade show we were the busiest booth there we must have had 50 people come up to us and tell us you guys need to be on shark why didn't you sell it we got the call the very next day still keep do you know what 24 000 box score is is when a guy plays 24 minutes and gets zero points zero assists and zero rebounds wow it's noteworthy because if you play 24 minutes something should fall on your lap right a ball should come your way roll your way you accidentally trip and pass the ball you guys just sold nothing you guys are a 24 000 box score because just out of chance some lightning something should have been sold and you couldn't find a way to sell we had that opportunity we were approached by a company that no no that's not the point that's not the point that ourselves we wanted to go out and knock on every door that we possibly could but we also wanted to protect our idea so we went back to our patent attorney and claimed yeah does it matter it's just another excuse right look i've heard every eenie meenie miney moe excuse me does it not bother you that you design something that looks from a logo name perspective almost exactly like another product laureen invested in that should remain nameless it doesn't bother you name kind of sounds to say but it's that's not the same okay so i'm glad that robert brought that up i was about to before i was so rudely are you going to show wait here's the thing guys your logo is so close to scrub daddies you use the same font right but scrub dance before scribbling did you think about this while you were doing it it never crossed your mind because it's it's a really um very coincidental really that it's the same honestly no when our designer came up with this we thought it looked great when your logo's really close i don't like that and i don't want confusion on the market i'm out that the scrub daddy doesn't have an attachment that connects to your face you also don't have to use your hand attachment the future of our product we foresee different attachments differ different purposes to be able to screw onto the scrubby yep with a plastic thread you can have the car scrubby dog scrubby i actually found this intriguing but you know when i started my first company out of law school peace works to promote peace between arabs and israelis there was not a period of one day let alone one year where i just waited like it was about survival i had to figure it out and eventually i decoded it and the fact that you went for such a long period trying to figure things out concerns me a great deal and for that reason i'm out thank you yeah guys i you know to that point i mean to me there's two types of entrepreneurs there's the hungary and there's the satisfied and you've been doing this for two years you don't have that desperation of hunger but you wake up and you gotta sell man right so i'm out guys i i really was underwhelmed i think you could have done a better job with this one of you guys has to sell the stuff i am an investor i have a hundred thousand dollars i have no reason to give it to you i'm out so i i know the decisions that we make today define us tomorrow so i mean we're gonna go out take care guys good luck you guys are figured out you'll be seeing us i hope so guys good luck guys not quite how they wanted it to go no get off your butt and sell it's good to dream it's better to hustle well darn yep well we're gonna sell more scrubbies they compare us a lot to the scrub daddy but the only thing we have in common is that the ability to make hundreds of millions of dollars and we know within the next few years or less we're gonna reach that goal you ", "Pashion Footwear": "Eerste\nIn die tenk is 'n gemaklike weergawe van 'n mode-stapelvoedsel.

Dis die verwyderbare enigste ondersteuning. Dit is\nregtig die kern van ons IP. Daar was verwyderbare hakke\nvoor, ja, maar niemand is ooit innoverend nie,\nso ek gaan hieroor opstaan. O Wow. Dit is soos springlewendigheid. Ja. So om\nsit hulle weer aan, jy haak net hierdie bietjie hier,\npop dit weer in, gee dit 'n draai, dit sal klik en jy is teruggesluit\nop sy plek. Gotcha. So ek neem aan dat jy 'n hele paar van\nHierdie? Ons het Ja. So dit was 'n jaar en 'n paar\nVerander en ons het 'n bietjie meer as $ 800 gedoen,\n000 in verkope. En wat is die wat is die opbrengste soos?\nJip. So ons terugkeer en ruil persentasie is 24 persent. 24,\nJa. Die skoene is egter gemiddeld is 20%,\nnet omdat die grootte vir skoene is so moeilik. En u verkope is netto verkope na\nalmal lewer geen netto verkope nie, 500, 500 duisend. OUKEI\nelke vrou wat ek ken, haat haar hoog hakke, elkeen van hulle,\nen kan nie meer as in hulle wandel nie drie of vier uur. Hoekom was dit jy\nwie het ges\u00ea laat ek iets doen aan Hierdie?\nSo in my tweede jaar op universiteit, Ek was uit by 'n sororiteitsveer\nformeel en ek het 6 duim hoog gedra hakke soos universiteitsmeisies doen. Maar hoog\nhakke as jy probeer dans is nie gemaklik nie. Dit is regtig\nmeer van 'n wankel. En ek wou bors 'n skuif. So ek het haar my\nho\u00eb hakke en na die dans geneem vloer kaalvoet, ongelukkig. Tragedie en inspirasie nogal\nletterlik een van die ander getref jong vroue het haar per ongeluk gestamp\nstiletto deur my voet en vasgedruk ek deur die toon. My god\ndeur die toon. Soos reg deur. En terwyl ek aan die kant van\ndie dansvloer, dit het my opgeval as vreemd dat daar\nhierdie maatskaplike verwagting vir vroue om ho\u00eb hakke volgens formule te dra\nprofessionele geleenthede. Almal weet hulle het seer en dat hulle\nongerieflik en tog is daar geen Oplossing. So, Haley,\nhoe het jy jou $ 500, 000 in netto verkope? Ons is almal aanlyn. En ons kon deur verkoop\ndigitale bemarking, PR en dan ook mondeling.\nHaley, jy is super indrukwekkend. Dankie.\nEk wil jou agtergrond hoor a bietjie. Ja\nAbsoluut. So toe ek op universiteit was, Ek was al baie in die\nkopruimte van wanneer ek gradueer, Ek wil vir myself werk. En\nso na daardie impalement insident, Ek duif eerste in kop. Begin by verskillende geleenthede\nen eintlik die 1ste $ 26 ingesamel, 500 en ek het eintlik die eerste\nwerkende verkoopsman monsters die dag voor my kollege-gradeplegtigheid. So\nhulle het hul eerste blaaskans gekry. Was jy dra jou skoene daarin\ngradeplegtigheid prentjie? Ja Absoluut. En gelukkig sou ek eintlik\nhet die maatskappy genoeg opgebou hierby punt dat toe ek gegradueer het, ek was\nvoltyds kan aangaan. Ek het gebring op 'n skoene-ontwikkelingspan,\ngehuur op ACO, baie student gebring\nVrywilligers. Eintlik was dit $ 26, 000. Ja,\naanvanklik het ons meer sin gekry as wat ek nou my maatskappy besit. So\nons het altesaam 2,5 miljoen ingesamel Vandag. 2,5 miljoen,\nalles op omskepbare note. So op die oomblik ioon 83% van die maatskappy,\nmaar nadat hulle tot bekering gekom het, dit hang natuurlik van waardasie af.\nMaar byvoorbeeld, as u vandag my ooreenkoms sou aangaan,\nEk sou op 45% wees. O en dat ons sal moet\nOnderhandel. En so gaan jy om uiteindelik te besit as u 'n ooreenkoms kry\nminder as 45%. Maar ek gaan besit 'n bietjie minder van 'n veel groter\nmaatskappy met die hulp van 'n gesin, waarvan ek altyd 'n aanhanger is. Maar hoe\nbaie kontant het jy oor in die Bank? Op die oomblik het ons ongeveer $ 250,\n000. Hoeveel voorraad het u Op hierdie oomblik? Ek het $ 150,\n000 se voorraad teen kosprys. Wat is jou maandelikse brandwond?\nOns maandelikse brand op die oomblik gaan oor 90 000 voor bemarking. U brandwond is $ 90,000 per maand. Ja\njy het drie maande van. Kontant oor, ja. Maar dit ges\u00ea,\nEk was al voorheen in hierdie situasie en ek het daaruit gekom. Iets\njy moet van my weet is ek is een van die veerkragtigste mense wat jy sal\nooit ontmoet nie. Terug in 2019, ons was in 'n situasie waar ek gevind het\nons $ 80,000 skuld en ek het besef, OUKEI\nEk het net genoeg kontant in die bank om dit 30 dae te maak of ons is uit\nBesigheid. En so tref ek die grond Loop. Ek het elke liewe\npersoon wat sou luister en ek gesluit $ 1,000,\n000 transaksie op die 30ste dag. En dis hoekom ons vandag nog in besigheid is.\nSo ja, dit is 'n skrikwekkende situasie. Maar ek glo te veel hieraan.\nMoet dit nooit laat misluk nie en ek sal uitkom daarvan. Jy wil nie regtig gee nie\nmeer as 5% hier styg. Ek bedoel Ek waardeer die waarde wat 'n haai\nbring na die tafel. Goed, kyk, Ek sal jou 'n aanbod maak wat lyk\nOp hierdie manier. Ek gee jou die $ 500, 000 vir 5%. Egter\nEk word 'n tanti\u00e8me betaal totdat ek 1 verhaal, 000,\n000 dollar en dan gaan daardie koninklikes Weg. En dan die enigste onderhandeling\nons moet h\u00ea, is hoeveel dit koninklikes moet wees. Ek wil dit graag h\u00ea\nom $ 5 per eenheid te wees. Ek stel nie baie belang in 'n\nkoninklikes net omdat ek elke enkele dollar om te groei\nOp hierdie manier. Dis belaglik. Ons weet nie eens nie\nwat dit kos en ons weet nie wat hulle kos om te maak. Kevin\nOp hierdie oomblik die produkkoste is $ 36 en dan is die\ngrondkoste is 47, en ons verkoop dit vir tussen 1:50\nen 190. Jy het genoeg plek vir 'n $ 5 koninklikes. Dit is nie 'n probleem nie.\nEk doen maar ek wil eerder h\u00ea dat $ 5 gaan\nna groei. Jy weet nog nie, Haley. Hoekom wag jy nie om te sien hoe nie\nbaie ander aanbiedinge wat jy kry? OK, Haley, laat ek die bal hier aan die gang kry. Ek\ndink jy is die tipe mens wat jy weet nie wat jy nie weet nie. Seker.\nDie belangrikste deel van die bou 'n besigheid. Hou dit in lyn en jy\nrek elke bok nege verskillende maniere om te sien waaruit jy sal kom\nDit. En ek voel soos ons is. As ek dit doen, bedoel ek,\nEk weet ons het 'n ho\u00eb brandwond, maar soos ek genoem het,\nEk het nie oormatige bokoste nie. Jy het oormatige bokoste. Jy is\nbrand $ 90, 000 per maand. Jy maak twee groot en 'n\ndie helfte, $ 1,000, 000 en jy het drie maande oor\nvoordat jy buite werking is. Ek sou s\u00ea dis belangrik. Ek kannie\nNeem 'n kans op jou besigheid daardie berge saam met jou klim.\nSo ek is jammer, nie OK. Dankie. Ja. Haley,\njy het $ 150, 000 se voorraad. Dit gaan oor\n$ 500, 000 se inkomste. Dis 'n ander\n5 1/2 maande van oorlewing, wat jou dan toelaat om meer te skep\nkontantvloei om meer voorraad in te bring. As jy vir my ges\u00ea het dit is waar ons is\nBy Ek gaan hierdie skoene verkoop omdat ek\nmoet my aandag hierop vestig Dinge. Om daardie skoene te verkoop,\ndit sou 'n ander storie wees. Maar dis nie waar jy is nie. So vir\ndaardie redes oor. OUKEI Dankie vir jou tyd. Haley. Jy\nis merkwaardige jong vrou. Maar die produk bekommer my 'n bietjie.\nDit het baie vreemd gevoel om op te loop. So Ek weet nie of ek geloop het nie\nverskeie blokke in die stad New York, Byvoorbeeld, tussen vergaderings,\nas dit regtig iets sou wees dit sou vir my gemaklik wees. Ek\nWeet jy gaan 'n sukses wees in die lewe. Dit word ek nie 100% verkoop nie. Ek wens\njy die beste geluk, maar ek is uit. Dankie. Ek waardeer dit. So\nHaley, Ek dink dit is slim. Dit is 'n goeie\nIdee. Dit is wonderlik vir QVC. Ek dink jy hou van miskien dink ek dit is goed\nkwaliteit, maar 500,000 vir 5% dit is net nie genoeg vir my en ek nie\nmoenie dink 500, 000 gaan genoeg wees vir jou. Dankie. Alle paaie lei terug na mnr. Ek wed jou, Haley,\nas jy kon teruggaan en as jy kon dinge anders gedoen het,\njy sou h\u00ea. En nou is jy 90 dae weg van die vergetelheid. Jou\nprobleem is verkope. Dis die enigste ding wat jou gaan red. Maar\nhoe meer jy verkoop, hoe meer kapitaal jy vasmaak\nVoorraad. Dis die vloek van die skoenbedryf. Jy het geld nodig. Ek\nhet dit, maar ek gaan myself in 'n\nvoorkeur posisie. Ek wil regtig nie 'n koninklike doen nie.\nSoos ek aan my genoem het, 'n Koninklike gaan net baie wees\nteenproduktief vir die befondsing van groei en dit plaas my in 'n voorkeur\nposisie sodat ek nie mislei word in Vergetelheid. Ek wil graag teenwerk met\n500,000. Vir 8%. Nee. As hier geen koninklikes is nie\nherwin my kabinet, Koninklikes maak jou nie dood as jy draai nie\njou voorraad vinnig. Merk Ek sien nie jy skryf 'n tjek nie.\nDit is die enigste ooreenkoms wat daar is Op hierdie oomblik\nen ek dink nie hy sal sleg wees nie. Nee\nEk sal dit waarskynlik dra hakke in die hemel voor ek my 500 gekry het,\n000 terug. Hoe gaan dit met ons om 'n koninklike te doen teen $ 2.50 totdat u 500 kry,\n000 terug? Kyk, ek gee om vir 500 000,\ndis nie tjommie verandering nie. Is jy Oop vir enige soort toonbank?\nJy kan alles teenwerk wat jy wil, maar ek word nie te\u00ebgewerk nie. En kom nou,\njy het ges\u00ea dat jy dit verander het jaar en ewe skielik die hart\nin jou liggaam oorgeplant. Ek waardeer dit baie dat u my help\nmet hierdie ooreenkoms, Lori. So vir jou s\u00ea ek nee. My aanbod\nis baie eenvoudig. Dit is $ 5 per eenheid totdat Ek verhaal $ 1,000,\n000 en ek wil die 5% ekwiteit h\u00ea en ek is die enigste haai. Dit maak van jou 'n aanbod. Is jy oop vir 'n groter belegging?\nNo 500 is genoeg. Ek sal jou bewaar gaan vir nog ongeveer ses maande. En jy is nie oop vir 'n ander nie\ntanti\u00e8me struktuur? Nee. As u vyf aanbiedinge hier gehad het,\nmyne sou nie die een wees wat jy sou h\u00ea nie Kies. Maar jy doen nie. Sou u die $ 500 doen,\n000 teen 5% met 'n tanti\u00e8me van $ 3 betaal terug na die miljoen? Nee. Met alle respek,\nEk dink nie ons gaan 'n handel vandag. Ek waardeer al u tyd baie\nen die terugvoer. Dankie. Goeie geluk, Haley. Dit is my baba. Ek het elke\nenkele stukkie van myself hierin vir die afgelope vier jaar. En ek sal dit elke dag aanhou doen\ntotdat ons kom waar ek weet ons kan Gaan. Enige belegger wat sy sien, gaan\nom hierna te kyk en te s\u00ea: Wag \u2019n sekonde\njy is 90 dae weg van die vergetelheid. Jy weet\nsy sal jou dalk verras.

", "The Aqua Boxing Glove": "next up is a product to take your workouts to the next level [Music] wow hello sharks my name is Tony The Black Stallion adeniron from Houston Texas and my ask is a hundred thousand dollars for ten percent of my business the aqua boxing glove but before I start I need to prep for one of Mr Wonderful royalty debt deals I know how you like to roll [Music] as a professional boxer for the last 16 years I've been hitting the heavy bag and cracking scores in the ring as a result I lost four years in my professional box in Prime due to hand injuries from the constant impact I knew there had to be a better way to train so I created the aqua boxing gloves the aqua boxing gloves are the only boxing gloves in the world that do not require heavy bag or impact to get an intense Dynamic resistance workout and they're so simple to use all you have to do is add water strap them up and you're ready to train wow wow wow I'm talking improving speed cardio [Music] not to mention burn fat and build muscle it's the total body training tool all in one most of all you can train anywhere anytime without the annoying bag and change Just Add Water baby it's the Bachelor of all boxing gloves now who's ready to sweat this is heavy yes how much does this weigh so when it's empty it weighs about 2.5 pounds but you can fill it up as heavy as six pounds so the hard question is how do you get the second one on when you're by yourself boxes would just bite that velcro strap and Kevin should know I see them on Instagram boxing all the time so all the all the gloves that are pretty much the same size yes so my goal is you know within investment today we can go ahead and create a different size so right now this is for the average size hand to the larger hand I want to do one that's for average to the smaller size hand you know I honestly I feel myself getting faster already oh my God I'm gonna flash back and I had a flashback so what do you sell these for and what do they cost you to make so I'm going to be selling them for 199 dollars so you're not selling them yet yes so I'm not selling them yet we just launched a Kickstarter last month we did 40 000 in sales with minimal marketing and what did you sell them for in Kickstarter and have you delivered them yet on Kickstarter we did them for 99 um and we have not delivered them yet I went ahead and took some samples and tested them on athletes and my regular Fitness clients because I own a boxing gym so I have them just cycle through and test them and test them to give me any reason why somebody would need to return them get our hand sizes down and all that good stuff Tony what do they cost to make so they cost us right now fifty dollars to make and we can get this cost down another 30 percent when we get volume up and we get more molds to me there is some satisfaction I would think in hitting a bag right like that feeling of like it's a hassle it's a hassle to get a bag set up in your house or you got to go to a gym so I was going to say yeah it's a workout it's a workout for sure and what I think I think that this is more of a fitness product right for the boxing trainer actual boxer right this is more about the person that wants to work out that comes from boxing without having access to set heavy bags like a weight bar or something 100 so what's your background how did you get involved in this yeah so you know I'm a first generation American my parents came from Nigeria to give us a better life it was actually very hard for me to transitioning into becoming a boxer because you know when you come from overseas and you have you know people who immigrate and give up everything to get here they don't want to see you taking major risks so my parents are like you're crazy you know they're they're seeing backyard fighting on TV and they're thinking that's what I'm doing speaking of boxing you said that you actually have a boxing gym it's a business yes now those kinds of businesses got wiped out during the pandemic what happened to yours so we we took a big hit last year was one of the toughest years in business and personally that I've ever had uh you know when the pandemic hit my gym shut down so I pivoted my business I started driving from house to house going to my clients you know I would stand at the bottom of the driveway and I'd be calling out one two is combinations all that good stuff you know and every day I would watch my clients I was like I I gotta figure something out because even if I wanted to travel with that I couldn't even if I had a truck I mean it so that's where I came up with that this product was born out of the pandemic that's basically what happened you know Tony I love the hustle I see that I get it but in your guy if anybody's going to do it I'm trying to figure out you know when I do a shark tank deal where can I add the leverage this is not a product category that I have momentum in anywhere that's the only reason I'm not doing this I'm out I completely understand I appreciate the respect you know you're right in the beginning you have a lot farther to go you're going to get there but there's so many things I don't know that it's not the right investment for me I wish you good luck I'm sorry I'm out thank you that's all right look I like the product the challenge is as a sole proprietorship what's your business you don't have to scale a lot right you could sell a thousand of these at 200 bucks a pop every quarter and make good money right and that's a good business that's not a good investment right because in order to get it to scale it's going to take a lot of money a lot of packaging and you're not close to that yet so for those Reasons I'm out okay I appreciate it so this is my cup of tea I feel like it's not my baliwick at all so simply because of my lack of knowledge I am out I totally understand thank you Tony I mean look the hustle behind it amazing um I gotta be honest man you know boxing is always about the experience for me it's always about the feeling of oh my God I'm in there I'm hitting something whether it's the mitts whether it's the bag one question if you have the train right now I know you love boxing and you travel a lot how would you train right now I'm going to shadow box why not travel with those gloves for me to go and and take this with me and strap up and then say okay you know now I'm ready this seems like a lot okay that's just that's me you can get a better workout with those in 15 minutes than you could with Shadow Boxing in one hour I can see a guy like you personally I could see a guy like you leading the charge on this if you put these gloves on I can see a million other people putting these gloves on Tony why not if I can't passionately speak on your product then I'm not the right partner your partner should be able to stand side by side with you and match your level of energy if I can't do that then I'm of no value to you I'm not the right partner for you in this particular space understood that's why I'm out okay I appreciate it good luck Tony so much man all right good luck Tony it starts definitely missing opportunity but it is what it is I'm going to continue I'm a fighter That's What fighters do you get knocked down you get back up but I don't even feel like I got knocked down today

chicken coops and this is my pal Chuckles all right Chuckles you get in there lay me some eggs would you all right shark it's no secret America is crazy for backyard chickens right now families want more sustainable living and self-reliance and they love having fresh organic eggs every day plus backyard chickens bring joy to families as kids and grandkids make lifelong memories caring for these adorable pets that's why we created over easy chicken coops our proprietary modular coups are easy to ship and easy to assemble all you need is is 30 minutes a screw gun and two people to assemble your over easy Coupe we offer four different sizes that perfectly accommodate between five and 20 chickens America is so cuckoo for these CPS that we can hardly keep up with the demand we're chickens running around with our heads cut off sorry Chuckles sharks I need a partner so I can finally stop having all my eggs in one basket so who wants to acquire 4% of OV easy chicken CPS for an investment of $1 million tell us why this is worth2 he's only four points away from for zero first of all our IP is locked down and the cash register is ringing and we've only just begun we are on a path to become the category King for backyard chickens in America and with your help maybe or anybody else who's interested we will expand to Europe where the interest in backyard chickens is even stronger than in the United States Chad you're one crazy chicken what are these are we supposed to open these can I just say I opened the egg I was all excited thinking I was going to get something wonderful it wonder I mean it's nice it's a little brochure it talks about quick facts about your business there is some golden information in there okay so how much have you sold oh you want numbers I got numbers this week we surpassed 21 million in sales wow lifetime last Lifetime and year to date 9 million year to date 9 million and best of all 1.35 million in profit which if you do the math you know our EBA is 15% it should have been 18 why wasn't it because of the supply chain issues that we had lumber prices you know went up fourfold true um Chad I was not expecting those kind of numbers how are you selling 9 million ah it breaks my heart we were not ready Co it spiked big time and we had the frustrating situation where we could not fill orders we did not have enough coups got it so we missed out on millions of dollars in sales despite that 6.8 million in sales last year how much did you net on that well last year was about 12% so going from 6.8 to9 through 6 months is a big step M right what do you even doing what am I oh yeah what are you looking at oh I was trying to make sure I cover everything and we go ahead and make sure there we go I'm sorry so how are you paying for all this inventory I am here to raise money for more inventory we're going to need it but have you raised money and who are your partners and how much of your company do you still own I Own 100% actually I bought the company last June 30th and that's when I owned 68% I didn't tell you I'm from the Amish Country in Pennsylvania oh but back to your question about Co we missed the co bump last year could have been well over 10 million if we hadn't had enough coups I'd like to go back to the numbers just give me the last three years in Revenue 2019 was 2.2 million 2020 was 6.8 million wow this year we'll probably do 20 million you got a big ramp going in here that takes Capital cuz there's a there's a cap EX to this business you got to make this stuff how did you raise the money so I had to do creative Finance to support the POS and receivables we were able to borrow against all the POS that we had it all worked out great in the second quarter paid everyone back but now we're facing much greater opportunity along those lines and that's one of the challenging things about this business Chad I got to understand some basic things so number one I don't know what that costs the large is $18.99 the medium is $4.99 and the small is $10.99 our overall gross profit margins are about 36% So Co did have a heavy imp so on the one hand you said it had a negative effect on you because you didn't have supply chain we missed out but you didn't miss out that's right uh all right well you get what I'm saying you are suggesting that I was uh inconsistent in my answer here's the thing yes we missed the co bump I I swear we could have sold 3 4 million more last year when we did 6.8 million could have been 10 if we would had enough coups but now we have a factory set up in Lancaster County Pennsylvania we have one down in Dublin Georgia Central Georgia and in Colorado so we can hit the whole whole uh country so I would like you to answer for me in two sentences why Europe would want your Coupe more than the coups they have over there most of what's available in Europe and in the United States are frankly cheap Imports and we came up with with this beautiful Coupe in a box and it is selling big time and already 700 units have sold but back to Europe what we know is that in Europe they have backyard chickens more but you're wondering how is it that we could compete in that market same as here well no I I said in two sentences I mean just being fair when you're selling something you need to be able to tell people in a couple of sentences what it is and why it's great it's a knockdown high quality Coupe quality is great but it's not a strong enough differentiator and unfortunately I have to be out what is the lifespan of a chicken 5 to 10 years my fear with going into business with you is it is going to take me longer than the lifespan of a chicken to find out the details of your business now before you go out I got to talk to you about Europe you didn't have me over here with Europe you you really catapulted me in into not interest tell the most valuable thing in my life is my time I don't want to spend it learning about your business I'm out okay Chad let me take a stab at it all right I love Revenue I think your presentation uh was a little wandering do you think but you got a lot of Revenue here I'll make you an offer um I'll give you the million bucks in debt cuz you need Capital I'll take the 4% equity and I want to pay back over 3 years the average right now is 112% that Capital will let you do what you want to do stat side I don't know what you're talking about in Europe but that's your decision I don't control the business but that's an offer at least you can peck on that one all right million bucks and you know the added bonuses you get Mr Wonderful the shark which could really help blow this business up big time because I just love chicken I like it with cream sauce I like it roasted oh stop Che um you're already cash constrained to Kevin point and now you want to go out and effectively have to build factories around the world stared in Europe because you can't just ship everything over there and somebody's going to have to make them so you have the capital expense of doing that a million dollars whether it's debt or Equity isn't going to allow you to keep up with your growth I think you're coming in talking overseas and Europe because you think that sounds good to us I don't think you've really projected it out so for those reasons amounts you know Chad I you're asking a million for 4% I think we all know here that as you said materials have just been brutal yeah that's the problem I think your margins are going to shrink well the materials came down yeah they did yep it's all settled now they've come way down I don't think it settled our our margins will go up I believe the materials will still go up and I don't like your valuation so what valuation would make you comfortable cuz I'm here to help you make money Damon that's a good offer throw out a number 25% are you making an offer yeah million doll 25% uh let me see you three are out yes and you have a real offer I'm bringing you back in let let me explain may I have 2 minutes to please explain something I don't speak to Robert's out I know but I I got to tell him something no please don't you should be talking to why are you here you're doing exactly what he said you're making it confusing scaring us Dam it I want to hear what he was going to say go ahead Chad bear with me I have gone to Europe many times because we were looking at expanding our business over there so next week I'm flying to Prague and if they are interested there's there's this amazing folks and by the way in the Czech Republic and in each just want to say one thing okay one thing I can actually speak chicken those chickens are saying right now Chad why don't you get focused on the two offers okay if had are talking to a guy that's been out for 15 minutes I'm going to have to counter on yours I want both guys I'd love to say yes to Mr Wonderful there in terms of the debt doesn't bother me because we're so profitable but I need to ask you one question yeah there might be another million or two that we need in po support that the banks won't give me I understand my answer is always the same to every entrepreneur I support all my companies okay our interests are aligned I want you to succeed the answer is of course if you actually come in with business that makes sense and I can make more money with my 4% I'm going to support you that's what I do with all my entrepreneurs you know I'm not in love with your European strategy I don't get it there's there's so much opportunity States side yeah particularly since you need cash for POS right you're not going to have any money left over for European expansion Chad I I I ask you not to entertain him which you know you're you're a grown man you can do whatever you want but you have two offers on the table and you just keep getting distracted and I just got to say that I think that is exactly what it's going to be in business with you so I like you but I'm out well then it's just the two of us Mr Wonderful is right for now for now do you want to get together in this or not Mr Wonderful I want to say yes to your offer as long as you are going to support the other POS I'm not guaranteeing you that right now cuz I don't know enough about your income statement and balance sheet but I told you I support my companies the offer I'm making you right now is the million dollar oh no I'm accepting that we have a deal well then forget all the rest of them noise the what yeah are you done I just wanted to talk with Robert a little bit about our designs in Eastern Europe get I want to come back in come on let me talk to him wait a second don't you want someone from Europe who has a passion for helping create jobs he's not really from Europe he's been here a very long time here very long is alen f around here is this Candy Camera what's going on all right if you say so but Robert come on I wanted us to do special things in Europe we could even I'm with you Chad I'm out oh really I said yes though I Kevin yes thank you you do not understand when a guy offers you a million dollars but then you start talking to got this out I was the only shark to offer you a million dollars the only one that was going to find your business after everybody else dropped out and then you say oh no I want to talk to Robert about czechslovakia no that is that I just want to have that I said yes to you no I'm out I'm out you got to go Chad Good Luck Good Luck Chad well thank you and I hope that uh you'll enjoy backyard chicken someday if you want this have a good day bye Chad well

Angeles California today we're seeking $750,000 in exchange for 5% of the company okay when I met Kenton College he was studying neuroscience and training with a Japanese Olympic jeto team and Ryan was studying chemistry and was captain of the cross country and track team he's a second degree black Bel in karate and he's finished 12 marathons he's also an artist that's done over 40 murals around the world and he trains with the US paralympic team I guess if there's one word to describe us it would be more more more look we like to push each other but sometimes you just need that little extra boost coffee is great but it doesn't fit in your pocket and you don't want to be running around with it oh and don't get me started on energy drinks we wanted clean balanced energy something that can be taken anytime anywhere so that's why we created neurog gum and neurom mints for when you need just a little more using a patented cold compressed method we Ed a blend of natural caffeine plus eleanine and b6 and b12 vitamins in each piece each piece contains as much caffeine as half a cup of coffee and since you absorb it through your mouth it works way faster than drinks or supplements but what about the sugar oh ill no GMOs nope all right but is it vegan yeah of course it is wow it really is better than a cup coffee and 1/10th the price so sharks wake up don't get yourself stuck in a sticky situation now who wants to chew on some neural gum and neuro mints bring it on let's do it bring it on all right there you go it's the mints on the top and cinnamon and mint flavor G on the bottom what do he want us to try first try the mint sliding tin one how long does it take to be effective 5 to 10 minutes are you already in stores we are in stores 5,500 locations tell us a little B about your background when I was in college I was basically training four to 5 hours a day trying to balance school with my social life and my training was extremely difficult so I was mixing supplements in my own room and obviously we have chemists and formulators now but to refine it but that was essentially vzero of neurogum where did you meet Ryan I met Kent in Japanese class uh we automatically just hit it off and then we became best friends and uh in 2009 uh I was 19 years old and I got into a really bad snowboarding accident and doctors told me I would never walk again I spent the next 2 years and 15 surgeries in the hospital uh I think that was definitely the lowest point in my life and fortunately I had the best friends family in the world that helped me get back to where I wanted to be you know K I just wanted to live more we wanted to do everything that life had to offer and that was really the Catalyst to start Nur gum you know that life can change in a millisecond to you I mean that is just so impressive I'm just trying to live life to the best well here you are in Shark Tank that's not bad so based on your valuation you must be doing a lot of business we could do much better but we have been doing a fantastic job this year we're coming up to about four years from starting launching the company uh this year we'll do about 3.5 million in sales wow we just entered retail 3.5 million in sales this year what did you do last year was yeah was uh about 1.5 million bam for the first three and a half years of the business we only focused on online and um Amazon so about 33% of our customers in the last 12 months on our website have bought again and on Amazon is about 21% so the people who try our product really love it Ryan I got to tell you I am so freaking hyp right now let's go take you on in Judo deal deal deal so listen walk me through your distribution because the danger with Rising sales is that they may mask repeat sales Daniel there is a big reason why we're here because retail is terrifying and I think we need that markting prowess the ad allowances the Shelf talk all those things that kind of come like it's crazy so we're in 5,000 of the largest of the largest farmacy chain in the United States we're the number two bestselling product in memory focus in CVS so we retail the product for about 3.95 3.99 and and it cost us 67 cents to make the neurog and neurom mints and so our gross margins are high what is your sales in just CVS it's close to half a million so far I'm assuming you're going to tell me you're going to do 5 million next year I think we could do 10 million because we have uh two large POS lined up with two two of the largest airline companies it's Delta and JetBlue so guys some advice I want to give you because you can grow yourself out of business if you're not cautious here you can have an airline get very excited try one order you go really fast and before you know they don't reorder you just need to be careful with your growth I love your authenticity you remind me of my father because people that survived the Holocaust the overwhelming majority of they could not talk back about their past and my dad found a way to talk about everything he went through but to always be kind to always be thankful and to always see the positive and I just see that in you but it's just not a category that I feel I can connect to enough I'm out but I love everything about you guys I wish you the very very best thank you so much Daniel we look up to you a tremendous amount and what you've done with kind bar and you are like an inspiration to us yeah okay boys no more Kumbaya 750,000 what are you doing with the money uh so the $750,000 is going to go into the marketing efforts in retail because marketing guys why are you even talking about retail you have a proven model why are you worth $15 million because most cpg companies right now have been have been getting acquired at 3 to 10x multiple on Topline revenue and that's what we're calculating on but that doesn't have to do with where you're at right now okay here's my challenge with it the value of this company would have to grow by so much for me to make any money at my 5% right I think what we're we're just getting started on the retail and I think back to your point why why don't we start just stay as an online business is we want to really make this into a national brand takes a lot of money to do that my friend absolutely we're trying to go from product to Lifestyle though that's why we're spending our money into sampling and events because that way we could connect with people look you put yourself at risk when you sample you are a supplement that that's making claims you talk about Clarity you talk about energy you talk about focus and so when people see that that's what they're expecting and that's what they're hoping for even though you as a neuroscientist knows no two people are going to experience it the exact same way so if you sample you put yourself at significant risk so for those Reasons I'm out thanks Mark listen what you have achieved and overcome I mean there's no end to what you'll do but for me right now I'm kind of like this when I'm like that I have to say I'm out so you know for me there is a massive gaping hole of how are you going to scale this but love you guys love the success so far for what I know I'm willing to take a flyer on it I'll give you a million dollars for 20% it's a flyer I think your valuation is stinky poo poo it's ridiculous but I like the premise of the business I prefer the vertical aspect to it that you found your Market that business alone could be good here's my offer I'll give you 750 I want 50 cents in royalties off every unit till I recoup a million dollars and I want the 5% Equity now oh my Lord thank you for that offer going to respond to you Robert first um do you want to meet halfway at 10 million valuation I'd go up to a 7 million valuation we can't we couldn't do seven I'm so sorry we can't we can't do that it would just yeah I think it would be unfair for the other investors that came in they're not sharks no but they they are an extension of our are expensive my friend look it's not your family they're investors and I think I think I bring more value I mean I love you guys but I can't do it that that right I'm out okay apprciate well then all roads lead back to Mr Wonderful as usual and they all have potholes what do you want to do oh I I don't think we can take your deal Kevin you're making a big mistake my friend guys thank you very much luck those were great guys love you dude love you too well we're all about more and more and more and the Sharks definitely wanted more more tooo much more more more more more more more before you go don't forget to subscribe to the Shark Tank Youtube channel and ring the notification Bell to keep up with everything that's bubbling in the tank ", "CUPBOP": "[Music] first in the tank is a convenient version of a popular cuisine [Music] sure we are pumped to be here my name is Doc my name's John and we're from [Music] Jung what is Kabob cup up

lot of different food Concepts on Shark Tank I have to give it to you this is one of the best I've ever tried yeah that's big coming from Kevin guys what's the cost of this it ranges anywhere from about eight dollars to ten dollars per bowl and what does it cost you a dollar eighty to 250 so our our gross margin is about 75 and you gave us an astronomical number here you said three percent you wanted a million dollars your sales must be through the roof let's hear it our trailing 12 months system wide um sales is 18.7 million dollars oh and wow are you kidding how many trucks so we actually we started from a food truck now the trucks are more of a marketing tool for us um brick and mortar stores we right now have 27 stores how many years have you been in business about eight years tell us congratulations the sales the trajectory I want to know how you got to 18 million going back the last kind of five years we were seven million 8 million nine Mills so we were growing about a million each and last year we did right around 10 and a half million and this year we're expected to grow 90. during a covid year when people were not going out to restaurants so how did you do that did only take out um delivery and delivery and our same store sales we were up nine percent during Kobe so that worked better for you actually yeah doc what's your background yeah so previous to this I was an investor at a major hedge fund actually he was my first customer in Salt Lake City downtown he came to me hey moved to New York did my kind of eight seven eight years there and I I just wanted something different did you go and Pitch him on being his partner he called that's right I called him up if you're not hiring me right now you're gonna be regret for the Futures who owns the business and what percentage so we own half of the business oh so you've raised a lot of money then the other half his co-founders um okay and a group came in and just bought Equity off of the other three Partners what did they pay for that Equity what valuation undisclosed we don't know yeah basically they took the money in rent so we've actually so we've been growing through organic cash flow we've never raised money but during covid you pivoted right instead of having people go to the stores you said you were doing delivery business you killed it last year why do you need us the reason why it's not only about the food we want to give you a really good experience with our customer we high five all the time we hugging we're dancing together Korean people as a party people they didn't play you said you hadn't raised any money why didn't you bring in any I say no for eight years because I think I can make it 2 000 store with you guys I want to be the first Korean national brand with the sharks when I came here for a long time ago from Korea I'm not good students in Korea I got eighth grade all my life they call me I'm the failure I'm the loser but when I came to United States I found opportunity here if I work hard here I can make a dream come here this is a big thing for me not because of money I want to get the opportunity to tell them hey first Korean national brand here so John we heard all about you fabulous story I love it but doc I want to hear a little bit about you I was born in Korea and when I was 11 my family came on a summer vacation in the U.S and the day before we're supposed to fly back my mom and dad sent me down and my older brother and said oh by the way we didn't tell you but you guys are not coming back with us oh um what so they had planned this all along so they found a family a school and they thought that if they told us we we wouldn't want to come and so they did it the hard way the next day bam oh my god wow and they chose Utah because they just heard that Utah was a religious state that a lot of people don't smoke and drink they they thought oh that's got to be safe doc I mean that story is incredible why do you think your parents did that why did they drop you off in America it was really for the opportunity absolute best decision that they've ever made for us and I am just forever grateful for what what they've been it's amazing how the people who grew up here don't feel the same way think about what your parents sacrificed for the American dream I now only can I really start understanding my parents a little bit now that I have my own kids and the love that I have for them he got two kids I got five kids wow how do you work maybe that's why you work so hard but my wife supported me 100 I I love this story like you guys my dad gave up everything to come here I had to freaking be successful to justify that sacrifice and you guys are on to something here purpose comes through everything except one million dollars for three percent I don't know what the purpose of that is what is a 30 million evaluation 33 million I how do I how do I how do I get there it's it's it's really the growth rate it took us seven years to get to 10 million we have 10 more stores coming before the end of the year I like the deal I like the mission I like the energy I love the food and I like the cash flow okay I'm gonna make you an offer so here's the deal I'm going to loan you the million dollars I'm going to put a 10 interest rate on it it's 36 months amortization three years and I'm going to take the three percent as a warrant so I get Equity I get three percent I put all I can bring to it is Chef wonderful and all the rest of that stuff and you have a shark tank here guys can guys counts and sales but I also have to tell you the idea that you were done in school like I was it's interesting to me after 13 years on Shark Tank every one of my top 10 business owners Founders were terrible in school isn't that interesting it's interesting when they get into the workplace boy oh boy are they smart so I believe in you but it's too rich I'd have to have 30 for one million dollars all right laugh at it if you want okay but my Sharp thinking on how I remodel all my businesses have made them much more money than that all along the way you have two offers are there any other offers the product is fantastic I think the business is worth about 18 million today you're asking for 33. I want to own a bigger piece but that's simply a function of money you're asking for a million for three percent I'll give you 5 million for 28 oh which is an 18 million valuation wow I mean that's what I think the business is worth today listen I love your model and I just want to take the journey with you I would give you a million dollars as a loan eight percent interest five percent equity hey guys if it's just the cash you're looking for I would give you a million dollar loan for five percent no problem I'll do it for three percent and I'll work on the finance you know what I'd do it with Barbara if Barbara wants to do it with me I would love to do it I haven't done a deal with your dogs that's right we haven't so Lori and I will give you five percent for a million dollar loan will go in together okay so Mark what are you doing first I love the business I love the product I love the fact that you can make it a healthy alternative but what I'm hearing and tell me if I'm wrong you've got the operations down right but you need someone to propel you in terms of marketing and PR and just to be able to have a national presence so when people talk about cup up then people say yeah I know it and I think I can provide that better than anybody because I do have that National platform and and I can get word out there better but at the same time what I would do is a million dollars just straight Equity I'd like seven percent and my commitment is though I can help you just scale this thing in terms of visibility and PR my portfolio was full of all kinds of healthy alternatives so that's my offer one million dollars for seven percent let me tell you what's wrong with Mark's plan this his appreciation your business is lovely but it's wrong this is not a healthy alternative this is a delicious alternative yeah this is not a healthy Brand This is a fun brand you know and I'm not saying you turn it into a health store at all right what I'm saying is you can extend your customers right and he said he could create the publicity we all can create the publicity too what are you going to do foreign would you be able to do one million straight equity for four and a half percent I'd go five and a half percent is my lowest I'm not cheap [Music] guys five percent one million equity for five percent with the other partners we kind of set the parameters I just don't know what's going to happen if we autonomously [Music] all right I'll do five percent yes yes [Music] only because of those other partners thank you guys so much thank you thank you good luck guys thank you do the dance again do the dance America is truly the land of opportunity yes I mean I 100 agree with it it's a huge milestone for us and so I I could honestly not be happier right now we can go to moon right that's right let's go to Moon ", "Sanaia Applesauce": "next in the tank is a more sophisticated version of a traditional snack [Music] hi sharks my name is Keisha Jeremy and my company is Sanaya applesauce I'm asking for a hundred and fifty thousand dollars for 15 in my company now sharks have you ever noticed that the entire applesauce industry has been completely ignoring us they're focused on eight-year-olds and they're focused on 80 year olds and they're leaving a ton of money on the table because think about it if you're an adult and you're looking for applesauce on shelves the options are really Slim basically they've been asking us for to settle for baby food all these years Baby Food flavors baby food consistency and now pouches sharks I am a grown woman I am not doing pouches and so I finally decided to take matters into my own hands introducing Sanaya I've taken organic green apples and curated six island inspired flavors I've also done something else that no one else has thought of in every jar you'll find baked apple wedges today you're meeting the woman who's about to take the entire applesauce category by storm when the yogurt industry finally started listening to adults and gave them a snack that they actually deserve that eight billion dollar category turned into 125 billion dollars so what I'm about to do is take these green apples and turn them into billions of green dollars who's coming with me so I also have some samples for you yes I love applesauce thank you so these are four of our six flavors thank you thanks Keisha appreciate it the guava is good guava yep the plain Apple's delicious on the unsweetened version good it doesn't taste processed right and are you in the market today or is this brand new so this is so we just launched in July we did a test market for six months direct to Consumer and what are your sales today so we achieved forty thousand dollars of sales in that six month test pilot there are people buying it because they're like the flavor or do you see it as a health food well they're buying it because a lot of people are looking for plant-based right they're looking to move away from dairy and if it's vegan vegans actually bake with applesauce instead of eggs Keisha how do you sell it and what is the cost the glass jar is going to be our product on Amazon Prime it's going to be sold as a four pack of flavors the glass jar is a dollar three and 3.99 per jar to right so 399 times four so effectively sixteen dollars at retail and your cost is four dollars and 12 cents is that not expensive stuff for applesauce so again you know we're not comparing ourselves to mats as I mentioned in the opening this is essentially what Chobani did with yogurt right they took a category that was pretty sleepy and they elevated the flavors they elevated the positioning they elevated the packaging we just spent the last 48 hours at the iddba conference or trade show and we came back with close to 35 million dollars and projected Revenue based on interest please I'm not buying it Keisha well I'll tell you wait wait tell us give her a chance I'll tell you so Starbucks Whole Foods Sam's Club BJ's Krogers literally buyers sending other buyers to us they're referring to using orders right well it's not a it's not an order taking conference but before the trade show we'd already had a commitment with Whole Foods a test with Whole Foods Whole Foods in Harlem so one store one store what I heard was 35 million dollars so how did you get there how do you why do you say that if we look at everything was going great till I heard that so what happened basically is we had a number of buyers come to us did you get a firm order from anybody we have not received firm orders from them but they what we received is basically confirmed interest they came by they basically said no one else is doing this this immediately belongs in our refrigerated section actually I want to show you the pictures so this is they're putting it into a yogurt yeah could you can we see that oh so this is a new product so this is the product that we've been talking about that's a better idea sell the same flavors what's your background I'm currently a global head of HR for one of the largest publishing companies in the country which one uh News Corp news corporation wow so I've been there for music off on the side and I've been doing it but I also I've been building high performance teams for 20 years and so I immediately knew that I needed to build a team to do this so you're not going to go full time into this well at this moment it doesn't make sense for me to be full-time but I have a CEO who literally is minutes away from our production plan and this is his full-time job did you raise a lot of money it sounds expensive I have been self-funding it so far 250 000 wow is what I've spent so far it seems to me like you got very far for 250 000. this product versus this product what's your plan for this the glass jars will be on Amazon Prime in two weeks that's horrible well you're launching that the glass jar is in two weeks on Amazon why are you the shipping cost is going to be enormous so the weight of the glass is the same as the liquid inside well we're able to make close to 50 margins on the glasses this is 63 cents to make 63 cents to make but to sell to sell will be um a dollar a dollar to wholesale and then we're thinking about this is the most expensive applesauce ever sold in America I guess what I would respond to in that is the person who buys mats today is not really our consumer so here's the problem I'm having I see where you're going right right create a new category this is going to be hard if not impossible to sell because you're not an established brand now this on the other hand if it's a grab and go why are you complicating it with this well so we this is where we started for me it's really super basic it's how popular is applesauce for adults I'm not really an applesauce fan you know after 10 seasons sitting here going out on a person's dream is never easy and it pains me to sit here and say but I'm out that's fine I respect that t-shirt I have to tell you your presentation was very impressive until we got to the trade show okay when you confuse interest with actual orders it leaves me with doubt it's just not for me okay I'm out okay I respect that thank you I happen to think both of your products are great for a lot of reasons I don't think your price is out of line your retail is two bucks that's about right with everything else on the Shelf I thought the flavor was phenomenal and the texture of the creamy and delicious wait a minute wait a minute the major point is you're definitely a dreamer but you can't justify the dream and that's very disturbing I mean the numbers you throw out I can't believe each time you give an explanation how you're going to get there okay but there are businesses where it's worth taking a flyer on yeah you could be the next big thing but the kind of offer I'd have to make you I'm afraid I'd insult you would any offer insult you at this point I don't think any offer would insult me I'm curious to see what you think the value generation I was giving 150 000 but I would have to get at least 75 percent [Music] two sharks are out Barbara is interested in Keisha's Gourmet applesauce Sanaya but she wants a huge chunk of her company I would give you the 150 000 but I would have to get at least 75 percent by the way did that insult you didn't insult me it was just interesting okay uh well said would you like to accept my offer no that that's not an offer that we can take thank you I'm out [Music] we've been through this we've all looked at food products I'm not saying you're wrong but I'm saying it's risky it really is risky and you're not full-time which I got to tell you really bothers me if you really believe this you'd quit your job and you'd be telling me that you don't sleep on weekends I don't sleep on weekends but I'm also the breadwinner and it's not an option for everyone no I can't think for everyone no it's not everybody can do that but there's a difference I can invest in an entrepreneur that does I'm out how much cash do you have in bank so I have set aside uh close to five hundred thousand dollars for the business as I'm self-funding it right now so you put in 250 already and you have another 250 of your savings correct look you have a presence about you you know this you have a power about you what I haven't been convinced of is that you're an entrepreneur I get your bread winner you have those responsibilities that's always a push pull that people have but at the same time we all were broke I'm not convinced here's what I can tell you I didn't have to start the business if I did not see the market opportunity I would not put my life savings into it I do work around the clock it is definitely not a part-time gig in the way that that you've described it well you do work somewhere else I do work somewhere else but part-time sounds like you're checking in and checking out yes it does well I think it is but I also think that because it couldn't be my full-time job right out of the gate I put a team in place that's great you're an owner the wrist profile why aren't you throwing everything into this I cannot afford to look I think that's so unfair you think the world is fair and doing it she's not working full-time I started my first company I wanted to be all in you know what I had a mortgage I had a child at home I didn't have that choice so I have to work 24 hours a day she's not asking for Kumbaya she's just saying she has a family to support her every day they're full-time 110 so why are we like tearing up tell me is there like why are you tearing up um [Music] foreign [Music] I take care of so many people financially um this is the first thing I've ever done for myself [Music] and I would never squander uh the commitments that I have to family members if I didn't believe in it who is it that relies on you um my mom my dad my siblings um I'm the person who made it so really you're absolutely right to keep your job and take care of the people that you're taking care of and fulfill your dream on the side you're impressive and even though I think you're missing a few things I think that my team can provide it so I'll make you an offer thank you I'll give you 150k but I want 25 percent I'm comfortable doing that whoa I appreciation congratulations I'm very excited congrats congratulations foreign ", "LoveSync": "[Music] next up is a product that helps couples stay in sync [Music] hello sharks i'm jen and i'm ryan we are the founders of lovesync from cleveland ohio we're seeking a hundred thousand dollars for 10 of our company sharks imagine this you're out on a romantic date with your significant other great food a fine bottle of valerie merlot there are no distractions from enjoying each other's company i think we all know that nights like this usually finish with a happy end but what about those everyday nights when life gets in the way and sexy times often becomes a take it or leave it proposition like tonight he could be down for a little dance in the sheets but he assumes that she is exhausted from a stressful day lets the moment pass little does he know she'd be up for a quick bed boogie to unwind but she is tired and she figures it's going to take more energy than she's got tonight to distract him away from his work the reality is these types of situations play out more often than people realize what if there was a way we could know our partner's subtle desires when they're not always made obvious now there is the lovesync button lets you and your partner know when your moods are matched turning missed opportunities into more romance it works like this simply place a button at each nightstand and plug into power on those routine evenings where she's feeling a little frisky she discreetly taps her button if she's the only one who taps her partner never knows she enjoys her sleep but if he's also a tad randy he'll discreetly tap his button the lovesync technology recognizes they're both privately thinking the same thing it lets them know by emitting a swirling glow from the buttons they can now make their moves with confidence knowing their partner's good to go with lovesync couples desires are fulfilled more frequently leading to a happier relationship isn't it time for those of us already in relationships to have a little tech to help us hook up more so sharks who of you want to get in bed with us and help get the world love synced nice we're going to go ahead and excuse our couple for a little private time barbara kevin go test it all right so why did you come up with this one night i was laying there on the fence it's like if if i knew it wasn't gonna be a lot of work tonight if she's like down ready to go like i'd go for it and i don't know that's what it struck and it was just one of the ideas so so jen what do you think of this once i got it it was like a light bulb moment after using the buttons now for several months it's it's a gadget that i we don't want to get rid of we've gotten a lot of feedback from our backers who have said they didn't even realize the opportunities that they were missing until they got the butt what are your sales we made 25 000 on kickstarter and that's how many units uh that was of 400 units have you fulfilled the all the orders on kickstarter yes what do you sell it for around 60. 60. that's not bad people pay a lot more for those roses to get the same thing what are they what do they cost to make so at our first mlq of a thousand units we have 22 dollars that'll go down to 14 or less share with us your background because i is this your full-time job no no so i um i'm a chief product engineer i work on consumer robotics actually robotic lawn mowers i am uh the operations manager for a marriage and family counseling practice well that would make sense you know we know that the future in this is with mobile we are currently developing uh a mobile app i'm having a hard time with the basic premise i mean what about you two guys why don't you just talk to each other look i want some sex you in or out but here's the problem lovesync is going to make communicating romantically easier and more efficient that's what technology has done for us in all other aspects of our lives what i was sitting here thinking was the exact opposite so many people complained today that actually technology and people being on their phones and not communicating has become like overpowering and and actually a bad thing i don't see this as sexy romantic i see it as technology going too far like to a place where i feel like just communicating is so much more important i'm so sorry i don't believe in this so it is not a replacement there is some science about this our sexual desire ranges on a spectrum from ice cold like it's just not happening right now right to red hot i'm going to let you know what i'm thinking i'm going to communicate you're going to get your point across and you communicate do that are you saying the motivation is the fear of rejection yeah so this is why the app this is why we are pivoting i hate the app the hardware is there are millions of apps sitting on platforms that never get used if you have the app working right now and you put it do any of them get you more set you would have to get customers acquired that would require capital to figure out what's my customer acquisition cost whether it's this button or whether it's an app and you know i think there's a fair amount of skepticism up here about this to be honest with you i think it would work right for enough people but this is a business you haven't said anything at all about the business other that you've done a kickstarter that doesn't tell me you have anything to invest in here's the business so once we launch the app we will start growing our user base slowly at first to start get feedback and and uh ryan that's not an answer right you're stumbling all over it so then it's gonna be a subscription model because this is obviously people this is not the buttons now we're on the app that's right like i said the app is the future of this and i will tell you why that is ah so anybody out there who's thinking like that's a dumb idea what happened there's always a piece there's always gonna sell anybody you know let's try it could be fun let's see what happens you know all right you're all over the map ryan ryan you are you're you're making things more confusing ryan i'm out i just can't see you getting from point a to point b i don't think you're organized enough to make this work [Music] so here's my thought on it my favorite part of my relationship with my wife is talking crap all day about all the things i'm going to do and then i just fall asleep i don't even do it i've heard it but that's the romantic part right you know she knows that i love her she knows that i'm attracted by her and i'm like oh i'm gonna do this i'm gonna do this and she's like sure buddy you're not doing anything and that's the beautiful part about so i just don't i think it's a little too early right now for me i'm out i'm gonna give this a shot if i could okay the price point is too high the cost to make it is too high but here's the real problem with your business plan it's ryan i'm gonna tell you ryan why you're a problem you don't listen you're so in love with your idea that you're tripping over yourself to express your love again and again and you really haven't adequately answered any objection that has been raised here you you jump skipped onto your new app that's a problem because the entrepreneurs that don't listen never make it i don't care what kind of product they have in their hand and so that is the scariest thing in the world and the scariest place in the world for me to put money so sadly as much as i actually like what you've done here i'm out for that reason guys i'm sorry you did a poor job presenting i'm out good luck guys all right hello goodbye guys good luck guys thank you very much we are so excited about this product and this technology and all the ideas that we have for it i think we let that get the best of us and we weren't effective enough in communicating the plan that we actually have to do that you ", "HairFin": "thank you next in the tank is a way to save money on haircuts [Music] hello sharks my name is Tony and I'm from Derby Connecticut I'm here seeking twenty five thousand dollars for twenty percent equity in my product the hairfin Sharks as you probably already know most home haircutters rely on hair clippers to cut hair evenly these are great for cutting short hair but these Clipper Combs only go up to about an inch that's not very long you throw it into a bowl cut but they're out and the calendar cut it's not much better so if you don't want one of those you're going to need a way to cut longer hair evenly now measuring your hair as you cut it seems like an obvious solution but if you're holding your hair on one hand and you're holding a measuring tape in your other hand how are you going to cut it what we need is a modern solution to this age-old problem introducing the hair fit a measuring tool that Mouse to your hand and stays out of the way so that you can grasp hair then as you're pulling the hair straight you can slide the guide into place once the guide is in place you can go ahead and trim any hair that comes out above your hand knowing that you're cutting it the right length the hair fin is perfect for home hair cutters it comes with two three and four inch long guides so you can do a multitude of haircuts it takes the guesswork out of judging hair length because you can measure hair while holding it in place for the perfect cut so sharks who's ready to make and Shred some hair cutting waves with the hair fin tell us about you I started working when I was 14. I worked to pay my way through school computer engineering at Penn State Quakertown and when I graduated the.com bubble head burst but luckily I had done an internship at a helicopter company so I got a job there working on helicopters and I have 12 utility patents for doing research and development on helicopter flight control system so that's a perfect connected to the air fan so how did you get from here to hair fence so I also met my wife and when we got married we made a goal to retire by 2020. so after years of saving aggressively I was able to retire early congratulations thank you so now I get to work on things that I'm passionate about and part of what got me to retirement is that I'm Frugal I drive a 3 000 car wow and I also cut my own hair that worked out really good until I grew my hair out and then all of a sudden I didn't have a way to cut it even anymore and so I just had bad haircuts for a while until one night I got to think a while I gotta tell it Tony with all due respect it looks like you cut your own hair [Laughter] and I'll just measure my hair and cut it so then one night I got to thinking what I really need is something that can mount on my hand and then stay out of the way so that I can still grasp my hair and then when I'm pulling it straight I can slide it into place so the next day I made a prototype and I cut my hair for the first time in years and it was the best haircut believe it or not in years I am curious what are the sales so since I started selling them in July of 2020 we sold forty one thousand dollars wow good for you wow 25 units never thought you would you sell them for and what does it cost you to make I sell them for 14.95 on sale right now and it cost me two dollars to make them in the USA I saw them directly to Consumer online only on Amazon right now Tony I admire anybody who has a mission to retire doesn't work for money but works for freedom and life but there's a price to my time and where I put my time this is just too small for me the thing is I don't think so because we have a very broad audience I I make these for two dollars and I sell them for 14 as super scalable why do you think you haven't sold more I am an awkward engineer when it comes to marketing and sales I'm more like a dolphin than a shark so I need somebody that that knows more about marketing and also has the connections that can help me to promote this and look Tony first congratulations the most valuable asset you can ever get you've bought freedom for yourself so I commend you significantly on that but this is just not a fit for me so for those Reasons I'm out Tony a question for you guys your chances with another shark yes um and getting a deal there I'm gonna take myself out of the equation oh really Lori I'm out Tony are you worried that the two sharks that are left are follicly challenged so Tony what would motivate you before you sold any fins to take some of that money which now you supposedly have put aside for retirement and risk it starting a new basic business uh well I have a lot of hobbies making pizza I'm really good at making it and you're the main the thing is it's just it's just that a weird you know the circumstances like I like to mountain bike I like to Surf I care a little bit but not too much about my hair and I just need to get it cut the way I want to The Hairpin when you care a little bit about your hair but not too much you're like Tom you're amazing I don't have a hair problem very simple for me to cut my hair I've seen you younger you had hair you would have used one of them younger so you've got forty one thousand dollars in sales it's a fantastic margin I mean it's it's a great business but it's just I don't think it's investable I think it's terrific for you yeah I'm out Damon Damon Damon come on I like them so much and we're close by you're in New York I would love to have you come up have some pizzas get your hair cut you know Damon you know this is for you I invested into hair cutting device cut buddy he got his deal on Andis makes a good amount of money I think it does about a million dollars a year in total he has a good living I'll actually give you a deal yeah yeah I'll give you a deal because I well the reason being I'll just put you with my cut buddy yeah and you guys can run the business I'll give you 25 000 for uh forty percent all right I'm very I gotta be very honest I don't have time to run around and do this stuff but I do you encounter Tony you encounter I appreciate it so so I came in and I'm offering with what the business is worth today for for you know 25 000 value in the company at that understood would you consider coming in at twenty eight thousand for 25 I Gotta Give it to honestly my partner um You're Gonna Do Well when this thing airs by yourself but I'd really love to have you on board okay well you have an offer and that's it are you willing to go up in the cash Damon do you have any flexibility yeah no that's it that's my final would you would you go up in cash would you do 35 000 for a 30 damage you know what I'm sorry man I don't I don't want to this is really important to you you have a lot of time on your hands to think I I I I think you're going to be okay so I'm going to take the offer off the table I feel bad I feel bad doing that to you and they are not offering you anything I can't believe what was your what was your final offer my final offer I think was 25 000 for 30 percent foreign for thirty percent no man no please please you have a lot of time in your hands you've got a deal [Music] way to go Tony we care about our hair but not that much that's right all right congrats Tony all right thank you guys I thought they were gonna love it but they started dropping out and I had to pull out you know all the stops and thank goodness Damon came through I mean I he's like my favorite shark so I'm so stoked ", "Surfset": "[Music] first into the Shark Tank are Sarah Pond and Mike Hardwick who believe they're on the cusp of the next big Fitness craze hi sharks I'm Mike Harwick and I'm Sarah Pond we're here to present our company surfset Fitness we are seeking 150 000 for 10 equity in our company Surfside Fitness is surf inspired exercise equipment and group fitness classes this is the ripster for X it's the world's first total body surf trainer we've designed it to mimic the instability of a surfboard on water and we have here with us Lakey Peterson she's one of the top 10 female Surfers in the world and she's here to show you a few of her moves so like he's gonna walk through the pop-up this is one of our moves in Surf set it's extremely challenging it's an athletic move she's going to use her arms her Core Balance stability you can see she's rocking side to side all about the imbalance now she's going to show you how a surfer would dive under a wave this is called a duck dive you can see she's engaging her triceps her chest really working the arms the core and we're going to finish with what we call a water Walker so it's similar to a one-legged squat you can see she's trembling a little bit she's engaging every muscle in her core her legs so we're here today sharks because we have more interest in orders than we can handle and we need your help that looks like it's very hard for the average person to do any of those exercises that's quite complex it's very difficult to stay stabilized let's take an average Bozo like Robert absolutely shoes off get the full experience if you can she made it look pretty easy it didn't look that hard I got to be honest so she so she had some experience so we get up one foot at a time all right I'll step by there you go and then bend the knees get into your carve in your surfing motion look at him whoa what was the really hard movies was the one foot yeah go one leg and then you just go like that as if you're like stroking through the water with your like skateboards a little harder yeah you gotta find that middle it's a little uh it gets a little shaky on that one there you go that was good thanks how do you change the the levels changed it really quickly so you want to make this hard to snap these off and it goes just like that that makes it harder you can take all three off and are those on both sides yes what happens if you weigh 300 pounds can you still use it 450. I gotta tell you I'm a little tired see yeah how'd you come up with the idea this guy will talk so I was a professional hockey player and I've been a lifelong Surfer as I was getting towards the end of my career I decided you know I want to surf a little bit more and every time that I spent more time in the ocean I was I felt better on my skates I performed better I had better seasons and I really found right then that there is a tie between Fitness and surfing we made 150 000 in four months running classes so we took it to New York our 11 machines we set up in a very large gym there believe it or not it Just [Music] we had people paying 35 a class sold out classes for the entire four months I'm getting more interested how much is this unit retailing for 400 and your cost 150. you're gonna have to get this down to a hundred dollars for it to retail at 400. uh it's not a problem who's running the show here on the business side that's a good question so um when I went to Europe I got my MBA tried it in finance for a little bit you tried Finance you said yeah it was in finance so do you think there's anything odd about valuing this company at 1.5 million dollars um no we've also had 200 inquiries for franchising to open private studio so you're coming here for not only our money but our strategic assistance but they're only offering US 10 why would you offer us so little it might be little right now but that 10 of a large company it's the company that we have to work for because we don't want you guys to work for us we want to work for for you in a sense we want you to be able to make a phone call and we want to show up how much do you think those phone calls cost a lot it took me 20 years of kissing a lot of butts to get some of those people that's why we value it so highly I'm gonna make you an offer because I think that this is a great idea you could actually go out there and hire professional Surfers to be your certifiers and trainers which would give you a lot of authentication because of that I think you're going to need more than 150 000 in cash to do it right and in order to make an investment in this I have to have enough skin in the game so what I'm going to do is offer you three hundred thousand dollars for 33 percent so what what just happened there is he knocked the value down from a million and a half to nine hundred thousand but I put in you a position to get out there and not have to stress about how much cash you have for inventory and to not stress about hearing these guys Nick one time you got nickel and dime for 33 just now it's an interesting offer Mike I see the business a little bit differently I think you don't need the professional Surfer guys I think they're great but I think that can be intimidating to a lot of people the trainers need to be bubbly energetic I'll give you the 150 000 because I don't think you should give up that much Equity it's going to go big for 20 percent [Music] so a lower valuation is basically what you're saying I'm saying keep more Equity nobody starts a company out of their basement and works their butt off to give up one-third of it at this stage don't gamble your future until you know what you have a lower valuation for Less finally every time I say something here's somebody else talking it always so that's always happening it's like a mini me I have a an offer as well I own many uh CrossFit Gyms so I understand that lifestyle and the culture I'm willing to give 150 but unlimited manufacturing of the boards 25 for free you're gonna give them the boys for free but I just give you the cash right so you have you're a finance guy that's why I'm not messing around yeah but when you go through that cat when you go to that cash you still have to put it back in you have to put it back in I'm giving you cash and now manufacture the boys [Music] Sarah Mike what are you gonna do thank you keep an eye on one thing here as these offers come in because it matters you started with a million and a half ask of the value of what you've created here Mark knocked you down 33 to 900 000. these two very greedy sharks I've knocked you down half of what you asked for so manufacturing is is a plus yes Factory it's just factoring Mike you're gonna have the money anyway it's not just factoring it's not at all you're going to want to do apparel you're going to want to do board shorts you're going to want to do a bunch of things no you're not no you're not vitamin then they're already selling a lifestyle Robert no no but not the beginning the way they're going to fail is by doing too many things at once but they don't need to do too many things at once if they have me on that side you know what I like Damon's better I like the apparel thing I think I want a piece of your deal I want to stop you right I like it better than Marx I just want to give you a word of caution the best sky for you on this deal is Mark Cuban smart lady what that's ridiculous why you're honest it like it is and you're crazy no you just be quiet please Mark's that way he's much richer than you but he's cut out of the same cloth right now what I'm going to offer you is to take half of Mark's position why don't you suck up to everybody up here and it's totally up to Mark the reason you should listen is nobody builds up faster more well-run sales network than I do I oh that is absolute crap oh come on Mike I started a company nine years ago three guys were 160 people today and 100 million in sales we need 52 million last quarter this is what this is you've got a great plan you got to execute I wrote out six CrossFit gyms in the last four months as well as a big training program and if you know anything about CrossFit it's very hard to get certified yes but he's a short man and that doesn't fit your image at all oh wow Barbara so Mark are you in or are you out with Barbara sorry Barbara I don't need you on this one I'm going alone okay in that case I'm out [Music] do you want more money than 150 000 today I think that we could that we could benefit from our money right now if we had more we could do it faster if you have a manufacturing pipeline you don't need more money when a business is on the fast track one of the biggest challenges they have is to keep up with success because they don't have enough cash available to them to meet demand and then somebody else steps in to meet that demand and the quicker you get to the point you need to preempt those competitors the more successful you're going to be let me throw in here for a second because I'm listening to all this and I'm saying to myself you're either going to execute and make this huge because I believe you have the potential and brand is a big part of it for real lasting value it's not just that device it's the brand you're going to create the number one guy to build a brand here is this guy so I want to tack on his deal I'll bring you in on the deal yeah I'd like to do that because they have to yeah and this is where my 24 second shot clock comes in because I need a decision three hundred thousand dollars in cash for a third what partner should you need more because business just explodes there's more money there I don't think you need to give up one third of your business today I think that would be foolish and I don't think you guys are foolish that's way too much so Mike I'm giving you 150 000 for 20 Barbers out Damon and Kevin are 150 000 for 25 and yeah and Manufacturing Mark Cuban is in a 300 000 but he's stealing one third of your company today Sarah Mike what are you gonna do [Music] you come down to me yeah a little bit a little bit on the uh ownership I'll come down to 30 if you say yes right now no don't do it a designer alone is gonna cost you 150. [Music] Bush Sarah you know the right thing to do here [Music] Mark we're gonna accept your offer a horrible deal congratulations [Music] you just made yourself millionaires absolutely [Music] you know Mark you stole their souls these guys are so full of crap you're a thief so excited there were so many offers coming out I'm confident we made the right decision and looking forward to getting started I'm so excited this is exactly what we wanted before you go don't forget to subscribe to the Shark Tank Youtube channel and click on that notification Bell to keep up with everything that's bubbling in the tank ", "Larq": "Volgende is 'n moderne weergawe van 'n\nbelangrike gesondheidsbykomstigheid. Haai Haaie,\nmy naam is Justin Wang. Ek is hier vandag om te vra vir $ 500,\n000 vir 1% van my maatskappy lark. Het jy al ooit opgemerk dat funky\nreuk kom van jou herbruikbare waterbottel?\nEk wed dat jy het. En as jy soos die meeste mense,\nJy doen wat ons die snuiftoets noem. Woo wee. Die gemiddelde herbruikbare water\nbottel bevat meer bakterie\u00eb kolonie as jou hondebak of toiletsitplek.\nGeen wonder hulle stink nie. En dit is nie wonder dit is so aanloklik om na te gryp\n'n eenmalige plastiekwaterbottel. Die gevolg?\nMeer as een miljoen van hierdie ouens is verteer elke minuut,\nen dit is nie goed vir jou gesondheid nie en nog erger vir die omgewing. Daarom het ons die Lark uitgevind\nBottel. Die Lark Bottle is die W\u00eareld se eerste selfreinigende water\nbottel wat water onderweg suiwer. Met 'n eenvoudige druk van 'n knoppie en\nnet 60 sekondes, die Lark Bottle aktiveer ons\ngepatenteerde UV C LED-tegnologie, Suiwer afgrond om 99,99% van\nskadelike en reuk wat bakterie\u00eb veroorsaak, virusse en vorm. Die resultate?\nSuiwer water uit 'n ongerepte skoongemaakte Bottel. So haaie. Vir baie. Wil net wees\nDuidelik. Ek het jou behoorlik gehoor. 500, 000 vir 1%. Dis korrek. Robert\nGeluk. Die hoogste waardasie ooit aangevra in die\nHaai tenk. Jy lyk soos 'n redelike mens. Vertel ons hoekom\ndit is terloops, in al 50 minute. Ek het 'n paartjie\nhiervan. O jy doen goed. Jy doen. Dit is\nWonderlik. Ek doen. Maar wat is die mark geleentheid wat dit regverdig?\nDit is dus 'n groot mark. Groot water is 'n regte ding. Dit is 'n $ 300 miljard\nmark w\u00eareldwyd. Van watter herbruikbare mark is slegs 7%?\nDit groei. Ek het probeer sweer van eenmalige plastiekwaterbottel\n'n paar jaar gelede. Ek het verskeie gekoop redelike opsies en seker genoeg\nhulle beland agter in die kas waar my gym sak hulle sou\nversamel vorm. As dit in my kar gesit het, was dit sou stink. So dis die self\nskoonmaak deel. Dit lyk vir my of jy 'n UV het\nlig in die bokant. Kan jy verduidelik Hoe dit werk en wat dit doen?\nDit is eintlik 'n optiese stelsel dit is ontwerp om die UV te weerspie\u00ebl\nlig binne. So eenvoudig, jy druk hierdie knoppie,\ndie UV-lig skakel aan. My medestigter is 'n PhD in fisika van Caltech.\nHy het dit ontwerp om na te bons optiese lig regdeur die bottel.\nSo dan hoeveel minute doen dit neem om dit te doen?\nOns het twee modusse. Ons normale modus is 60 sekondes,\nen dan het ons 'n waagmodus, wat 3 minute is. So as jy wil\nom dit na 'n ontwikkelende land te neem of kamp of jy is net iewers\nwaar jy nie heeltemal die water, Justin,\nIs dit veiliger as kookwater? Dit sou die ekwivalent van\nkookwater vir so 20 minute. Regtig. Kompetisie. Is jy die\nnet een wat UV het? Aktivering en skoonmaak,\nons het in Oktober 2018 bekendgestel. Ons was die eerste een op die mark. Ons\nhet ongeveer 10 patente, beide nut en ontwerp hier rondom\nproduk en ander produkte. Maar daar is kopies daar buite wat\nons streef na potensi\u00eble reg aksies vir nou. So Justin,\nWaarom is dit $ 50 miljoen werd? Daarom het ons hierdie produk in 2018 bekendgestel.\nSo ons was op die mark vir 'n klein, amper twee jaar,\nonder twee jaar. En in ons eerste volle jaar in 2019,\nons het 'n bietjie meer as vyf en 'n half gedoen, $ 1,000,000 in verkope. In die laaste 12 maande,\nOns het meer as $ 9 miljoen gedoen. Hierdie jaar beplan ons om $ 14 te doen\nMiljoen. Wat jy gaan maak op die 14,000,000?\nSo het ons ons eerste buitekant gebring waagkapitaal rond vroe\u00ebr hierdie\njaar in Januarie, en ons het geleun om die\nBesigheid. So hierdie jaar is ons verwag om ongeveer $ 1,000 te verloor,\n000. Justin, hoeveel het jy ingesamel? 6.7 By watter waardasie?\nTeen 'n waardasie van $31,7 miljoen. So Kom ons praat net regte besigheid.\nJy het net 6.7 ingesamel. Hoeveel kos jy het in die bank?\nEk het ongeveer 6,5. OUKEI so jy hoef regtig nie te spandeer nie\nenigiets goed vir jou, reg? Ja. Waarvoor verkoop dit?\nDie wyn wat jy net daar het, is 95. Ek het 95 hiervoor betaal. Al is dit,\nLiewe aarde dit gaan jou eintlik nie kos nie.\nWat om dit te maak? Die grondkoste is ongeveer 40. Jy\nhet ges\u00ea jy het baie patente. Wat is daardie ander produkte wat jy reeds\nh\u00ea? Sommige van die patente dek net\n'n paar ander toepassings, maar sommige van hulle is wel van toepassing op die nuwe\nProduk. Dit is die groot prentjie, wat ons eerste inval in die\nHuis. Laat ek dit baie vinnig doen. En terwyl dit gaan,\nEk sal jou 'n video wys van hoe dit Werk. Tradisionele waterfoto's\ngebruik 'n filter en die grootste probleem is dat hulle slegs kontaminante vang\nwaar hulle vinnig kon ophoop en vermenigvuldig en eintlik omkeer\nbesoedel jou water. Waarom keer hulle besoedeling om?\nOmdat die kontaminante word daar vasgekeer en versamel. En as\nkieme groei, daar is 'n nat poreuse omgewing\ndis donker. Stel jou dus voor al die dinge wat daar kan groei.\nOns volg dus 'n tweestap-benadering. Die eerste stap,\njy sien dit gaan deur en dit vang dinge soos lood, kadmium,\nKwik. In die tweede stap, jy druk eenvoudig op hierdie knoppie en dit\nsal die water wat weg is, suiwer Deur. En soos u kan sien,\ndit is 'n Clearwater wat ons gooi blou water in wat besmet is\nSkoonwater. Maar is iemand anders doen jy dit?\nNiemand doen dit nie. Daar is 'n miljoen mense op planeet het nie\ntoegang tot skoon water. En 1,5 miljoen het nie toegang tot\nelektrisiteit so. Ek dink nie een van daardie mense nie\nkry nou hierdie bottel omdat hulle nie 95 dollar het nie.\n1% van al ons opbrengs gaan na ons liefdadigheidsvennoot,\n1% vir die planeet liefdadigheid water goed bewus waar ons putte in Afrika bou.\n1% van die winste, 1% van die inkomste wat ons van bruto belowe\ninkomste, bruto inkomste 1%. Dit is dit is indrukwekkend van die boonste lyn af. Ek\nbeteken jy is toegewyd. Ek kry dit. Dit is belangrik. Damon gaan\nom 'n spies deur jou te steek. Nee Ek kan nog,\nmaar ek wil dit net uitl\u00ea waar Ek is\nOUKEI. Ek dink ons is in 'n tyd wanneer Mense is regtig kwaad. Hulle is\nop soek na hoop. En toe ek hierby aanmeld\nPlatform die platform het nie begin as die\nrykes help die rykes met 6.5 miljoen in die bank. Ek kon net\ndoen dit nie omdat ek net dink dat ek om 'n ander rede hier is.\nEk dink dit is mal. Ek sal die ander haaie bespreek dit,\nmaar ek is uit. Ek kom ook van 'n agtergrond waar ek nie baie gehad het nie.\nDit is jammer dat u dit nie sal neem nie reis saam met my,\nmaar ek respekteer wat jy s\u00ea, Laat ek dus 'n kans daarop neem. Ek\nondersteun 'n liefdadigheidsorganisasie genaamd One Drop, om seker te maak dat almal kan drink\nvars water regoor die w\u00eareld. Iets wat ek agter kan kom. Hou daarvan om hierby betrokke te wees,\nmaar ek doen dit nie vir 1% nie. Ek breek te veel waarde. Ek het nog nooit 'n\nhandel vir 1% om voor die hand liggende redes. Ek sal dit vir 4% doen. Ek gee nie om hoe nie\njy struktureer dit, adviesaandele, Wat. So jy wil h\u00ea hy moet dit doen\nbyna 'n derde van sy laaste Ronde?\nEk het nie ges\u00ea jy sal daarvan hou nie, Markus, of jy sou. Ek s\u00ea net vir jou\nwat ek sou doen. Is daar ander bied daar buite of jy weet,\nom u 'n halwe $ 1,000,000 vir 1% te gee? Ek voel asof ek niks maak nie. Die kategorie waarin ons is, is\nreusagtig, die $ 300 miljard-industrie, en dit is so ryp vir ontwrigting en\nso ryp vir innovasie. Ek dink ek is gaan aanbiedinge neem en luister na\nLori. Ek sal graag saam met jou wil werk. Ek sal daarvan hou 500,000 vir 5%. Jy hou aan om agteruit te gaan,\nJustin. Justin, die probleem met 1% is dat u geprys word\nvir perfeksie. En ja, Ek sal graag 1% van Apple wil besit en\nEk sal graag 1% van Tesla wil besit, Maar die kans is net so laag. Om\nmaak dit makliker vir jou beleggers, Ek sal 500 doen,\n000 vir 3%.

", "Tog Samphel": "next up is an innovation to a common kitchen accessory [Music] what's up sharks my name is tog and I'm from Clifton New Jersey I'm seeking 150 000 for 20 equity in my company sharks I love to cook and tongs are one of the best tools that I have in the kitchen but you know what sucks it seems I never have enough when I'm cooking or serving food you might say just buy more tongs come on nobody wants to do that look at these things they're large they're clunky they take up space and every time you need them the bird in a sink full of dirty dishes and that's why I invented any tops it's a simple compact tool that transforms ordinary utensils into versatile kitchen tops check out how they work you just grab any combination of Forks or spoons insert the handles do the rubberized slot give it a firm tug and instant tops is when you're working with multiple dishes you don't have to worry about cross-contaminating food you just attach and reload with clean ones that's pretty cool and when you're done just pop them out and toss them in the wash you got two spoons boom now you got tongs how about Forks boom any tongs any time so who's ready to assemble some tongs and grab a piece of this company so if we can make it here yes you can just take the handles slide them through the rubberized slots give it a little tug if it's a little bit loose am I not doing it right you put it down then you pull it up oh got it this is crazy so how did you come up with this so This I love product design I've been a designer a user experience designer for over 10 years you know I worked for Nintendo AOL I worked at Facebook and I always wanted to design a physical product my family's from Tibet and we always had to have these parties and I remember my mom she always needed a lot of tongs for the different kind of dishes she used to make tongs out of plastic utensils and tape them to clothesline pins so that's the idea that I came up with as my first product it's really brilliant idea did you patent this no um for this V1 it wasn't worth it so what I did was I ran a Kickstarter campaign the original goal was ten thousand dollars we ended up doing over thirty three thousand dollars right which ship everybody their Toms yep so so what did you sell them for and what did it cost you to make landed those are being sold for 19.99 for one and our most popular was a two pack for 24.99 what did it cost you to make two dollars look tongs are as little as nine dollars and ninety nine cents some are even cheaper than that it's like a standard utensil I mean there are thousands of tongs for sale definitely and I've done the research 1999 was a pretty fair price it resonated with people on the kickstarter we got a lot of great feedback so there's no validation past Kickstarter right when I started selling this on my own I got really good with social media ads my return on ad spend was around a dollar which wasn't much but soon after I got that to three dollars but I ran out of money I ran out of inventory that doesn't make sense with your margins you shouldn't run out of money because you're getting paid up front because you're selling them online and you should be able to recycle your buys yeah so this this isn't there wasn't much inventory we so for 20 for 2021 our sales were about seven thousand dollars since the kickstarter campaign ended till now you've only sold seven thousand yes because of covid our manufacturer had massive problems so at that point I said okay you know what screw it we're going to work on version two so in 2021 I spent time designing and working too what's different it has like a thicker Griffin a lot one it's using much better materials it's more eco-friendly it has a much more secure way of attaching utensils how much does that cost to make a little over a dollar to manufacture that's it yeah so why is that one cheaper than this one because the production run for this would be much higher so you're going to just make more paying for a very very low volume price yes okay so I'm very involved in the kitchen space the food space you earn on an interesting journey and you have a lot of enthusiasm but I don't see much potential here at your price points you got to make this thing so inexpensive certainly in 1999 is not going to work I'm sorry my friend I'm out so something in your passion for the design isn't translating in the market I'm not saying you can't get there but the early signs aren't great for me so I I don't see it you know what time I think it's a genius product but you're only 10 of the way there having a great product is not near enough to have a great company as an investor as a shark we'd have to come in and structure a lot of that for you because you're not there full time so for that reason I'm honest hold on Mark before you say anything I already said it but go ahead yeah look I'm doing this all by myself this this grind culture right this whole thing where you got to give up everything to start something to do something that you that you always dreamed about it's okay what do they always tell you okay you're gonna put your family in a financial crisis you gotta give up seeing all your friends and family you've got to sacrifice your your health and lose sleep you know nobody says that I told you that nobody says it's out there and that's true that's the message I'm not saying this is easy work but what I refuse to do is put my family in financial crisis what I refuse to do is Miss the most important it is your company my friend you get to make all the choices but it's our money and I'm gonna tell you again I'm out all right Damon what are you doing I wasn't more interested in talks uh uh letting us know how to become successful the business is not commanding enough for you to be able to put full attention there I agree with you you need to do the basics to keep the bills paying the lights on for your family because if you don't have your family you don't have anything with that being said you still got seven thousand dollars in sales when because because of the fact that there was a lot of issues I knew I know what oh man you got 7 000 cells because you sold seven thousand you you can't always internalize no I'm definitely not this is your company it is your responsibility it is your job 100 I'm not I'm not making that a little early however this is a flyer I'll give you 150 000 for 49 percent honestly talk I think he gave you a really good offer mine would be worse and so therefore I'm out I think you should take Damon's off Damon can you do 40 percent [Music] and you know what just for everyone out here okay screw it I'm gonna say it okay what is it gonna take I'll quit I'll focus on this 100 I'm ready to go all in all don't you just had you just having the whole speech about yourself a Financial Risk well you know what who the hell knew that I was gonna get here in this spot right now but you're selling yourself out of a deal I don't want to speak for Damon but he made you an offer you countered and rather than waiting to hear what he had to say to that counter you went off in this wild tangent about screw it you're trying to show your dedication okay exactly what do you want to do Damon I'm gonna stay at the 49 and the reason I'm saying in 49s but I want you to be in control I want you to keep your company damn it I I love I love your offer and the fact that I got one is incredible Let's Make a Deal all right [Music] all right [Music] I said I was going to quit my job because of the fact that I got to this point and if I didn't go all in in front of the Sharks I would regret it forever so you know I'm happy to be a flyer I'll be his number one flyer dive into the Shark Tank Youtube channel And subscribe now ", "Outer": "next into the tank is a new idea in the outdoor furniture space [Music] hi sharks my name is jake liu and i'm carrie lynn we're the co-founders of outer we're seeking 750 thousand dollars in exchange for four percent equity stake in our company [Music] imagine for a moment it's early in the morning the house is still quiet your coffee just finished brewing it's a perfect spring day the birds are chirping you look outside at your outdoor sofa coffee in hand you inhale deeply [Music] oh the cushions are wet and now so are my pants we call that the soggy bottom syndrome sharks that's just one of many problems with outdoor furniture it falls apart easily it's very uncomfortable or they're stored in the garage somewhere never to be used at outer we've solved all of those problems we've created the perfect outdoor sofa that's as comfortable as your bed and as durable as your camping equipment all while using eco-friendly materials most importantly no more soggy bottoms without patent-pending invention the outer shell cover let me show you how it works in the evening all you have to do is cover up and then pull the outer shell over and the cushion is completely protected from the elements if you know there's a rainstorm coming all you have to do is take it and go with you so it's very easy to carry and store cool for the next morning there's going to be a layer of morning dew on here but all you have to do is open it up flip it open the perfect sofa ready for you to enjoy so we've created the perfect outdoor sofa but we realized that the shopping experience wasn't great typically when you see an outdoor sofa you see it inside in a climate controlled environment where it never has seen sun rain or bird poop so we've actually revolutionized the shopping experience we've developed a proprietary peer-to-peer showroom platform it's where we convert our customers showrooms into our showrooms and in doing so customers can see touch and feel the sofa before they decide to buy it's something that we call the neighborhood showroom it's the sharing economy for retail so sharks who is ready to join us to bring life outside how much does the sofa cost so the sofa you're looking at right now the three-seater is 2500 okay i don't think that's what does it cost you land so so each share is 800 so they're modular by the way i don't know retail cost is eight eight twenty dollars you can average it out and then the cost of goods made is about two twenty five or so two twenty five yeah so i wanna make sure i understand this is instead of having a showroom where you have your own retail space so to speak your customers are opening up their backyards exactly you guys do i understand that right you got that perfectly so what do i get paid for allowing that to happen yeah so we're testing uh that right now and uh you you're expected to make about 20 to 50 dollars per visit and the platform that we built when you you have to book a visit you can't just show up to somebody's home randomly right thank you so much 750 000. four percent puts 18 eight 18.7 million yes why is this worth 18 plus million dollars so kevin they're they're so the outdoor furniture market in the u.s nine billion dollars oh that's the worst answer it's a very bad thing to say kevin how big is the bankruptcy market in the u.s it's really really big well go ahead jake uh we we just launched about four months ago and we did about eight hundred thousand dollars in sales to date you haven't made any money yet have you uh we're not making money yet why 18 million what's the reason yeah um so we first of all we just closed our last round uh with our vc backed at what valuation that was 13.5 million valuation so you came into the shark tank and raised it even more how much do you project this year this year we're going to close out at least a million dollars next year we're projecting five so how many partners do you have and what percentage of the company do you two own i own sixty percent carry on 25 and my family factory owns 15 so another another answer to the valuation is because we've actually taken out the risk on the supply chain so they essentially giving us that cost right your family's subsidizing you by not taking a margin because they own 15 percent of the business that's right have to pay for the inventory until we sell it that's interesting so guys uh you know the valuation is crazy you know you're gonna you only sold 800 000 hopefully 1.5 and you're you're evaluating it over 18 million dollars you know exactly what's going to happen to you here right so i'm out so so for me coming from silicon valley i'm used to seeing mass evaluations all the time and and i i frankly i way overpaid for a number of deals that i think can potentially change the world or actually have a huge impact i don't think it's it's world-changing for me so for that reason i'm out hey guys i think it's a great business could it be 100 million dollar business yeah it really could be but look at it from my end right let's just say you do 200 million dollars sure and your margins are 10 net margins you'd be thrilled to death you're making 20 million dollars i'm making 5 of that that's i mean that's not bad money but the risk reward for versus what you're asking just is not there well the current d2c brands have a multiple of anywhere from three yeah but that's great you and you found the vcs that pay those kind of multiples right that ain't me that's not shark tank for those reasons i'm out i like it i i really do but i don't need any disrespect to the previous vcs they are not mr wonderful i am you may not like this offer but i'm going to make it anyways three sharks are out but kevin seems interested in terry and jake's outdoor furniture company outer you may not like this offer but i'm going to make it anyways now traditionally to get back my capital i would want some kind of cash flow in the form of you know maybe i'd make it dead or maybe i'll make a royalty but i'm in a generous mood today i'm feeling first so i'm going to give you 750 000 straight equity i want 20 percent i don't care if he laughs he didn't give you any money um i want to hear lori i love it i want to be part of it but you've just started selling it how about this let me throw a different type of offer at you so give you a 750 000 loan as a line of credit but i want 20 in royalty per chair the royalty until i get paid back the 750 into a million and then at the end of the day i'll have 10 of the company you know grasshopper you've learned from the master that sounded like your kind of deal i know there's only one mr wonderful and he is amazing i could easily do that deal and even bait it because that's my kind of deal she basically laurie learned that from the master would you match that deal or how would you beat that deal if you want him to match my deal and you would pick him then i'm going to go out and do that i'll do it no i'll do the deal seriously you're going to lose me and that you will regret forever i'll do it forever let's equity that's ridiculous yeah baby just to shake it up make a decision make a decision guys so i'll go for it yeah okay all right so our counter to uh lori's offer is um 750 000 uh in loan uh enrolled he will pay back to the 750 and on the equity side we would love to bring it down to four percent what we ask for when we come in you want me to get up every morning and be like i can't wait to blow that up i mean you need that passion you need that and i'm worth it i'm worth it kevin's willing to do five percent 750. i think that's really attractive but we do want to work with you i i feel that connection so is there any way you can match that we'll even throw in the million dollars so it's a million dollar pay back to the royalty but five people you want to raise the royalty uh the royalty like you want to kick up the royalty and i'll go down in the percentage you can afford it especially with how many will sell uh what's your offer on the royalty well why don't we go to 30. 30 works i think 30 works 30 up until 1 million so 750 000 is a loan okay i get 30 a chair until a million okay it's paid off we'll make it three percent interest and five percent equity let's do it lori do it it's good this is so brilliant in the outdoor space wait till they see the other things honestly it's brilliant we're working more products congratulations guys thank you guys thank you guys you ", "Rumpl Blankets": "[Music] next up is a product designed to bring a little bit of comfort when you're in the great outdoors [Music] hi my name is wylie and i'm here to tell you about my company rumple but first sharks i gotta ask you a question how do you sleep at night i'm guessing it's under a cozy warm blanket right blankets are the best and they've been keeping people warm and comfortable for centuries but it's been decades since anybody's thought to give them an upgrade meanwhile we've seen a textile revolution happening in outdoor gear and athletic apparel sharks rumple has taken these proven new age materials and created a line of durable weatherproof lightweight blankets they're extremely versatile warm and cozy and can travel with you from the home to the outdoors and back they repel pet hair debris and stains come on don't waste wine it's cheap stuff don't worry that's the best stuff rumple blankets will keep you protected but the thing i'm most proud of sharks is protecting the planet each of these blankets is made using 60 recycled plastic bottles that might otherwise end up in landfills awesome additionally we offset 100 of our carbon footprint every year and donate one percent of all sales to environmental causes because we care about protecting the places that inspired the idea for rumple in the first place i'm seeking six hundred thousand dollars for a four percent stake of this booming practices you are oh there are samples for you on your tables in front of you please let's get cozy and get to it and where do you sell where do you sell and how uh we're selling online amazon uh we're in every rei i actually bought one in aria oh yeah you know the product what do you think do you like it i think the product's great i don't really like the valuation right now but we'll talk about that more i gotta tell you this is on me right now it is really warm yeah to be so thin it's amazing you look like a grandmother i'm i'm happy though looking like a grandmother what is in the inside what is the so the ones you guys have right there uh they have a hollow fiber synthetic fill it's basically like a bucatini pasta tube i mean instead of just looking out yes exactly instead just leaning like the technical aspects of the blanket i mean it's great i have one i'm a customer but this reminds me a lot when i started toms like we had a shoe that a lot of people could copy so there's nothing in this blanket that doesn't mean that i can't start a company just like it tomorrow sure but what's most important to me wiley is like why did you get passionate about blankets sure i was on a ski trip with a friend just outside mammoth and our our car froze it was like the coldest night on record in mammoth and we woke up the next morning car wouldn't start and uh we were several miles up a dirt road we we had no cell service so it was kind of a sketchy situation we found ourselves in and uh we bundled up in our sleeping bags and we started talking about how man you know i really like these materials so much more than my comforter back home and we decided you know when we get out of here we're going to make a sleeping bag blanket we bundled up in our sleeping bags and just waited for somebody to show up it was several hours before somebody eventually did so what does one cost 100 bucks and what's your landed cost 25 25 bucks so that's it are you selling it wholesale what 50 50 40 49 15. can you just take us through like the year you started and what the sales ramp up have been yeah so we started end of 2013 2014 we did 450k in sales then 950 2.7 5.3 oh 8.8 wow 6.5 oh and i'll explain that and then this year on track for eight what happened to that big drop you lost a wholesale account no well yes um actually what happened is in 2018 when we did 8.8 3 million of that was really just with two large corporate accounts how many competitors are doing pretty much the exact thing right now in the wholesale channel and direct channel there's probably a good 15 companies doing something similar to 15. this is a big problem i think because i mean no disrespect to the business right now but to have this level of valuation and have zero barriers to entry and 15 competitors that makes me really scared what are you gonna and before you leave because your valuation is 15 million dollars you do have to bring up how much money you're going to make off the eight million oh yeah we're going to peek on this what's the profitability it's going to be about five six percent this year so four to four only five and six will rent pre-tax free tax that's the profit uh yeah pre-tax so how much money have you raised yeah i really want to talk to you guys about this because i know this is gonna be a sticking point here has raised a good amount of money we've done two seed rounds both of those uh equaled about a million dollars and then in 2018 we did a proper a round and we'd raised 3.8 million dollars so that leads to the next question how much cash do you have in the bank three and a half million whoa why are you here i am here because i would like to take this product and this brand into sports license worst excuse ever to be here you could you could something million in the bank you got enough to hire people to go out and do licensing and to acquire the licenses where you know i'm trying to focus do you think he's here for the exposure or do you think he really wants us to invest yep wiley look i'm not buying the whole i can't get sports licensing help without you guys so for those reasons i'm out uh you know wiley um it takes my breath away that you would come in here and ask me to pay you 50 times free cash flow for blankets we don't really need the cash what we need is a partner and what i'm willing to talk about is alone with a royalty did you say royalty i said royalty was i being nasty to you i take it all back no it's all fair okay you know why wiley cause you have something called sales hit me what do you got all right so i would like to potentially structure this as a 600 000 loan 10 interest paid back over two years and then five percent of all uh revenue generated in the sports license channel i'm gonna make you an offer a loan is six hundred thousand dollars or ten percent um and five percent of sales for two years that's crazy hold on so when my sun stashes guys came on here they had nothing i got them all at disney all a marvel pokemon sports license all of that stuff damon i think we should do this together if you can help grow those channels i know i can help in the d2c blake and i will give you six hundred thousand dollars at a ten percent that's a loan i would go after licenses for you blake you're gonna go after wholesale yeah i mean i can literally grow his wholesale by 500 tomorrow so two and a half percent to each of us for two years on all sales and then that's done and we get four percent i'll give you the uh six hundred thousand dollars uh i'll take four percent but we're not going to call it a loan i'm just going to say give me 10 bucks a blank until i get back 1.8 million dollars and i keep the 4 because i became your partner in my shark tank portfolio and i'd rather just take the 600 and pour it on to direct sales that's it you don't have to go nuts i'm going to tell you what i have your free cash flow what do you got lori i'm out good call lori yeah so so damon i think we need more equity uh after doing this math and we're gonna do a ton of work on this business so the deal is six hundred thousand dollar loan at ten percent two and a half percent to me and to damon for two years and 10 equity the deals keep on getting worse for you i mean that's no i that's it i like the mr wonderful offer better i i like the mr wonderful offer better than that one as well i was really excited when i learned that you were going to be the guest shark i've admired you as an entrepreneur and an individual for a long time thank you um what if we do 600 000 uh as a loan 10 interest paid back over two years 2.5 royalty on sales for two years okay and four percent equity so it's the same offer that came in you're gonna have to give up 10 to get two sharks and really you've already said you want to be dating blake you're not going to the dance with damon yeah i mean you can throw damon under the bus which you're about to do because there's no way you're giving up 10 that's right i'm not giving up 10 what do you want to do that's the decision all right so i'm going to give you clarity for this one i don't want to get in the way so i'm out i appreciate that damon no disrespect honestly no distance like look the thing is is i was excited to do a deal with damon on the licensing but i also just have to look at the value of my time yep and i'm only going to focus on two maybe three investments a year i'm going to get involved like a founder and so i need to be treated like a founder and unless i have 10 equity i just won't feel like a founder and i won't be motivated to help you as much as i want to and that 10 is just as low as i can go what are you gonna do wiley [Music] guys i'm sorry i can't do these deals oh i apologize you ", "Soapsox": "[Music] my name is Ray and I'm Alvin and we are from the Eagle Rock neighborhood in Los Angeles California ring I grew up in the same neighborhood never really hung out until I married my wife who happened to have gone to the same high school with Ray now we're close friends and business partners too oh that looks like fun I came up with the idea for this business we're working at a treatment facility for children and one of the more difficult times was bath time there was one kid in particular who had refused to bathe for a few days he let me know what the problem was and that's when I had my aha moment I spent years developing and improving the product but still something was missing then I realized Alvin had his own design company so I asked him to help me design the product further that looks really really good we have a lot of interest from major retailers but we can't scale fast enough to get our product out there we need the Sharks expertise and capital to take our product Nationwide this is it for us Grace given up his job I've transitioned my business and totally focused on this product so we're all in here [Music] thank you hi sharks my name is Ray Phillips and I'm Alvin oui we're the founders of soap socks from Eagle Rock California we're here today seeking 260 thousand dollars for 10 Equity stake in our company sharks meat soap socks the next generation of washcloths for kids sharks as parents maybe you struggle with this you come home after a long day of work you start the evening routine of homework dinner time then bath time ah bath time how do I get my kid to bathe without the screaming and crying with sharks we have the solution what we came up with is an adorable new line of plush toys that kids can take from playtime to bath time oh Lord what we've done is take a cute and cuddly plush toy turn into a bad fade by simply replacing its inner stuffing with antimicrobial sponge replacing the outer material with terry cloth let me show you how it works simply take soap and put it in take the shark's mouth or under the shell of Taylor the turtle simply Add Water use the uniquely designed finger pockets for better handling work into a lather and let bad time begin and after bath time simply hang your soap sock to dry or just toss them through the laundry so sharks why are you letting us throw some soap socks into your tank and you throw some cash into hours so we're gonna head out to Apple to you now we have seven different characters that we launched with um it's Miss hersheyvick we started with you with the wonderful hippo uh because I get the pink hip you get the Pink Hippo because you know hippos are nice and cuddly and they look the part but they're the most dangerous animals out there in the world thank you yeah yeah that's a turtle okay this is our best selling turtle and we wanted to make sure you had that Mr Wonderful you're kind of known to spit some fire so we figured we'd compliment you with our wonderful drive it's the dragon of Truth Damon you're more of a like sit and wait kind of guy for the perfect opportunity to get your deals so we figured it'd be appropriate to get you guys uh Mark that's the big shark that's tank the shark he's the biggest shark of them all so I wanted to make sure you should have gotten a donkey for Mark what's your history in business to come up with this idea so I worked at a residential treatment facility for abuse kids for a number of years and one of the more difficult times was bath time we had one kid in particular who had refused to bathe and he was carrying a little stuffed animal and he was like that mean lady won't let me take my stuffed animal into the bathtub with me and so I said we could we can fix that hold on and I thought outside the box I had the staff grab another stuffed animal made it hold soap lathered it up and he was like okay I'll go and so after that then they're like hey maybe you should go for it and so then I partnered with Alvin who has a background in design and product design and he made the magic happen give us a sales profile of which retailers you're in this is a retail oriented product we've been on the market for six months we've done 300 000 in sales some of the major retailers is Nordstrom's they're going to be rolling us out across the country I'm guessing that you have a patent pending on them so we have our design patent pending and our utility patent pending and what do they retail for we are retailing them for 19.95 what do they cost you to make they cost 3.60 currently Ray tell me about the forecast for this year and next year we're on track to do 576 000 remainder this year next year we are estimated to do 2.4 million let me ask you something yes 20 bucks for a spun yeah is a lot of money because every other plush toy in the store that looks like this is 499 599 this is a really premium plush toy like the first in my life I've ever received for twenty dollars I think you guys got a nice business you're killing it on margins but it's not a business that gets me lathered up um I don't know that I can help so for those reasons oh gosh the whole thought of Mark lathered up just sort of you know people would pay for that I have a question instead of going out there with Nordstrom and putting it out at 1999. can you go back to manufacturers and see if there's any way you can get the price down and then not take such a hefty margin you have a really Hefty margin great Lori does have a valid point what is the lowest you can make it at two we can get it down we think we can get down to 252.70. for you to get it down to 250 what is the quantity you have to buy in 600 000 units or more wow guys the price is too high I can't even see this ever long term more than 12.99 ever it should be 9.99 and you're not worth 2.6 million I'm out [Music] what you're proving is you have a great concept but at a 2.6 million dollar value for me today to give you 260 000. I don't think you've quite proven that my money wants to go there I'm afraid I'll take a bath thank you I'm out so guys why are you valuing at a 2.6 uh we are on schedule to hit the five just under 600 000 by the end of the year and on schedule because you have existing orders that will take you there yes okay so I want to be part of this but I can't give you a valuation of 2.6 I'll give you 260 000 for 33 percent that's my offer if you don't mind I'd like to hear I'm around with this so let's move it along when something's going to happen I think it's really a smart product great job really clear what it is the name is fantastic soap socks then I have the other side of me that's saying you have a patent pending but I don't know if you're going to get it and in the time that it'll take for you to get it it might be two years three years and someone else make happier if you're at a lower price you could Blitz the market I'm out thank you thank you so could you reset your offer damages so that we're clear yeah my offer is 200 260 000 for 33 percent to make us equal Partners The Three Musketeers we don't mind doing the hard work that percentage higher than what we'd want to give away I would like to they'll make a mistake just in case just think about this all right if you're wrong on the pricing in other words if the market that really clears is 9.99 which I think it is you're really going to need this guy because you're going to go out with a misstep launch the first retailers that you put the skus into are going to have slow sales if you list you and then you're going to have to re retrace and figure out how to get the manufacturing cost down to about a buck 35. on your own that's gonna be hard and so if he's willing to do it I mean if you walk out here without that deal you're making a big mistake four sharks are out Alvin and Ray are seeking 260 000 for 10 percent of their children's bath Toy Company soap socks Damon has offered the amount they are seeking but he wants 33 percent of the company if you walk out here without that deal you're making a big mistake suck it up take the pain you asked for too much in the first place all right yes for too much you want a 260 and those are the rules of Shark Tank it's got to give you 260. you got to pay for that mistake you're paying for right now [Music] um the 33 is steep uh for us and and what we've been doing we know you bring a lot of value uh you were one of those sharks that we were hoping to be able to get a deal with and I'm hoping we can still come to an agreement of where that number really lies um would you be willing to do 15 percent for 350. oh they are proud wow proud I should wash his mouth out with soap for that counter yeah so guys I'm gonna have to stay firm on the 33. I have a question yes we offered you a million dollars to just buy it out [Music] we aren't afraid of the hard work and building it to something bigger for us it's not about the money I've been designing products for bigger companies I I know I'm good but this is the first time where I feel like you know what I'm finally doing something for myself we own this we're Dream Chasers right now so we don't want to give it away we want a partnership but We're Dreaming we're chasing after an American Dream Lori and I saw a lot of value in the product but I think her and I see a potentially different path so we just thought we're willing to risk a million dollars to try to take it down that path you're innovators so this I don't think is going to be your last product yeah it's going to be the first of many guys you got you got to make a decision you got a million dollar offer or you can partner with Damon you got to give up a third of the company what are you going to do we're gonna have to climb both offers thank you thank you guys bye good luck thank you good luck a little disappointed that they evaluated our product that much I don't think even if they'd offered us five million dollars that we would have taken it or 10 million dollars because it's so much more than that ", "Project Pollo": "[Applause] up next a new approach to a fast food favorite [Music] hi my name is Lucas Bradbury founder and CEO of project Poyo America's first vegan chicken fast food chain sharks I'm here to protest we demand change and when it comes to Quick Serve restaurants there's only two options available one something that's affordable made from very questionable meat-based product or two something that costs a wing and a leg that's on the healthier side and As Americans we all deserve affordable access to plant-based foods and that's why we created project Poyo real delicious food made from real plants now our original project is a hand breaded crispy chicken patty that's made from 100 soy and it's truly to die for but no animals had to die for it to be this good now we didn't just stop there we also have Burgers wraps salads shakes and oh yeah my personal favorite Buffalo mac and cheese and take a look at that and sharks our mission was simple we wanted everyone regardless of their income to be able to afford these options after all the future of mass consumption is plant-based now sharks it's time that we demand better it's time that we free the chickens it's time that we start putting people over the profits and start doing Poyo with the purpose and that's why I'm here today embrace yourself sharks seeking 2.5 million dollars in exchange for five percent of my company [Applause] I like the opportunity for all to try the product I've made for you guys today so in front of you the half sandwich is going to be our Deluxe chicken sandwich you have our chicken nuggets on there served alongside of our fries and then of course the Buffalo mac and cheese sitting there happy to answer questions for you guys but please enjoy really good I appreciate that thank you coming from a true Chef that's amazing yeah Chef wonderful election I tried a lot of fake chicken this is the best I've had no appreciate that it's proprietary for us and that's one of the reasons we really really are taking this initiative to scale out as quickly as we are really thank you Get Fooled by the name I would assume pulling up to your place that project Polo meant it was chicken yeah and so we did that strategically because we wanted to engage with the guests and we explain at the counter this is 100 plant-based we have people that are reluctant that want to step back and say oh no it's not for me that's our interaction with them to say let us give you a sample let us buy your first meal it's on us if you don't like it no problem okay Lucas look the food's great okay I got it 50 million valuations Lucas Honey Sweetie poopsie let's get right to it you must have a ton of sales yeah so I really really thought that there was a void in the market for someone to really take some initiative and go on a national level uh positioning themselves to put plant-based Foods out there are a number coming soon there is let me let me tell you this little back story here and um you know you don't get swollen the later it comes so typical story max out credit cards take every bit of savings out of the family's account my wife never knew about it dump it all bought a food truck response was great that was September 18th last year and then open another location December January locations these are all physical brick and mortar locations now corporate owners we have our 11th and 12th locations opening next week right now if we stopped current progress with these opening stores we'd be doing just roughly shy of 10 million let's talk about what you've done year to date here to date we're shy of 3 million um that's that's going through the end of August we're shy forward-looking we should be hitting six maybe three million is how many stores that's off of eight stores we've opened up all these stores in one year I've never heard of such a thing how did you do that so fast yeah so I don't want to drag this on for the next five years wondering if my concept has validity if that's scalability so originally made the decision like we're going as fast as we possibly can so you don't have proof of concept so you needed a lot of money you needed a lot of Manpower and you it's taking an enormous risk all at once 100 where did you get all the other money obviously yeah let me walk you through the money so bootstrapped out of my pocket to start off with so how much money did you put into it that was the food that was the food truck our first location in Austin all in I put about roughly ballpark about 60 000 up front obviously not paying myself or anything and then maxing out cards different things of the sort to get us to that Austin location got it open obviously Austin Texas is a very receptive market for plant-based exceptionally well right off the bat what were your sales so at first in Austin we were doing only about ten thousand dollars a week over about a 90-day period that got up to about twenty three thousand dollars a week and it became a really really good store for us because that stores about 27 profit margin as we continue to scale going into next year I have out 18 additional locations we're going to be opening but we have the foundation to do 24. it seems to me I'm sorry to be doubtful sure and I'm an optimist yeah but it seems way way too spectacular for me I'm confused as to how so fast like figuring out where these locations would be getting some type of real estate deal onboarding a team and then for your locations in other cities like what and building it out I thrive in chaos I'm an operator curious what is your debt to have done all of that so fast yeah so I raise uh 1.75 million back in June out of 17.5 million valuation off a single investor that Capital can take us up through the end of next year back to your question when you ask like how is it done covid obviously was devastating for a lot of people you had a lot of Nationals that liquidated I thought of it as an opportunity to go in and get those leases you were getting a great rate we got great rates I signed 10-year deals wow of course you did yeah what's your background I mean you are like you know like with all of this so I grew up super low income family my dad was a bus driver and my mom she was a cook at our elementary I got made fun of my whole life for my mom being our elementary cook and so I wanted nothing to do with the restaurant business a college came around needed money became a delivery driver at a Pizza Hut and my personality and my drive I moved up really quick and through all the positions supervisor managers Etc I caught myself in a Great Divide because I wanted to continue in the qsr space but I just recently turned vegetarian at that time and I had an opportunity to go work for a regional company out San Antonio that was plant-based and they were wanting to scale quickly in our scale we went from one location increased sales by 72 percent within six months open up three additional locations so this in part like I said earlier I want to find out real quick validity and scalability Lucas let me take a stab at it okay I'm a pragmatic investor Financial balance sheet guy I'm very impressed with your executional skills I believe you it's this rush to open Eunice is quite impressive but you're asking me to pay you a valuation as if you've already achieved a 10 million run rate I'm choking on it not the chicken I'm choking on the valuation I'm having a real hard time with it yeah I got to give you three and a half million dollars which is a serious chunk of change I get basically nothing I get a tip in equity and as you finance if it's not going to be debt Equity I get diluted further down I feel like I'm getting deep fry like it's just it's it's brutal I can't go there I'm out I'm out appreciate that feedback let me jump in as well what you've accomplished is great but I've got two problems one plant-based does not mean healthy sure there's nothing healthy about what you're doing right and to me that's going to fall off Trend very quickly I think over the next two to three years it's going to go the opposite direction where plant-based and healthy have to go together that's a challenge in my mind that plus the valuation I'm out okay I respect that and I understand the healthy uh aspect of that um our concept is a build built around accessibility and affordability for the average American does it cost average I think we know what a chicken sandwich costs our average menu item is 650. I'm going to say man you know it's so fast it's like you I I got the truck after I got the truck we did this I I thrive in chaos and that's how I succeed and now we're here we're here we're here I think it's too much of a risk especially for what your ass is for me so for that reason I'm out is there a number that makes more sense to you that may not be such a high valuation that you're more comfortable making that um you know investment in listen here to make a deal with a partner I'm not here for a commercial I'm not here for the prime time through the field here uh you remind me of the business called Tom and she probably seven years ago they came into Shark Tank great guys great operation uh they had two stores when they came in here a truck in the store in St Louis within two years I had 35 within four years they lost everything they not only lost their business they lost both houses I'm not suggesting that to you but they were too darn fast too darn fast so fast and all my buttons are going up okay so the idea that you're building a business so that you could be worth a lot and the idea that you're moving so fast it's like the farthest thing that I could ever feel comfortable with and even go to bed at night and sleep I wouldn't be able to do so for those reasons about I appreciate that I really do and you know I I think on the one hand I can see I understand where your mind is going it's like look what I did I was smart I was Scrappy I went into real estate where no one else had it so I got tenured locked in great rates but you're like a tornado right so you don't know what's going to happen when that touch is down because you want to keep going the Cyclone's still going and that's scary to me and your valuations astronomically High I'm out I get that it's high and again I'm looking for a partnership here 2.5 million two months yeah it's like too much I mean if you come in here for 500 000 might have worked but not this I'm sorry Lucas thank you ", "Hampton Adams": "next up is a better version of a must-have for athletes [Music] [Music] sharks what is up my name is Seneca Hampton I'm from Las Vegas Nevada baby and today I'm seeking 500 000 in exchange for 10 equity and my company Hampton Adams okay sharks have you played Sports then you know there is one product one piece of equipment that almost every athlete uses without fail some people just won't perform without it allow me to introduce you to one of the greatest Creations on planet Earth I present athletic but not just any athletic tape sharks this is Hampton Adams baby now watch this ah it's 45 pounds here oh yeah but wait wait more oh there's more you know that tape that's so strong that you got to use the jaws of life or be a bodybuilder to tear it not here baby we fixed that watch this [Music] by simply listening to athletes we've developed an entire line of sports medicine products specifically for the athlete trainer and physical therapist so sharks who wants to roll with me to take the World by storm wow well great great good presentation thank you thank you so in front of you guys you'll see a sample of our eight pack of athletic tape it's one of our best sellers so we sell all sports Tates that is all that we sell and we actually do pretty pretty well I think I bet with those numbers you tossed out I think you're doing right oh the numbers yeah the numbers sales about twenty four thousand on sale what that's it yeah yesterday yesterday [Music] so you're gonna so last time we've sold about 12.2 million dollars oh wow and I say we I mean me I'm a one-man show is that is that one year's worth of sales one year this year year to date 5 million five million yeah so what distributor are you using so we sell primarily through Amazon so tell us how you got there because that's your magic sauce right yeah like five million is unbelievable thank you this year we'll close out 6.2 6.5 so what are you gonna make on the 6.2 uh about 20 percent ah so therein lies the rub right because these should have a lot of margins so ad spend right that's there um about 20 of our margin is in ads so you said you're gonna do six to seven million So when you say 20 is that your pre-tex net earnings yeah so that's neat that's ebitda um all of that goes right back into inventory and so therein lays the problem right it's it's a beast that's your constantly so you've got the big tape people can do the same thing like what's making yours stand out some of this tape that you use right people are allergic and they'll have rashes or pull their hair out right so there's a different adhesive that we actually have in our tape it's not proprietary but no one's used it in the way that we're using that's that's the secret stuff yeah so there's no patent on here probably no there's no pad it takes a lot of learning in the advertising and SEO space yeah so what was the process you went through there to get to this answer that about seven years ago I started at a company's customer service rep and they were selling light bulbs and it was a similar model and I just dedicated myself and I spent 80 hours a week just working and getting paid to learn and I grinded it out for three years I said I think I figured this out I think I know how to do it and so I went to look for a product for myself and I grew up playing football and so I'd used a lot of athletic tape I wanted to learn how to become wealthy how do I build wealth if you knew where I came from you'd be like there's no reason you should be standing here right now where did you come from so I'm from La originally [Music] um and I have four brothers four sisters and there are days where we go to Burger King grab a one dollar burger slice it in four and that was dinner we grew up like that motels sleeping out of cars and I was just like this this ain't it and as I got older I was like you know what I'm gonna dedicate myself to figuring this out and so I learned how you build wealth start a business start a business you need to sell your product and so I learned sales so what do you need the 500 000 for it's a cash flow business and so my orders I don't order one time at the beginning of the year I'm ordering every month and getting shipments every month to be able to take the cash they're giving into the next order and the next order you're basically breaking even basically to scale it on a cash basis yeah but as long as your sales are growing it's like you're feeding the dragon like exactly it just keeps on gotta keep feeding it and so I never get out of the spot where it's like if something goes wrong this will all come tumbling Seneca you know there's a bunch of companies buying smaller companies and rolling them up as in anybody approached you to acquire you to have I get I don't know how many of those emails from those people and why haven't you pursued any of that um because I'm on the fence of should I sell it or should I keep it going if I keep it going then sell it wow I gotta tell you I love business and I love every business I started but I learned a long time ago the best time to sell is when you don't think you need to sell them when you don't need the money you're kind of on the verge of that honestly yeah if you actually get much more successful your cash problem may actually get much and worse yeah yeah if you have to stress every month about that next month it's time to sell yeah right but the good news is whatever you get for it now you've got the formula I got a question Robert would you buy it would you buy the business [Applause] um I love the business I'm not going to give you the premium price for it you're the right guy you're gonna do this again look I'm not going to invest because you you should sell this business if you've done it you've proven it and like Mark said use your knowledge for the next one congratulations thank you I'm out thank you so much so so when you sell this will you come work for me if you have me yeah it's great you did it the exact right way and your problem is you're stuck in that wheel where you just can't get off you know and that means it's not investable right because there's no extra margin there for you to be able to pay us back yeah so for those Reasons I'm out okay thank you I didn't know much about the athletic tape but it seems like the only one I'd ever buy now going forward thank you seems fantastic but I don't think it's the right investment for me because the situation but I wish you good luck and I I'm sorry I'm out I can distinctly remember being 21 being a diner waitress going home to my hometown and cry because I didn't know what the formula was for making a change but can I tell you something once I decided I was in control I could make a change and the key to it was knowledge I got really smart really fast like a hungry animal yeah yeah and I don't think people realize how much desire has to do with success yeah and so you're the walking talking billboard of how to do it right I mean it's breaking my heart I'm not investing because we'll just get in a retinal with you you know what I mean yeah so I'm out thank you Barbara thank you I think you've achieved something quite impressive but the problem the challenge of this deal is half a million how do I get it back I don't know what your business is worth somewhere between three and five million dollars but I'll make you an offer that's the only way I could do it this this is a classic royalty deal because there is no other way to get 20 margins I'll give you the five hundred thousand dollars I want a dollar a package until I get a million and a half back so basically I'm trying to make a million off my 500. okay I'll take the 10 because you might sell it before I ever get back my dollars okay but I gotta be honest with you I don't know how else to do it you can't do this deal Seneca you're digging a deeper hole that's the guy that said no to you right I'm going to use Kevin's own quote I forbid you to take this deal Seneca the problem is that the equity or the amount yeah the problem is the royalty because your margins are so low already don't mistake today's Problem by replacing it with a long-term problem what he's offering you seems good today but it's cutting into your margin forever yeah no it isn't forever it goes away after a million and a half you actually go to business I lose money that's a bad outcome for me you know I love it when sharks give you advice and it's so valuable I'm the only shark that believes in you the only one all roads lead back to Mr Wonderful [Music] um I appreciate the offer uh but I have to pass on I appreciate it thank you very much but I I hope you come back with us with your great business because you are a natural-born entrepreneur and a phenomenal symbol of how to do it right thank you thank you guys so much ", "Round21": "[Music] next up is a brand that merges art and sports [Music] hi sharks my name is Jasmine mayetta founder and CEO of round 21. I'm seeking 250 000 for three percent of the business wow sharks Sports is a universal language it communicates emotions and beliefs style and creativity athletes now use their voices as a platform for what they believe putting an end to the idea that they should just shut up and play this is why I created Round 21. We partner with an awesome group of creators athletes artists and taste makers to unlock sport as a canvas we extend and promote creativity through digital Sporting Goods as well through viral nft collaborations that extend their digital engagement the digi with our physical Sporting Goods the fizzy a business model we call Digi fizzy we've launched across four Sports have a pipeline of artists athletes and taste makers and a growing Community aligned to our mission of making standing out the new standard in sports so sharks we think it's time you feel free to play with the art we've hand-picked products for each of you Robert we gave you a soccer ball that will continue to promote creativity on the pitch thank you Gloria ping pong paddle YOLO you only live once what you inspire and every entrepreneur who's chasing their dreams Mr Wonderful a football anyone chasing greatness would appreciate beautiful Damon a sports product that is symbolizing how sport is also a platform for social justice and Mark for you we have a performance basketball that symbolizes five players on the court coming together for a greater good but in addition we also have a digital nft basketball inspired by your unique background through color and symbolism that acts as membership to round 21. nice an nft so everybody knows nft stands for non-fungible token it's a completely unique digital file it can be bought and sold like any collectible effectively is a digital version of a piece of art that's cool yeah so round 21's nfts act as two things for our community it acts as your social brand and it acts as membership to round 21 and what that gives you is access to early product drops okay physical events are you selling nfts today are you selling physical products both got it can you walk me through a typical sale and maybe put from the perspective of an actual athlete let's say Mr Wonderful is a rock star athlete which I am obviously I come to you Jasmine I say okay I want to make a statement about entrepreneurship I'm an athlete I got a million followers what happens we bring in artists from the outside how do you split the revenue between you the artist and the athlete this basketball is an example is 15 to make and we sell it for 59.99 retail the artist gets two options they either get a flat fee up front or they get 10 share in revenue of every unit sold and so can you walk us through the overall Revenue how much have you sold in physical goods and nfts yeah so I've sold 354 000 life today which is 15 months of physical Goods units or dollars sorry that's dollars okay and how much is nfts on top of the 354. right now the nfts are growing into 20K of our total revenue that's above and beyond the 354. so it's small it's very small very small so tell us about you how did you come up with this in the first place so I have to go back to my roots I'm born and raised in small town Oklahoma two parents from India where being different sometimes meant you didn't belong and I found who I was through basketball I played in high school I played overseas and then I coached at the Collegiate and high school level I then transitioned to the marketing side of sports which led me to marketing leadership roles at Reebok Hasbro oh wow Under Armor I led marketing for six years and most recently was vice president of brand at Peloton wow what are your sales year to date we're on track where run rate is 510 000 how much you're going to make on that we're currently at a gross profit level 73 000 gross profit or not at the product level netting we are not profitable as a company how much are you burning we're burning about ten thousand dollars a month right now how much money have you raised so I just closed around at 1.39 million I raised on a safe at a 6.25 post money what are the terms of your safe 6.25 post money safe standard y combinator safe you know I think you are so impressive and so spot on as far as an investment for me I think that some of my fellow sharks might be a better partner for you because they know more about sports than I do for those reasons I think I will go out because I think you'll have even someone stronger to help support you Jasmine I have a huge amount of respect for your background really really impressive and what a unique business model is it going to work I don't know but the road to revenue is not clear for me before you go out before you go out I want to talk about our strategic Partnerships at the wholesale level for volume yeah Jasmine I'm not your guy for this I'm sorry I'm out the other real deal I think nft is going to be around forever everybody's going to own one but I'm trying to educate myself still on them and at a buy-in price of 250 000 I'll be giving you that for tuition I wouldn't add any value at this moment um it's a little too early for me to get a full grasp Damon we are betting on the passion people have for sports the revenue is rooted in physicals the nft is in the physicals this is Sport fashion this is absolutely self-expression and a key part is the really attractive part but I don't know enough about it so I'm out higher we third PO with the largest sporting boarding retailer in America they want to co-create product with us in 2022 and Beyond they also have an open order for next year that just came in this morning of a hundred thousand dollars but see but those numbers aren't big enough to scale particularly with your valuation look we do some of the stuff with the Mavs I do a lot of stuff with unlocking nfts it'd be somewhat competitive and so for those Reasons I'm out okay Jasmine the sporty shark is left I own the domain for nft I own the URL I built a business around it with lots of Partners we have reserved all the S P 500 companies and so that part fits with what I'm doing and I've already invested a lot in I'm trying to figure out how to make that work so that when you offer any athlete an nft profile it goes up on the website but if you own all the 500 companies you didn't get all their permission are you a trolley we've reserved it for them and they can decide to use their control you reserved it for them witnessing a troll in Real Life Look I I have those domains and my point is I don't steal it from them if they want to work with us great but I'm not going to go to work for you Jasmine for three percent because your business is this and it's early it's it's startup you're very impressive but I'm not doing it for three percent okay okay that's just not enough to get me out of bed to go work for you so I'm gonna make you an offer I'm going to do the 250 000 for 15. you guys say yes to that you should take that deal you've got to I don't have any flexibility but basically I'm giving you a

stores well so you want help in getting retail distribution correct does this eradicate all of the bed bugs this has been designed actually as an early detection it's your vision that would go to a hotel with one of these put under my bed and say whoa i gotta change rooms there's bugs in here we've actually even had that happen whoa everyone keeps asking the same question why are we so infested because there is no really good early detection system is it tested and proven or is this your claim we've tested it worked with a couple endomologists dermatologists as well as myself came up with the formula we just had a housing authority for instance we sent them a case of 144 traps at their request for a sample three months ago they just placed an order last week for 22 000 traps because of the successful results wow it's not toxic in any way it's non-toxic and pesticide-free buggy badges patent as a design in 34 countries the trademark of the name buggy beds and the logo itself is in 42

website and they just picked us up for 60 of their stores that we just shipped out this week oh you never said that before with this product correct we also just got a purchase order from 75 burlington coat factories as well can i say one other thing on the 150 000 in sales we have a hundred thousand a profit nine for six months since you've introduced it correct 150 000 for six months you're valuing the company you're asking for 125 000 for seven percent correct correct you're saying the company is valued at around 1.75 why are you valuing the company at that that's a great question before we launched i was offered five million dollars for the trademarks and the patents from a company whoa wait a minute and you turned that down yes what shame on you are you uh i'm mrs wonderful in business i know what we have here i know the value we did the test market in the 29 stores at shoprite they contacted us the entire corporation sold out in 10 days in 29 stores we just

know you guys are the real deal i'm itching to do this deal [Applause] okay ladies ladies i want you to step outside for me okay because i wanted to have a little shark discussion okay okay boys and girl we all want part of this deal so what do you want to go up to i'd like to see what they're offering i think they're very interested it depends on what value they're going to bring to the table i mean depending you know i'm not going to give up something what we have we have tremendous value right i want to avoid a shark fight i want a piece of the deal i know everybody else is thinking the same thing but i want collusion she turned down five million dollars as you turn down five million do you really want to go in about the dollars or getting all five of us we have to give her something of tremendous value all five of us are tremendous value i'd rather have a bigger chunk for myself to be honest with you i'm always uh wary when kevin does all the talking and mark doesn't say a word i'm just listening i'm just listening are you in on this i have nothing to say let's buy a big piece of this business is everybody interested we have to give her something of tremendous value all five of us are tremendous value well i'd rather have a bigger chunk for myself to be honest with you mark are you in on this i'll be brutally honest i'm gonna let you guys talk i'm gonna listen and see what they say and decide from there well it's not gonna go anywhere unless somebody starts with an offer okay well i'll start with an offer and i'll say anybody who wants to join me is welcome in ladies so what would really get me excited about working with both of you ladies is 25 of the company and i'm willing to give you 250 000 for it but i also respect my fellow sharks and i don't want to compete with them so i will invite any one of them into that deal they may elect to join me or they may not we'll see what happens now any other offers from anyone i'm willing to come in on kevin's deal okay [Music] curious to see what you think of kevin and damon's offer um the equity is a little harder than what we wanted to give up but if another shark comes in on that because it's strategic it's the same i want to work on the walmart deal i've lived through rolling out products in walmart it's very hard i want to help you 7-eleven has 40 000 stores globally so i can help you with that i want to speak for the value we bring beyond just the cash i mean there's a lot of value in having us as partners we have to get paid for that too everybody has to wet their beak mark are you in on this i have nothing to say can we discuss what you would be bringing as far as other help you can for starters they would bring their huge egos with them ladies i'm gonna give you an offer now you have to accept it now all right i'm not gonna wait i don't have time for the little boy games so i'm gonna give you 150 000 for 15 of the business but i'm going to tell you what i'm going to bring to the table i had to learn how to break into the big box stores i didn't know a darn thing about it three years ago i know it inside and out but you know what else you girls are cutting out the same cloth we don't need these boys to help us find our success they weren't there when we were struggling they're not going to be there at the end and that's the truth all right barbara let's just go to your blood-sucking offer please reiterate you want to know what else is there an offer at the end of this i already gave the offer make sure the phone bill is in there because as long-winded as she is you will be on the phone forever i realize they're both giving you basically the same value of the company ladies do you accept the offer or not keep in mind murray you've you've got the offer from damian and kevin for 250 000 for 25 and mark and i haven't made any offer yet okay so barbara are you in or out my offer's off the table i'm out too bad i love your business you guys have everything under control basically the issue really is can you run fast enough to keep up with everything you have no idea i think the best deal is for the four of us and actually if barbara wants to come back into five of us on you're being a gentleman no i'll leave the boys club up to the boys the only reason i would uh make my own offer is to screw over mark cuban yeah but i think each of us can add something as mark said i'm in on the deal with mark damon and kevin 250 000 for 25 come on barbara barbara you should come in i'm gonna tell you something i don't even like these guys but just to make your life pleasant i'm going to jump back in the deal before she's training them you have all five sharks quarter million dollars for 25. never happened ever okay yes or no can we take one minute

bugs in every hotel [Music] yes yeah we get it babe i'll to them you ", "Kreyol Essence": "next in the tank is an Island's best kept secret for skin care [Music] bonjour sharks my name is Eve Carmon peruse my name is Stefan Gene Baptiste and I'm the lucky honey of this beautiful woman right here we live in Sunny Miami Florida and we are seeking four hundred thousand dollars for 10 of our company crayol Essence sharks let's get right to it Crayola Essence has the liquid gold of the Caribbean the most nourishing oil you'll ever want to use for your hair Skin and Body we're talking about a rare Beauty secret called [Music] green muskriti also known as Haitian castor oil let's show you how we make liquid gold after six months of harvesting the best castle seeds are hand selected by women Artisans the seeds are then pressed using a pestle and mortar then they are roasted and simmered to Perfection after the oil has decanted like a fine wine a masters used to filter out any debris leaving you with the raw and pure Haitian castor oil we all love so whether it's moisturizing kinky curly hair promoting thicker lashes or brows or relieving dry itchy skin we have the most high performing natural products for you but wait there's more Crayola Essence creates work for over 300 farmers and women producers so sharks who's ready to help us build a billion dollar business and share with the world the true beauty that Haiti has to offer another sharks thank you guys so much nicely done guys thank you Stefan is now going to make sure that you guys get your own boxes from the Caribbean and you get to experience the liquid gold thank you [Music] thank you [Music] so what you guys have in your boxes it's a collection of some of our best sellers Lori you're holding up right now is our mango papaya rum punch smells heavenly yeah it transports you to the Caribbean Damon which you have right now it's the mango papaya rum punch body cream for your skin Oh that smells really good oh my gosh and you have Haitian Grounded Coffee in the body wash and it's 100 natural and I have to say no sticky feel whatsoever there's no sticky feeling so there's a lot of creams and lotions and things out on the market I'm very curious to know what makes yours different or better what makes Haitian castor oil so unique is a composition that only the oil has which is called racinoleic acid it's going to go deeper into the skin instead of sitting on top so this is particularly important for those with eczema psoriasis where they need a lot of hydration he's just castor oil different than regular castor oil is it somehow unique so the way castor oil is normally processed what many and they use other you're hiring people in Haiti right so can you talk more about those programs and what you're doing there absolutely so our supply chains actually starts directly out of Haiti we actually have our own Farm about 12 hectares where we work with the farmers they work for us directly but then we also work with Cooperative cooperatives most Farmers live on less than one dollar a day we are paying double that to make sure that anytime they're coming with Caster seeds we give it an above market price got it good okay so what are your sales so we started the business in 2014 we did 135 000 okay in 2016 we did forty thousand dollars worth of sales what happened at the time in 2016 we were focusing on actually selling the casserole in bulk um and one of our top clients actually walked away we were still building the supply chain still just we had one client to represent the majority it was actually the majority yes so we decided to Pivot in 2017 we decided to go direct to Consumer and from there our sales jumped to three hundred and twenty seven thousand dollars in 2018 we did a million dollars in sales and what's this year look nice this year we project that we will close at 2 million why will we have such a significant jump in Revenue at 2 million so the reason that we feel that we're going to get to 2 million is that we just secured a contract from the largest beauty retailer in the country Alta Ulta yeah and they're going to be launching Us in all 1200 doors you have a PO in hand so we just finished the contract and then we should be getting the PO in the next few weeks how do people know what this is that's a really good question I want to walk by this and really not know anything and that's why we spend lots of time making sure that we educate our Retail Partners and their staff the other thing is social media so right now we have over a hundred thousand followers between all of our social media outlets and our customer base they're showing before and after pictures which we have here that we would love to show you guys this actually helps grow hair yes well yes it helps to promote hair growth that's what we always say we say promote hair growth so male pattern baldness is a major issue and we have one of our customers again unsolicited who started using our Haitian castor oil and in three months you could see at the crown of his head that his hair started to grow and by the way what does this one jar cost so the retail price is about 22 dollars for our scented and 16 for our original castor oil and it cost you what to make it it cost me two dollars and fifty cents to make will you be profitable this year we are profitable what did you make in 2018 on the 1 million we did about 300 000 on that and do you have any debt now we do have debt how much do you have three hundred thousand dollars in that what I love about this business is you you could sell whatever you want to sell extremely persuasive but interestingly it's also what I don't like about the business your business is too damn dependent on you selling the product that's just not scalable I'm out guys congratulations with what you've been able to accomplish I just don't see this being worth four million dollars amount all right so it's just such a competitive space and I don't have enough expertise in the beauty space I'm out Damon sorry to hear that you showed those pictures of hair growth have you done any testing any uh laboratory or trials or clinicals or anything so clinical Tech is actually part of the marketing spend and part of what you know we're looking at that to me all it does is signal a red flag because when you put out anything like that into the consumer Market you really have to have a lot of proof backing that up because you don't have the clinicals so I'm sorry but the customers are giving their experience as a product person and as a shark there's tons of fake scanners absolutely absolutely ads because they'll Photoshop our images and they'll say that we back that and we don't it all so now I have to be triply careful well Lori's red flag might be this character's greatest attraction so I look at it and say what you do have is sales a potential of 2 million in sales if this works out with this retailer there's a lot of risk in this thing I don't think the business is worth four million dollars today I'm sorry I'll give you the four hundred thousand dollars I want thirty seven percent okay thank you so much for that offer would you do 400 000 for 20 percent never never never this has risks all businesses look I'm impressed by you now we're having a tough love discussion it's about money I want to make money 37 is too rich can you meet me in the middle at 25 no no so look you have to make a decision I'll still have the four hundred thousand dollars when you walk out that door and someone else will still have me that you know account where I'm gonna make two million this year and go on to make 5 10 and make sure that we get to 100 million dollars because that's what businesses of our Rank and size have done and I want you to be part of that business you have to make a decision but 37 is way too high there's no way to get that much you know if you don't like it don't take it lots of risks that's why they call it the Shark Tank foreign [Laughter] yes or no foreign you are very emotional can you share why God that time period was really tough for us in 2016. I mean even to the point where we almost just close the business down it challenged our relationship you know feeling as if we sort of failed to build our community failed ourselves it's not just about the great products it's about the mission of helping to create a blueprint for poverty alleviation which is a huge problem around the world it's my culture it's my identity it's it's it's everything that my parents sacrificed so get us here I mean we shouldn't be here but you are here and you have an offer what have you decided to do [Music] Mr Wonderful would you be interested in thinking through this doing a royalty you know royalty yes that brings a tear to my eye I'd like to hear what do you have in mind 15 cents for every bottle sold that so I don't have any Equity it's just a royalty it's just a royalty deal tell you what final offer I want 25 cents royalty on every unit sold in perpetuity and five percent equity and you have a deal [Music] foreign [Music] wow what a turnaround I didn't see that coming congratulations thank you wow what a surprise twist boy she's got a lot of fire in that belly we did a royalty deal no I was not expecting Mr Wonderful yes to be

industry it's a fitness program that makes Fitness fun for people of all ages shapes and sizes when my wife and I created the program we were homeless this is the motel that we actually stayed at when we lost our home being here motivated me to go I gotta get out of this my wife and I have risked everything to make this program come to life right left run back to the right left come on I want to prove that I can make a name for myself my own I've had a lot of Heroes in life I know that we have a great idea and I need the Sharks to help me bring this idea to the world [Music] thank you hi sharks my name is Billy Blanks Jr and I'm the creator of Billy Blanks Jr's dance with me I'm here today asking for a hundred thousand dollar investment for 20 stake in my company you know I grew up in a fitness family my father is Billy Blanks the creator of taebo and the biggest Fitness selling DVD in history but growing up in a fitness family I always felt like it was a little too serious you know the boot camp thing I wasn't about screaming in people's face I I danced my whole life on Broadway and I always felt well dancing keeps me in shape I have a great time dancing why can't it be fun Billy Blanks you just dance with me is an all-inclusive workout for people of all ages shapes and sizes it includes all styles of dance from hip-hop to Bollywood to line dancing to the Tango to hula dancing African you name it we do it so I want to show you guys what dance with me is all about all right I brought my wife and my uh co-directed the program share Catherine blanks and I got some students here everyday people okay now I want you guys to dance in your seats a little bit if you can all right just move with us arms yeah I like that bar I like that come on Mr Wonderful just Groove with us all right so the first step we're going to start off with a little bit of Hip Hop roaming like this roll it out come on now if you're at home I want you to get up and dance with us too all right come on roll it yes so this is the roll we're gonna go hip hop style now we're gonna move on to the next one we're gonna go shoulder shoulder down what's up shoulder shoulders down what's up come on up what's so let's go to that come on David what's up now double time here we go shut up shuttle down what's up come on yes we're gonna move on to a little bit of disco I know Mr Mark Cuban used to teach disco yeah all right come on come on come on down here get out there right here go Mark go Mark right here [Applause] [Music] I think I lost 20 pounds well that was fun high energy thank you very much so you know from the taebo experience that it's very expensive to launch a product into the market I'm assuming that's why you're here for the hundred thousand dollars right actually I'm here for my instructor certification program I have DVDs two DVDs out right now they're at all the Walmarts targets Best Buy and with Lionsgate I have just signed a contract with them for four more DVDs to come out in the next two years okay so let's get some clarification here those are your consumer products and now you're looking to create an instructor certification program so these are two separate businesses then right it's two separate businesses what it is is uh you know I have peop the emails that I'm getting are people going I've been working out to the DVDs now how do I do the live class what I'm trying to do is train the teachers to teach the workouts so somebody can do it in New York someone can do it in LA so tell us about the business model there what happens is the instruction will come they pay 250 bucks uh they take the two-day course and then from there they're certified for one year but Billy how do you scale it how do you make it go wide when we go to each City we select 10 master trainers that when we leave they continue to host certifications my goal is to have a person in every city by this time next year and what's the revenue of the combined business uh right now I don't know what they just released the DVDs just released you're asking us to invest in this call it the wholesale business right but you're not giving us any part of the retail business see if I give you a hundred thousand dollars I want you to work your ass off you know every minute of every day so we both get a return on our investment Billy look for me Mark hit the nail on the head I think the brand is you you build one you build the other they've got to be combined can you combine it yeah I would combine them I would combine them because to me it's that important if you guys believe in me I'm not sitting here trying to keep everything in my pocket Billy can you tell me more about tybo with your dad I was not familiar with that at all yeah tybo uh was something my dad created that was a karate kickboxing workout it's the highest selling Fitness DVD in history did he invest in your business if it's such a big brand he should be the biggest believer in the world very good question uh you know some family structures are different family structures where the parents make money and the parents share that wealth with their family when you earn it he's making me earn it so without his backup how have you made that work by yourself uh well my wife who was dancing here with me today uh she's been a support system and also you know for me you know when we built this workout my wife and I were homeless you were homeless yes did your dad know you were homeless I mean are you estranged from your dad uh not to ask you a personal question you're not that close to him is what you're saying not that close but now things have seemed to change a little bit in a better direction do you have the rights to use the name Billy Blank Jr in all manners your dad's not going to come out of the woodwork and say look I'm Billy Blanks forget the junior part seriously a single question right it hasn't been an issue he knows about this contract we had the same agent so it hasn't been an issue thus far Billy let me tell you how I feel I think it's great you take total responsibility for yourself independent of your dad when you get there gonna feel so much better than that as a business it's not clear to me so I'm out Billy look I have such respect for your story trying to come out of the shadow of your dad thank you but as a value business partner you know I'm not your guy I'm out all right I think you're a great guy Billy I admire all stick-to-itiveness that's good but it's not an investment for me I'm a sharks are out damond and Mark are Billy's last chance to make a deal the beauty of coming into the tank is we all are experts in different areas I have a very tight strategic relationship with Zumba 12 million people do it a week and maybe this is an asset to them I would offer if Mark is willing to come in with me a hundred thousand dollars for fifty percent contingent on Billy blank's name and zumba's approval and willing to work with you that way you can get to 12 million people immediately tomorrow Mark so are you in I'm in [Music] and that's your offer that is my offer I love Zumbas but the difference is it's just Latin Style so there are guys there are people who go hey you know I don't just want to do Latin no I'm not making this a Zumba product I'm asking can this be the Billy Blanks Junior dance with me through their distribution life is always about distribution that's it see I just feel that I've worked so hard to create something that is different it's completely different what he's saying is this is a way to accelerate you very quickly now Billy Blanks Jr is making the circuit through all the Zumba classes and doing the training and if we can make it work that's a contingency you'll get a hundred thousand dollars plus fifty percent of whatever we're able to sell Zumba on that's a hell of a deal really what's your concern I mean they're taking you to 12 million people I'm thinking you should be it's just because there's right now with you know literally there are people who go this is the workout they do with them and and for me in my opinion okay Billy I see you're having a challenge with this and what I'm gonna say is that can I talk to my wife real quick about it she's here yes because I was I'm about to exit so please talk to your wife all right I don't think he got it I don't think he got it either one offer and it's from Damon I want to ask you about it Damon Works closely with Zumba okay and so they want 50 they'll do the hundred thousand dollars but they want to go to Zumba and see if we can be an extension of their brand they said they said they don't understand why we won't do it because it brings us to 12 men 12 million people in audience you know we're trying to separate Our Brands so but they're saying you know you know this is a smart deal 50 of the company this is difficult because you're the brand on why wouldn't zumba just create their own dance program they might they may say Dame and beat it but they don't have the him as a brand and he does have brand value all right okay so do you accept that offer [Music] I want to plead with you guys uh oh I really truly believe in what it is that I've built thus far if I'm willing to bundle in all my stuff at the 50 I'm willing to do that and to work my behind off not bundling with another workout because they've built their brand and so my purpose is I want to build my brand I believe in what it is your brand I don't think you really liked it no I understand that but I'm saying it's still coming through it's it's building their brand no no it's not building their brand and at this point at this point I'm going to ask you to trust us we're taking you in to somebody who could accelerate your brand and help you get in front of more people far more quickly than you could on your on your own we're going to let you look at it and say yes or no I understand I just want to be in the position zumba's in I want to be able to get you there really think of them think of Zumba as a delivery boy in delivering your brand to a whole bunch of customers is it a deal you would do with these two guys yes I would yes Billy what are you gonna do uh you know I don't think it's the right deal to do all right we wish you the best Billy good luck thank you guys so much for having me thank you guys so much wow I don't think he quite got it though that's a mistake I I'm I want to help him for himself now he's killing himself anyways I'm sending you both an invoice for my time on that one next you know what if I don't do this I'm gonna regret it where are you going I'm gonna do the deal Sharon Sharon Catherine how are you why don't we sit down for a second I've never done this before I think that you don't understand the opportunity that we gave you let me explain it to your wife we are offering in regards to if Zumba will accept if they want to take Billy Blanks Jr Dance with Me program and distribute it in their pipeline not making it a Zumba product it's exactly like if you went to Walmart and they said we're going to put you on this Shelf you're not pushing Walmart and if you didn't like the deal then we don't do the deal and you're back to where you are now you understand what I'm saying so this is what I'm trying to explain to you you walked away from a valuable deal like that but a lot of times the only thing that is more important than the number is the person you understand and I wouldn't do that to you and your lovely wife I understand can you reconsider the deal because you make me want to help you you don't realize what this means to us that you're coming to us and I would definitely take that don't make me cry I'm sorry because thank you guys thank you I will do the best for you that I possibly can I promise you that all right get my sweat on you sorry tell them thank you I will do thank you [Music] I'm kind of overwhelmed right now because it's I just feel like it's the road to what we've been fighting for my wife and I it's so proud of you I'm so grateful because I know there are times in life where people don't get Second Chances so I'm grateful for that and I just think it's going to be a great deal [Music] dive into the Shark Tank Youtube channel And subscribe now ", "Coffee Meets Bagel": "hi my room I'm Darwin I'm Sue and we're

started our own business let's talk about our upcoming marketing initiative we believe we have something very big on our hands something that can potentially change lives without the money from the Sharks we won't be able to execute on our growth plan not to mention to disappoint our family after all that they have sacrificed [Music] hello my name is Arun Taiwan and Sue and we're the king sisters from San Francisco today we're raising five hundred thousand dollars in exchange for five percent equity in our company coffee meets Bagel is here to profoundly change how people discover and fall in love sharks I know what you're thinking it's another dating site we all know online dating sucks why because it treats people as a piece of information you search for from a huge database people want to go back to time of happenstance where you just stumble upon someone special maybe through a friend that's why we created coffee meets Bagel we took the proven concept of daily flash sale sites immersed it with social networking elements to create the highest quality dating service for singles here is how it works every day at noon we create one perfect match who is a friend of a friend you have a 24 hours to review their profile information and choose to like or pass on the match Mutual like leads to a private chat line that expires in seven days the secret to success in online dating is winning over women single women are tired of signing up for dating websites only to get hit on by creepy strangers bombarding them with disgusting messages and that is why women love coffee meets Bagel since our national launch we've been growing a double digits monthly and now with your help and investment we can help singles all around the world so sharks who's going to be our perfect match so it's very interesting what does the bagel got to do with it let's just be honest there's still a little bit of stigma with online dating so our customers actually love the fact that our name doesn't seem to you know do anything to do with dating service when they talk about it nobody really knows what they're talking about hey hey everything bagel today today I got a stale Bagel today it's like a code for them oh that's cool so tell us about your business model our core service is free but there's premium features that you can unlock using virtual currency in the form of coffee beans like what one of the most popular items we have is called open sesame we actually tell you how many mutual friends you have between you and your match we don't tell you who they are what good is that well you buy it it's a mystery a lot of people want to know how am I connected to this person and how much do I pay for the coffee beans each Bean is equivalent to about two cents but open sesame for example it's 95 beans do both parties have to like each other to be a match exactly so this has to be a mutual consent and how do you curate so we have a proprietary machine learning algorithm that takes into consideration all the users data and we require all users to sign up through Facebook so instantly from day one we can learn a lot about the user including their friends but you only source from Facebook you don't use a questionnaire don't you do any of that right now so it literally takes like less than a minute to sign the idea is you don't have to make someone go through the application process exactly the most important question have you met the man of your dreams so um I am yours married with the guy that she met long long time ago I met my current boyfriend on coffee meets Bagel you see the picture of the two of us on the wall I'm meeting a lot of you know interesting people through coffee mix bagels and I'm still looking all right how many users so right now we have several hundred thousand users our business really ramped up about 200 000 or a 700 000. so it's between one and five why just tell us what it is you want an investment you can't not tell us yes but I think that's a good range it gives you a good idea no it doesn't no but why won't you give us the actual number we're actually not sharing the exact user number right now okay I'm out well you gotta share that are you kidding okay what were your sales so last year we made eighty seven thousand dollars but get this this year in the first five months we made 270 000 wow so it's growing very quickly forecast for this calendar year all in at this current rate we will make a million next year we aim to make 10 million dollars all right the million dollars in sales what will you make what's your profit so right now our profit is negative spend a lot of money salaries to pay our developers and do you guys take a salary today right now we take hundred thousand dollar salary each year sorry you take a hundred so three hundred thousand dollars you're drawing out of the business right a year a year a year but that is still a significant pay cut for all of us whatever we're making prior we actually raised 2.8 million dollars in external funding so far wow our notable investor actually is of one of the co-founders of match.com who absolutely love their idea and he was our very first investor on the million dollars how much would you lose this year we'll lose a million dollars you'll lose a million dollars on a million dollars in sales yes which is why we actually have to raise more money because we're trying to ramp up our growth you're projecting 10 million dollars for the second year exactly how much money will you make on that 10 million we will break even on 10 million you'll break even let's go let it go let it go and here's why we plan to bring on about 4 million users next year who's going to generate about 2.50 cents each hence the 10 million and what's your customer acquisition cost 30 cents next year we plan on spending about three to four million dollars on marketing spending and acquire 4 million users so we are assuming a slight increase in customer acquisition costs you know you're an All or Nothing play what do you think for All or Nothing because you're losing so much money you're not really into building a business game you're in the raising money and getting users game I think you've got to hit a home run not saying you're not going to but it's risky I know it is our decision to invest more and accelerate growth but we can't just as well just grow this business as a fascinating dilemma because I hear where you're coming from the Baseline model works you want to pour gasoline on that fire exactly it's a pretty big bet and and while I'm doing it I part with 500 000 and I get five percent one of the problems for me now in Shark Tank in season six is I've come to realize I'm really valuable big time and it's made me very greedy I don't do five percent deals that's worthless to me I wouldn't do this I'm out if we really thought this was all or nothing we would have raised a lot more money from the beginning now we actually have a choice of just growing the business traditionally or raise more money to make this big you've raised a lot of money you're not making money and you're each drawing a hundred thousand dollars that's three hundred thousand dollars out of the business that seems very high salary I mean most people don't make anywhere near that and you're just growing big concern I have also is the fact that somebody else could do this people are knocking off everybody on the internet all the time so for that reason I'm out I think one thing for sure is you're great at raising money thank you I also think this is a site that's needed I think the women I know that have been on the typical website feel like a piece of meat and a meat locker exactly looked over they don't you know it's almost insulting yes this is a site that gives women a little bit more control and I like all of that but I'll tell you what I don't like the break even at 10 million a break even and I'm only only five percent of the stock that's spooky doesn't seem like enough upside for the enormous risk I'd be taking so for those reasons amount thank you let me ask you a question if I offered you 30 million dollars for the company would you take it [Music] all five sharks are out but Mark Cuban has just made the largest offer in Shark Tank history let me ask you a question if I offered you 30 million dollars for the company would you take it [Music] foreign I would not be taking it because we see we see this business going growing as big as Match.com and you know how much revenue they're generating 800 million a year they're becoming a billion dollar Revenue company and we think this model and the product has potential to be as big as match he offered you 30 million dollars and you didn't even Flinch she should feel confident it's a newer ephemeral version of Hot or Not which is brilliant but I don't know how protectable that is well I give you total credit and I think you guys have done some brilliant things I don't think the risk reward is there for me and for those Reasons I'm still out good luck thank you excellent presentation what they say like in dating never settled while 30 million dollars may sound like a lot of money you ain't Mr Mark Cuban because this baby is going to explode ", "Songlorious": "first into the tank is a way to give the most memorable gift [Music] hi sharks I'm Ellen Hodges and I'm Omega taoud and we're seeking 400 000 in exchange for 10 equity in song Glorious do you want to give a gift that you know will get a strong emotional reaction a gift that captures memories a gift that creates new ones greeting cards flowers they all fall flat because they're kind of impersonal and sooner or later end up in the trash that's where song Glorious comes in with a gift that lasts forever so I'm glorious is a website that anyone can use to have a personalized studio quality song made completely from scratch for any occasion all you have to do is go to the website choose a genre tell us your story and one of our artists will have a song created especially for your loved one let us give you a little taste of what you can expect from song Glorious Kevin oh Kevin your bald head reflects me that don't mean that you ain't sexy oh she's selling things on TV yeah sweet Lori her long blonde hair makes me really jelly hey Mark Cuban we don't want to hear crickets Let's Make a Deal and throw in some courtside tickets back in New York City Damon John is making bank Peter Jones from across the pond is here on Shark Tank very good Yay good job so sharks which one of you wants to rock and roll with us into the future Thanksgiving all right good job how does it work so every song is completely unique and made per order so you go to the website you choose a genre you tell us how long you want the song to be we've got options from 30 seconds to three minutes and you know the price depends on those two factors and then you just tell us your story you tell us the occasion and about the person it's for part of the order process you choose the genre and some of them are acoustic genres which are priced a little cheaper and some of them are full production we've got pop rock country rock EDM and then it's up to the artists to provide all the instrumentation what's the price between a 30 second versus a three minute so 30 second is 45 that's what it starts at for an acoustic song and uh for a full three minutes long if it's acoustic 205 dollars and uh if it's a full instrumentation it's 230 dollars so how does it work then so you've got a load of freelance singers yes yes we have about 100 musicians on our team right now and how much do you pay them each time they do a song so we pay them anywhere between 35 to 55 of the songs order cost plus any tips that they get they get 100 of and the average tip is about fifty one dollars what if your sales been to so far since you've launched so uh last year we made 700 000 wow this year today we've made 1.1 million dollars wow you need a million won what do you get to the bottom line by the time bottom line is nine percent profit so nine percent and that's after you guys pay yourselves obviously no that's before Repairs by yourself no well when we started we were living in Brooklyn in apartment with four other roommates and I just basically use my personal credit cards to start to start the website and uh we basically any money we're making we're putting back in how did you come up with this idea so we're both musicians we made a personalized song for one of my friends friends for their wedding before the pandemic hit and then we decided to kind of turn that idea into a website make the songs ourself we hope to do about three songs a week just for fun and some extra money and then put some advertising money behind it because we believed in the idea but then we started getting more orders than we could handle and we were staying up all night in our apartment making music writing music too overwhelmed so and that's at the same time artists were contacting us looking like hey we saw your ad I'm looking for work and we're like join the team because this is a lifelong dream realized to be able to put my passion for music into my career it's it's the best feeling in the world and to do it with you know love of my life now who has knocked you off so far how many competitors you have so there are other businesses that do this it's you know personalized songs have really been around since the singing telegram it's not it's new it seems new but it's very old there are some websites out there that are just one person they typically have long turnaround times and high prices and then the other ones that have a roster of musicians are typically templated songs where they just change a name and a you know is it just the two of you running the company it started just the two of us now we have four full-time employees so where do you see this company going we can copy and paste this model into other languages right now we only do songs in English we really want to dive into the wedding sector as well we do a lot of songs for weddings already but we feel like there's a lot of opportunity there wedding section um and then additionally with the corporate world you know this is we already have a couple companies who are ordering songs all the time anytime somebody gets promoted or hired they buy them a custom song what would you like to use the money for we're going to use it for all the marketing expansions that we're looking for whether it's digital you know television radio Etc the truth is you know we're musicians we're not marketing experts we've come this far but we really need we want to use the 400 000 to professionalize the whole operation exactly but get the feeling and sense that you're not business people you that's why you're here you need help yes get back but do you have a forecast do you have anything any idea of where this could get to we have a general idea from just forecasting regular numbers wise we're looking 2.5 million this year and we're looking out for about 5 million next year so in the UK I used to own a company called red letter days basically it was an experienced company you could buy a recording for whatever you wanted for a birthday for a very very similar we sold it and we made a lot of money one thing that was really interesting is it took off yeah it was really really big but it took off because we decided to make it really simple and your website and your technology you're using is absolutely vital to get that right but I do think with the right backup in terms of technology I think this could be huge particularly for weddings that means so much to hear thank you guys with what's happening in artificial intelligence you've seen you know emulated voices that sound really really really good I have a company called Synthesia and that's all they do is replicate voices so you can take my my voice saying this and convert it to 30 different languages Obama based on the experience that I have in growing businesses like this I could be your perfect partner and that's why I'm going to make you an offer okay but my offer doesn't come cheap I'm going to offer you four hundred thousand dollars but I'd like to share the business with you equally I'd like a third of the business appreciate the offer very much yeah thank you this type of business could be huge I can help you scale this business from a Global Perspective and I think that's really important for a business like this absolutely you know the global market is definitely something we're interested in I think Peter has a great offer on the table that's why I'll match that but for 20. I'm huge in the wedding industry obviously but I like Cuban's technology idea and he owns that company as a piece of me how about we partner Cuban and I 50 50 off you the 400 000 we'll do it for 25 percent actually what we should do is we should see if Peter wants to come in and go to the 33 but let Peter handle the international Kevin handled the weddings and everything I can deal with the technological side now we'd still need the 33 percent that gives us enough each Peter Peter's in for that I'd love I would love to do that I think that's the guys give me some room here hell no hey why don't we take it up to 40. I'm going to add the diversity no you know how close I am with the music Community come on man let me listen this is gonna be a social media play right African-American we like to talk so why don't you let me in on a little bit give me a little Damon Damon another seven percent all of a sudden yeah can you sing Lori like right now we've got we're going to throw Damon under the bus unless you're willing to let go to 40 percent to give us 10 each then we get everything he's got on social you've got four sharks we love the deal to go to 40 we should put in a little bit more money agree so that it should be 500k at that point done right now look it seems like a lot but effectively we're letting you to stay creative and you guys will own the majority still but you've got four people who touch every base so that makes it a home run we'd like to counter offer um Can can we talk for a second sure if you guys don't mind please no go ahead think about the amount of money that you would have to pay to get four sharks like us you know the expertise that we bring is Extreme in this case [Music] a 700 000 . [Music] so uh I'm just going to counter with this uh but can can we do eight hundred thousand forty percent I think you might be too greedy now I think you've got a good deal at 500 000 for four well forty percent if you give us the 40 we will blow this thing up and your competitors will be in the dust you'll be playing tunes of Woe and misery for them foreign [Applause] thank you [Music] I feel like crying I know it's gonna be big ", "LuLu Bang": "[Applause] i'm dre and i'm kelly and we're sisters from philadelphia pennsylvania you know why it's gonna be really good because you made it because i tell you the truth we've cooked all our lives we love to cook my mom was the best cook ever we would go to church on sundays come home and she would tear the kitchen up so it's very important that we continue the tradition how about this one dinner four years ago i couldn't find the taste that i wanted so i decided to make it myself here you go eat up when we tried it everyone said it was the best thing they had ever tasted everybody enjoying the food from that point we decided to give it a name lulu we named the product after our brother mike whose nickname was lubang he was carjacked and taken away from us tragically and it's our way of keeping his legacy alive having a shark taste our product and validate that it is real good will just make this journey all the more sweeter [Applause] [Music] hi we're the bear sisters andre and my name is kelly and we're from philadelphia pennsylvania we're seeking 150 000 in exchange for 10 equity in our company now sharks let's

ashley amazing our sauce is so amazing you can literally eat it on anything so we prepare four different dishes we have our famous lulu bang wangs we actually have our seafood fried rice our vegetable medley and then we have a fajita style chicken and steak so what we wanted to do was allow you guys an opportunity to chase the sauce and it's it you know just in this pure state uh a person that usually is not really a good question the asian i love you like so what we wanted to really share with you guys is how awesome it is and the fact that you can use it on anything these are your recipes yes every last one one of the great challenges of barbecue sauces and we've had our fair share of them over the years in shark tanks we've tasted great sauce and this is as good as any that's not going to be a problem that's great no one ever brings their sauce in here and says it's not banging yeah right so this is a big good sauce this you've got to tell us what your distribution strategy is to get market share in the sauce business which is brutally competitive oh we would love to share that story we started in catering and restaurants everyone kept telling us the sauce is the bomb i mean it's just amazing and so we started selling it on small scale what happened was the largest retailer in the world walmart did a uh manufacturing summit last year so we pitched our product and we put it to walmart to walmart and what happened many factors at the end of the day we walked away with the regional deal we're in 170 stores yeah you're in 170 walmart stores it is so hard to get into walmart tell us about your walmart journey what's the plan are they going to roll you out to more stores so again we've just started with them in um march right um we've already been connected to the women's initiative the women's economics i've had conversations with my senior buyers um and she actually said and i really don't toot my own horn but when we went and presented she said we were the best that she's ever seen kelly we never asked what does it cost right now we are manufacturing including packaging and all of that for a dollar and ninety cents and what does it sell for it sells for uh 399 retail in the three months since you started how much have you sold we sold a total of in walmart buy itself 45 000 [Music] how many are you selling a week so we sell about 500 a week wow that's low how much are you selling right now online oh yeah we're not selling a lot online you know 170 stores 500 a week is an average of only two and a half bottles uh a week per store that's our challenge you know because we're so brand new i don't think this is gonna work this is never gonna be a big online business i'm sorry it weighs too much and it's a competitive space it's a commodity to differentiate your product this is a massive branding exercise in other words you need a lot more than 150 000 dollars all sharks are still in but they're concerned about the low sales of kelly and gerais sauce company lulubang despite being in numerous locations i don't think this is going to work you need a lot more than 150 000 to break into the big things i'm sorry ladies i'm out thank you for that thank you so much for you you know kevin time out you sell online glass jarred cupcakes yes and they're great they weigh a tenth of this our whole deal is to take the weight out i've lived this nightmare the whole shipping thing is beyond a challenge let me give you my thoughts first of all great the food amazing it is uh the sauce bring a tear to a glass eye right amazing a cheer to a glass eye yeah yeah that's how serious i am and let me tell you what i went through and how i experienced this i i did a deal called bubba baker's boneless ribs and bubba had sauces what we found out it was so hard to sell barbecue sauce online because people can't visually taste it they're very very heavy and a lot of breakage we ended up selling the barbecue sauce because the barbecue sauce was in the ribs a small sample of it people would taste it and then reorder but if we didn't have that lead-in to grab the people to give them the tasting we would have never sold any sauce and i know the issues here and i can't help you with this before you can thank you i find the product packaging a little confusing consumers are very fickle when they walk through that shelf space you know it looks very asian to me right i'm and then i see barbecue sauce and yet you told me it's good for everything right i think you've come a really really long way you've bagged a massive elephant in terms of walmart you've got a great test you know the branding will probably have to change a little bit but it almost feels to me like it's at the beginning amazing job but i just don't think i'm the partner at this point for you i'm out well thank you thank you very much when i look at you reminds me of a saying some women fear the fire some women become it you have become it and you have done an amazing job and you have an amazing partner in walmart for me when i invest in something i like to invest in things that are unique but there are a million barbecue sauces out there and for that reason i'm out thank you guys you deserve a ton of credit my challenge is i need to see a company that's going to do 10 million dollars in sales or 50 million dollars in sales over the next 10 years even five years but we're definitely that company mark i know you want to be i know you want i believe that we are and here's why because we've had conversations with walmart and with shoprite and all of those guys the expansion piece of it we've got that nail you know it will happen it's just not going to happen in the next two or three years even if you get out to a thousand stores selling you know seven a week your business will grow and it'll be a great profitable business for you but that doesn't necessarily mean it's an investable business for me so for those reasons i'm out but again congratulations thank you you guys deserve just a ton of credit good luck ladies guys thank you you know what i do not feel like it was a wasted effort i would do it all again we know that it's going to be the sauce in every single household it's not a matter of if but when the chances of that actually being successful even with the walmart oh no walmart will get behind did you know everything when you started your first business i'm looking at it saying no chance it's a total commodity kevin what you're missing what you're missing i'm not missing anything i noticed children put a dime into it the issue is scale it's not whether or not they'll be profitable because they can sell it they can hire more people to sell it it's just how much my whole point about these dialogues we're having with these people with all this glowing encouragement is you're not giving them the real risk profile of what they're spending their time okay okay kevin let's talk about the truth let's talk about the list pro truth kevin you're an idiot let me tell you on the truth goodness i'm here mark thank goodness so kevin kevin because you think amazing stuff that means the three of them spend the next two years trying to sell a hot sauce listen to me with this kumbaya stuff no i'm not whether or not it's worth the next two years to try and take the story what are we supposed to do say you know give up i would like to see a little because you're never gonna get anywhere how about telling them the truth and what would you have said about my earring organization it's like damn selling t-shirts many people said this is never going to go anywhere you're not going to get at any stores nobody needs this product if i had listened to any of them if i tried to find the hardest i'm gonna go with the barbarians to go into to get market sharing i think it would be the barbecue remember there is no such thing as an easy businesses that are born in hell and this is one of them i would rather work 80 hours a week to make 50k and work for myself than have a 7 500 000 job working for somebody else if you guys loved it so much how come not a dime from any of you it's her business it's her justice kumbaya you keep going stuff but excuses we didn't see excuses i told him the truth i didn't have to give him an excuse shame on you shame on you where's your eject button you ", "Young King Hair Care": "[Applause] first in the tank is a company for an underserved customer [Music] hey sharks my name is Cora and this is my husband Stefan and we're from Atlanta Georgia we're seeking 225 000 for 2.5 equity in our company Hair Care WoW shark did you know that excuse me sharks it sounds like we may be getting a video call in hey sharks I'm the real shark here I'll let my parents handle it I gotta take that I gotta take a car bye well sharks that's our son and chief inspiration officer Kate and as you can see he's the one that really runs the show we actually started this company because of him Kate was born with a head full of hair and we quickly realized that we need to help selling his hair because there was no plant-based natural or clean hair care products that were specifically crafted with young men with textured hair so we created Young King Hair Care the first the first the fast the fastest growing Multicultural brand for young men we currently offer five natural hair care products that promote textured hair health and growth and provide a simple regimen to make it easy for both parents and their sons to care for their hair so sharks if you believe Multicultural boys deserve high quality products really tailored for their needs please join us on the Journey of redefining Mel grooming by focusing on the Next Generation We Are Young Hair Care sharks you'll see that you have samples in front of you for you guys to be able to try out can you tell us a little bit about yourselves absolutely absolutely I was raised by a single mom uh Who provided for me and my sister and instilled the confidence in us to go after our dreams my sister went on to be a physician and I actually worked my way up the corporate ladder and was a VP at one of the largest healthcare companies in the globe when I had my son as you saw he had so much hair and I was looking for products that I felt really reflected him as a young man of color and so it just bothered me that I didn't find anything like that that existed and my husband actually did a little mini shark tank with me and I pitched to him um and he was like yeah you're on to something and I was like I could have told you that duh and Stefan are you in the business I am in the business so my entire career has been within marketing I had worked on some of the most iconic brands that you guys know so working at General Mills working on Nature Valley and Fiber One in Progreso working at Coca-Cola where I ran Sprite for North America wow do you have any competition so we have uh competition in terms of there being other textured Kids Hair Care Brands there are not a lot of products out there that focus on plant-based natural clean ingredients but they are unfocused on boys correct at all Damon when you were a little demon it's just a little baby we both had hair what did you use for your hair you know back then there was either Supernatural or you generally just didn't care we didn't have a lot of information back then right when we walked down an aisle and I haven't been down that hair care aisle in a long time and I walked back down it hadn't changed in 15 and 20 years there was nothing else there was nothing but pinks and oranges there wasn't anything that spoke to our son and spoke to boys I'm dying to ask 225 000 for two and a half percent you gotta have big sales you guys like sales so let's talk about forty one hundred dollars that's it in our first year of sales okay so and that was 2019. okay so then obviously we know a little thing called cobit kind of impacted the business so we finished a year in uh 2020 at 362 000. that is growth so far in 2021 we've been okay um we have okay okay um 1.54 million dollars yesterday what are you making any money are we making any money now we are not profitable yet oh the path to that what's your average selling price across the line and what your average cost of good across the line our costs come in at about 235 to 350 depending on the skew for wholesale we actually sell that between six and six fifty to them and then on DTC we sell um up to 14. so where did the money go obviously as a new brand we had to drive brand awareness right so about 70 percent of our expenses go towards marketing wow that's the problem yeah that's really hot but we had to introduce a new brand to an audience that didn't know about us how much money or how much did you raise or borrow and how much of the company do you own so we raised 1.6 million hello he weighs 1.6 million no I know why you bald let's go on a convertible note that closed in March and that was our seed round listen I think you are right on the right Trend I definitely think you should put these gorgeous young men your son's faces on here because my biggest marketing thing is you should look at a quick glance and know what something is like that but I feel this is a super competitive space so I have concerned for you in really growing it to be something enormous it's just not the right investment for me at this time I'm out thank you thank you I see the need for the product you got investors you have a responsibility I understand asking for 2.5 but I can't get behind that for 2.5 uh okay huh what can you get behind one shark is out Damon likes Cora and Stefan's Hair Care brand marketed to boys with textured hair young king but he's concerned about the high valuation and small stake they came in offering it's not about what I owed one in one of these situations because a lot of things that we take in in consideration you offer me 2.5 I can't it's an insult to go to 15 and 20 and all that kind of stuff it's just not right but what would you feel good yeah I would say I'm out of respect all right you know it's obvious you came from a big company because you market like a big company and that's tough when you step into an entrepreneurial environment branding as a small entrepreneurial company is a completely different effort and I'm not sure that you're going to be able to accomplish that and I'm not sure that you know I'm a lean and mean work your way through type guy so I don't know if we'd be a fit so for those Reasons I'm out okay like I tell you amazing product I believe in you I believe in the future I just don't understand the narrow Niche aspect of it like what I was hoping was you're going to build a representative brand to take on all those products so we are so we have to start somewhere yes exactly our goal is to create Holistic Solutions from very early and baby all the way up until their time challenge you have a lot of we're growing we've got skin care that's actually launching I wish you had all that but at you know to Damen sport what a two and a half percent what am I going to ask for 3.1 and we're negotiate a 2.7 2.9 I I I can't get there at the two and a half percent I wish you all the best I mean honestly two of the most impressive people I've ever seen on on that carpet yeah congratulations thank you thank you so it I'll tell you guys and I know one of the things that's important and one of the things that we teach our son Kate right is the word can't right can't have not your vocabulary and I understand and I understand where you guys come from we came here not to just be here right but to find and leverage your expertise to really help us grow is there any flexibility where you know we're open to if it's a line of credit um is there any debt vehicles that people might want to be interested in because we'd love to partner because again we're still growing for the future and we have a lot of the word royalty actually no I don't think you said it yeah I thought I heard royalty yeah I don't think I don't think he said royalty at all actually know where that came from it says young king a king is royalty that's what it is [Laughter] you know what I like about this it has sales yeah a lot of those things and when when there's sales sometimes my hair starts to grow back because because it can support a royalty my favorite structure as you know you have the margins I would give you the 225 thousand for a dollar a skew until I get back to 225 and then it drops to 50 cents in perpetuity Kevin that's what I'm saying is this is forever so when Kay has kids correct kids I don't have any Equity so why would I do it any other way Kate is acting like he's gonna be working for Mr Wonderful I'm the only shark that believes in you guys all right I know you're not going to do that deal I'll give you an offer okay I think royalties are tough because someone's going to buy you yeah but I'll do it for 50 cents until I get a 2X return on the money I give you so I'm going to give you 225 000 when you pay me back 450 the royalty stops I want a five percent equity that converts if the company gets sold so I help you now and if you grow I convert to five you know what that's going to be much more expensive than my royalty if you sell this business one day it's much more expensive yourself way more to him you know what if you sell the business for 500 million dollars you don't care I like that deal that's a huge mistake this is the balance between royalties it's a great lesson go ahead you know Stefan I can't read lips yeah so you don't have to do we're going back I appreciate I think first and foremost like both Mr Wonderful and Robert like I appreciate y'all our issue is cash flow and because of we're spending so much in other places so royalty is a little difficult for us for both of you guys so respectfully I don't think that we're going to be able to take a royalty for you way to stick your shirts congratulations guys all right thank you we built this from the beginning from just uh I mean we built it for our son Kate and I think that's the thing that we think about we're doing everything for him um so you know we'll we'll be back hopefully we'll be back and then you know we'll uh you'll see and hear young king foreign what you did there was sneak in a five percent of the exit price oh no which may ultimately cost them way more than 50. sucking so much cash I can't believe the savagery the greed you expose them to I can't believe it ", "Pinole Blue": "[Applause] next in the tank is a food company based around an ancient grain [Music] hi sharks I'm Eddie I'm Kate I'm Kyle we're here today seeking 300 000 for 10 of our business cannoli blue in Chihuahua Mexico there's an indigenous Community called the Taro maras who run up to 100 miles in a single day up in the mountains with these sandals made out of tires so how do they have the endurance to do that they consume this superfood called Pinole it is a roasted and ground corn mixture that's been used to fuel this tribe of incredible long-distance Runners growing up I wondered why this amazing superfood didn't exist here so I decided to bring back this ancient Mesoamerican tradition to the United States myself while donating back directly to the taromada community Pinole blue is a line of products made from a hundred percent USDA organic heirloom blue corn sourced from Mexico and stone ground with an ancient method using volcanic rock this blue corn is Rich and antioxidants complex carbs and has more protein than other corn varieties and we use it in our drink mix cookies and even our stone ground tortilla that would make your mouth water so sharks who's ready to get on the grind with Pinole blue okay well it smells great in front of us tell us what we have here yeah we have prepared some sample for you azulita cookie and indoor bite tastes just like a peanut butter no bake cookie and a tole latte tacos with our blue green and pink tortillas this is very good you look like a very unusual how did you find each other how did you get together so could it be a little of my story we know that just has a certain place in my heart because it brings back a lot of memories of my parents because they migrated this country with nothing to come to a small town not knowing the language the obstacles and my dad he works in road construction to this day my mom was a housekeeper and the fact that their son is here today is huge after graduating high school I went to college to Wichita on a full ride scholarship and I had a class with Professor Kate she is actually our business professor I told her I have this Pinole idea and she looked at me Square in the eye and said Eddie that's a brilliant idea you should start it next thing you know that holiday break I drove to the Border myself met my cousin and I brought back a thousand pounds of corn in the back of my pickup truck you're nuts amazing yeah she introduces me to Kyle she's like hey Kyle's an engineer but he has a wonderful background in social media and Kyle was another student of Kate yes we both graduated we took this on full time and we started the tortilla factory about a year later how much of this stuff do you sell our lifetime sales so far are 720 000 wow what are you projecting this year are you predicting growth for the business we're projecting 730 000 this year are you guys making money the boroughs last year is 260 and our net is a little bit over 5000 last year so the biggest challenge I see right now it's very specific to a certain market right I don't know what that word means until you just explained it how are you going to educate people how are you going to Market it so that you get new customers that might not otherwise know the story yes our main customer segment is Hispanic populations however we are using the tortilla as a Gateway product to bring people in who is not familiar with you know like you know like and a cookie tell me how many other companies make tortillas yes there is a lot of tortilla company I have noticed that when I go to a grocery store that's correct but I have a question how many stone ground tortillas that are blue corn like this but you know what I have never been in a circumstance where someone said is that a stone ground tortilla yeah you know just because you're the only stone ground tortilla doesn't mean people care look guys what you've done is great but to get me excited I have to be able to visualize it going to be 7.5 or not even 75 million in sales and you guys haven't given me an idea of a path that you'll take because you do have challenges to get there so for those Reasons I'm out [Music] I wanted to say that I think it's nothing short of a miracle that you found each other that's pretty remarkable it almost seemed like a family but I think it's a little too early for me to have the confidence of the traction that I think it would make enough money to have an investment in so for that reason or not you know guys I love your stories you know it was so amazing to hear that you know I was raised by a single mum in East London I'm one of four sisters I know what it means for parents to sacrifice everything I think for me this is just a really hard thing to invest in at this point in time it isn't for me right now so for that reason I'm out thank you thank you so product tasted great I like that it does more than you know traditional corn tortillas but while I think it's a great business for you it's just so early I don't know about this as an investment for me so I'm sorry I love you I respect these sales 700 000 sales that's proof of concept for sure I'm gonna buy it I mean I'm just gonna go online and put it in my fridge because it's better than the stuff I'm eating right now but I had to listen to you for a long time to understand that and that's where the challenge lies for me as an investor I think it's pretty hard to tell that story without a tremendous amount of work but I don't want to discourage you I mean anybody that gets past half a million I found something the reason we are not able to scale the way that you are talking about is because that's why we are here we are we are at the point that the rocket is ready the classic chicken and tortilla problem too early it's got to have more tortilla on the bone I'm out good luck guys congratulations you know before before you let us go Professor Confessor Kate's only an hour show I I understand but at the end of the day you need to let the professor have a few more minutes like my students say we want to leave the classroom I say come on we are not done just a little bit longer well it took us a while to get the sales up and going was because you know we were trying to figure out everything and then we also had a setback in 2018 um with Kate's husband he had a sudden death and that kind of hit us hard um that was saying for me and my daughter we choose to go to hospice and they come to visit him and after they leave this is what he said to me you have to help his two kids because they are Scrappy because they no money and that's why you know and so sir you have helped them you're here on Shark Tank sales will grow it's just it's early it's too early I'm sorry but we drove here from Kansas we started three years ago with nothing Eddie had this hand crank and and started with just this hand cricking it out of the dorm room like Scrappy is what we do we've had anybody were you Scrappy when you got started oh Scrappy's did you have a lot going for you right did you have a lot going for you no a lot Lori Scrappy you will keep grinding this out it's really important to know you're young like you're just starting this is not the end-all be-all this is the beginning good luck thank you very much you know thank you thank you for this opportunity you have but I just wish that uh you know okay yes we wish we could stay and talk forever we can you guys got to go thank you guys thank you thank you guys thank you guys thank you thank you keep your chin up I think the sharks made a huge mistake and we've made it clear that we've been able to do something really great out of nothing it's part of our pitch the grind never stops ", "Enso Rings": "next into the tank is a safer version of something we wear every day [Music] hi i'm brighton jones and i'm aaron dally we're from salt lake city utah and we're the founders of enso rings we're seeking five hundred thousand dollars in exchange for seven and a half percent of our product that's disrupting the jewelry industry sharks do you know what this is if you're thinking wedding ring you're wrong it's an fad a finger amputation device it might sound crazy but it's true whether you're at the gym on the job or simply unloading your car at any moment your ring could catch on something and severely damage your finger or even rip it right off it's called ring evulsion and it happens to over 150 000 people per year enso rings are made of a proprietary silicone that's engineered to take a beating and adapt your active lifestyle and most importantly they're designed to break away when caught on something in short enso rings are the most stylish safe alternative to metal rings and wedding vans sharks this is a standard metal band just like the ones you're wearing right now and this is award-winning professional bodybuilder garrett coelho that my dear is a man barbara stay in your seat his biceps represent over 500 pounds of pulling force which is more than enough to tear your finger right off garrett what do you say we show them what happens when their ring gets caught on something oh wow oh my god now let's try that again with the real finger on a human hand and an enso ring and let's up the stakes this time and triple the pulling power luke darnell come on oh god now what about this lori and please whatever you do do not try this at home all right you guys ready in three two one pull oh yes and that's the power of an enzo ring so it just broke it just came apart thank you guys i appreciate it now i don't believe it let's do it again we probably need to dismiss these guys so you'll stop staring at their biceps and listen to the rest of our presentation so thank you gentlemen thank you all right sharks we brought samples for each of you robert here we go so what you're looking at is a specially curated selection of our rings you have different options thank you the ones on your right appreciate our loose rings that we took a guess at your sizes so you can try those on most people tell us that 30 seconds after they they put it on they forget that it's even there they're all plastic they're made of silicone a silicone rubber okay so in america how many people do you think get up in the morning and say wow i hope my finger doesn't get ripped off when i catch my ring in a rope pulled by a guy from mount zeus zero but that's a problem that is a big problem when you need it how do you get anybody even interested in understanding why they need an enzo ring 150 000 people in the u.s alone per year have a ring of old genetics that's your opening marketing but how many of those people get their fingers ripped off versus pulled strained you guys might have seen jimmy fallon's it took him off the the air for two weeks he was walking in his kitchen tripped on the rug ring gets caught on the counter top and nearly tears the finger off wow if you have an active lifestyle you're constantly taking your ring off putting it on and we haven't talked about all the applications these are really popular among nurses they match their scrubs we're talking about firefighters electricians physicians the military they can't wear metal rings tell us about you how you came to do this sure brian and i we've been friends pretty much our whole lives and we've always wanted to start a business together a few years ago i had a rock climbing accident i fell and on the way down my wedding ring got caught on the rock and there was that split why would you even wear a wedding ring while you're climbing it's not something you think about you don't wake up in the morning i always take my ring up i'm working out playing basketball not everybody does though some people just forget about it don't think about it what do you actually sell one ring for anywhere from 11.99 to 39.99 and what does it cost you to make it it ranges from 70 cents up to four dollars wow i'm gonna guess you guys have a ton of sales actually in the past 18 months we've done 3.8 million in sales whoa unbelievable i knew it this year we're projected to do a little over 5 million what so on the 1199 ring this one i guess it costs you 70 cents correct i love this and you sell this one for man which is the largest for how much 39.99 30. how much is that cost that one cost anywhere from two to four dollars why would that cost four dollars we wanted to get a band that looked like a metal ring everything out there we thought looked cheap we use actual gold in the gold ring so it gives you it has elements of flecks of gold in it it does wow i respect sales doesn't matter what i think it matters what the market thinks and i'm very impressed where are you selling them it's all through the dot com and marketplaces right it's all online it's uh been an amazing social media push your real expense is customer acquisition because you're selling online right and it's a fear sale so you're scaring the hell out of people to cause them to buy something so this last month what were your sales what did you spend on marketing yeah last month best month ever 460 000 in sales last month okay we spend about 40 on average you guys will spend 2 million plus in advertising and marketing sure you guys are a marketing company that just found a product that's not a bad thing you're obviously good at it but i i just scaring the hell out of people that their finger might get yanked off i just don't see that as a long-term business so for those reasons i'm out this fear this fear-based aspect is what we started with because that's what we understood but our largest market right now it's about it being a jewelry trend here's here's the thing i'm familiar with silicone because i make a lot of products in silicone there's just tons of these out there so i'm not taking away that you don't have great sales because you do have great sales but as an investor when i look at something i look at what's out there and then i think about what's going to be the likelihood of making my return on my investment while you might be great and your sales are great i think it's a little dicey because there's so much competition our model for those reasons oh i'm sorry okay thanks thanks laurie i find your messaging is mixed up i'm not sure it's a message save your finger or this is a fashion statement and trying to relay both of those and even in your packaging i don't see that messaging so i don't find that clarity that's going to hook in the customer that you want so with your great presentation skills i say think of your next business as fast as you can i like to think probably arrogantly that i understand a little bit about every business there's been a couple of times nine seasons people have come out and i'm sitting here and i'm going i have no clue why people are buying this that was tipsy elves and it was sand cloud tip sales was 72 million dollars this year wow what i learned in investing in those guys is there was a message behind their product even they didn't understand at the time so sometimes your consumers tell you and create the message barb is that on your message is very confusing but five million dollars for the customers can't be wrong so i'll make you an offer you're kidding robert you're really losing these guys are great i love these guys i'll give you the 500 000 for 20 it's it's a pure flyer for me it offers 500k i offer twenty percent thank you kevin i can speak for okay because i too have five hundred thousand i i two have an offer kevin i can't speak i find you exceedingly greedy let me give you an alternative when you walked in here you pitched us on this six plus million valuation i was going to give you the finger but now i'm wearing your ring and i'm feeling the love i really like it to me the opportunity here is to leverage that platform we call the something wonderful platform to reduce customer acquisition costs and i've got millions of customers i'm going to give you the 500 000 as a loan and because you can afford it you're gonna pay me two dollars per order until i make back 1.5 million then it goes away and i want five percent equity to be your banker and the person that provides you help in customer acquisition i would consider a counter okay thank you very much so you see something in it there's something here for sure i'd feel a lot better if one of you knew what the something was i'm okay with that i mean if if you're going to stand there and say we're only rings there's no business no no i like that thank you would you be willing to do 10 percent uh no well but let's talk about the evaluation i guess where are we coming up short with the numbers we gave you are you kidding the risk is huge it's just a risk comfort thing but here's what i will do i'll split the difference between 10 and 20 i'll do it at 15. you guys should grab that money and run like maybe you guys are crazy to take that if you believe what you said you're crazy to take 12 and a half nah i've been sticking 15. okay the last thing would be do you guys have interest in something together because the wedding platform is big for us not just the engagement side but then also do you understand it for like are you thinking through my offer it costs you a lot less if you're actually going to be successful because it goes away after basically 30 months i've already done the math i don't want to play with kevin okay i think access to the platform's worth something but also if you really think through my offer it costs you a lot less if you believe you're going to be successful you guys are going to figure it out 500 000 15 maybe they're smart guys they're smart guys no doubt they're definitely smart guys kevin thank you very much for the offer we're going to go ahead and take roberts yes yes congratulations thank you thank you that was awesome i don't understand it but i'm so excited i'll explain it to you along the way thank you thank you appreciate it very much [Music] it's possible kevin's would have worked out better financially and so is it for us for good and robert's someone who gets that it's incredible you can see it in his eyes from the beginning he was into it and we love that kind of passion you ", "ZUUM": "next up is a business capitalizing on the personal electric vehicle Trend there you go okay that's [Music] cool hey shks my name is Chico and my name is Mason we're both from Portland Oregon and our company is zoom Technologies we're here seeking a $125,000 investment in exchange for 20% of our company the trend towards electric rideables has been taken the US by storm from electric scooters popping up all over cities overnight to everyone and their mother wanting a hoverboard consumers are fascinated with the idea of electric rideables and are eager to hop on to the trend that's where we got the idea to start our company and introduce Zoom shoes to the market Zoom shoes are individual self-balancing platforms for your feet that go up to a top speed of 8 miles per hour with an average ride time of 1 hour Mason why don't we show the Sharks how they work let's do it with zoom shoes there are a ton of different ways you can ride them you can easily maneuver through as well as over different objects but the best part about Zoom shoes is you can practice your sick dance moves hit it cheeks [Music] [Laughter] wow just like Kevin we're two young entrepreneurs that are dedicated to making electric rideables accessible to the masses so sharks who wants to hop on early and zoom with us towards the future I want to try it remember your children Mark you want to try no all right make sure you get on and yeah you basically just lean forward to go forward oh my God backwards to go backwards do you feel like you're going to fall off come on Lor e [Laughter] me come on baby bye Robert I lock the doors oh he's got it down that whole stop wait wait wait could he stop himself or no just like a hoverboard getting on is not hard it's getting off that's hard exactly it's a little harder to stop but what if you're in a city right there's potholes there's like divots in the street sidewalks are always like this so what happens then right so we don't really see it as an alternative to Walking In The City the cool thing about the zoom shoes is you can throw them in your backpack what is the price $2.99 $2.99 what do they cost landed 130 so who created this so the manufacturer designs it and we introduced it into the us and we met with the manufacturer over in China we flew over to them okay so you're a distributor already made product what stops me Mr Wonderful from going to the same manufacturer and bringing this zoom out as the wonderboard what stops me from doing that nothing but what we have is we have our company we have zoom and we in January of this year we launched a Kickstarter campaign for these and we raised $25,000 just to get manufacturing done well we raised the money to test the market because we really see Kickstarter as a good way to see is there a proof of concept do you have exclusive rights on the contract tell me the deal that you made to bring the product we don't have exclusive rights on the technology what relax Kevin this self-balancing technology is available I I get that for sale but what do you have that's the reason why we're here we want to take that money um that we're asking for to create custom design oh that's a bad idea guys look one of the key things for any entrepreneur is to know what business you're in if you would come in and said here's who we are we realize other people can come in and sell the same product but here's why we are the best sales organization you guys didn't come in and say that though you didn't tell us that's where your expertise was and for those Reasons I'm out what's your biggest obstacle um I think it would just be I don't know what what do you think CH the capital intensive and having the con connection of like a shark you're not persuasive at all if you were to ask me what the obstacle was with every single business I've invested in this moment I can tell you exactly what they're confronting and they know it okay so our biggest obstacle with this is capital we just we have opportunities we just can't fulfill those opportunities because we don't have the money for inventory it is you there I never seen a business a young entrepreneur inexperienced entrepreneur whose problem was solved by money period the thing that solves every problem is passion and I've seen people make huge successes without a dime in their pocket if they have the passion and we will we will if we don't have the capital we'll just grow slower take one passion you're not going to grow and for simply that reason I'm out I have a question what's your competition does segue have one yes they came out with a pair as well they're more expensive and they have that brand recognition that's why they sell for hire that's everything that brand name is really hard to go up against when you're small so my confusion here is I understand you're repping products that's fine I'm not sure why you picked this that can have so much trouble down your road I feel because you have all those issues it's not a wise investment for me today so I'm sorry I'm out guys let's take stock where we're at you do not own anything in a very competitive market I don't want to discourage you but maybe I do I actually think this sucks um I hate it I'm out thank you thanks Kevin I I'm just trying to go back what the game plan is cuz I'm a little unclear you don't make the product you have no exclusivity there's nothing proprietary about your product what's the vision so for the vision we know some manufacturers in China that we want to innovate on top of the current electric scooter Market we want to create more of a catalog of electric ridable markets Robert what are you going to dot I'll do this for you I'm now Robert I'm out see you later look I I wish you all the best but I don't trust you with my money I just don't trust you're going to be a custodian of my money and make more of it with this business I'm out okay guys listen hire a great salesperson no go out and sell yourself it's your product figure it out cannot Outsource sales when you're starting Lori let them go and steepen their misery good luck guys thank [Music] you wish we could have came out there with more energy going to take what they said and you know really try to sell our product and really Market it and just continue what we're doing cuz we're we're on the right [Music] path next into the tank is an innovation for a common household tool [Music] hello sharks my name is Evan Dobson founder of wisp Industries and I want to introduce you to the Wisp a revolutionary floor cleaning system that's in the process of disrupting a category that hasn't changed in centuries sweeping we have literally re-engineered the broom and the dustpan from the bristles up making for a more efficient and unique action we call whs be we all know what it's like to use an old broom and a dust pan at requires two hands in a side by side motion to use the pan you got to bend down it's true it's a pain putting strain on your back and your knees and we all know what it takes to get that last pesky line of debris well no more the Wisp is intentionally lightweight to be used with one hand in a pulling motion the bristles are short dense and 90\u00b0 to the floor to create a perfect seal to that surface the patented whsp pan is amazing it literally allows you to apply pressure with your foot simply step on the back here and see how that creates that perfect seal allowing you to easily bring in that debris effortlessly that's smart on the side of the pan are Combs that allow you to clean that bristle wow the evolution of sweeping is wisping that's why we're seeking $500,000 for 10% of the company so come on sharks a lot of wh who wants to join team whisp right now and make sweeping changes all across the world have you sold any of these things yes we sold over 100,000 units today we've done over 3.3 million in sales lifetime wow is any of this protected or all of it everything you look at has a design patent and utility p as well so what was your profit last year did not have a profit last year we had a loss due to two very significant events where it Aid into our margin we were on a couple of shows where we had to do Revenue share there was an inherent marketing cost to reach that many eyeballs so you offer your product at half price it's 50% off to the customer so basically if you have a 50% markup on your product you make no money but you get a lot of eyes on your product we sold 20,000 units in 4 hours but at no profit very little but what about the rest of the year what was your sales last year 1.43 and you made no money on that we lost 600,000 go how' you do that that's hard to do there was a lot of decisions that I made and I take full responsibility for it I had many people that were on um a consistent kind of compensation schedules and I learned that that was when times were lean that that was a bad decision on my and I've made those changes like sales reps and distributor type things yeah and people that market e how much have you invested and how much have you raised I've raised uh close to $2.5 million over six years the C golf been doing this six years wow so we don't even know what does one cost and what does it cost to make the configuration you're looking at right here cost $29.95 and our cost of goods in 17 were $8.50 so the problem is you're competing with an $8.99 broom yes and how much you have in inventory there we have about $300,000 why did you buy so much inventory in 2016 we went viral to over 110 million views and we sold out like that so instantaneously I went we need more inventory we brought it in caught up because it took time all of our search and exposure started dissipating and we had to start that back up again so we did another event and we keep doing this roller coaster what we're looking at with your help would be to bring in a more consistent economical way to create a supply chain and then really go after what we believe as our online Edge okay so what are your cumulative losses since the beginning of inception like what how much have you lost in these years total he raised 2.5 does that mean you've lost 2.5 you have any money left we have about $50,000 okay so you have $50,000 in the bank $300,000 in inventory some IP but effectively you're down $2 million more 2.1 million in the hole [Music] all sharks are still in but they've discovered that eban is over $2 million in debt for his broom business wisp effectively you're down $2 million more 2.1 million in the whole well I don't believe I'm doing a really good job of painting the exact picture because um we we know that the products will set and what I'm here for is to is to I've made mistakes and I think you get a a for effort and a f for execution and I think you know that and so for those Reasons I'm out look the product clearly works I mean that's the Intriguing part but in year after year after year you've made no money that's very depressing and so the question is do you need adult supervision so that you get focused on one thing cuz there must be somebody that wants a broom that works it's just how do you find them it's why I'm here it's why I'm here because I've been punched for three plus years and and um I've been working off instinct to go uh and optimize U cost of goods but where did you raise a 2.5 million from well from U my network uh and nobody has come in since then saying what the hell's going on well um let me take over let me give you some I never raised enough money to really drive the business I always did it Project based and it's it's been a long time coming we did a 2.5 million each one of us started 100 million plus businesses with thousands of dollars look we all make mistakes as entrepreneurs but I just really don't think you have your act together on this for those Reasons I'm out okay sorry about that Ean I have this Theory when you're first starting a business make it sell it make it sell it I feel like You' spend a lot more money maybe than you needed to and I would take a hard look at that one of the things that I say to people is as soon as you can afford to hire your weaknesses your contribution to this feels like it should be more in the product side and I would encourage you to get support on the Marketing sales side so that you can really focus on the part of the business that I can feel is your strength okay and I like your product I'm going to buy your product actually but I'm not going to invest in your company today so I'm out thank Innovation requires education Ean it's a great product it needs to be demonstrated it's been a very Rocky Road you certainly need a partner to be your mirror image and do all the things you don't do well you have some weaknesses in executional skills when it comes to business not everybody does it well that's why they partner mhm you desperately need a partner someone with executional skills and certain disciplines about how money is spent that person's Mr Wonderful so if you want $500,000 I'll do it but I want 50% not 51 50 cuz that's a lot of money I don't like losing $500,000 I don't do that ever do you have debt on the company too very little comparatively how much 250,000 oh KN those this story gets longer well I I don't I don't know if you can sell me 50% of the company who owns it well I have a I have a 22 investors wow that have been through 22 Yeah it's been a long road of oh I feel like I'm at a weake honestly I don't think I've ever sat here where I felt like something really took my breath away oh my goodness I mean I just was like wo it's like a punch to the gut you have so much debt and you've lost so much money what are you going to do how do you recommend I get out of this and fight for it I mean there's got to be a chance you need somebody who who's just a killer salesperson you know I I've had every opportunity to quit from all of the things that we're talking about but I believe in it so strongly and I'm so passionate I own a basketball team and I'm smart enough not to put myself on the court I can't wrap my arms around so much debt it's so bad if you can get Kevin to invest all the money I will help him and you to sell it you put up the money I'll do the Sal you want to put up 250,000 no you put up the I can call you later after I my sleeves and I'll do the Sal that's something we can deal with later look Evan I'll put up the $500,000 but one way or another I'm ending up as a 50/50 partner now if your 22 investors don't like that outcome they don't like it because they're not here but you are so I'm going to make you that offer if you're willing to accept it let's go to work there's not interested in doing anything to bring me in to help you sell it I can discuss that later she's out okay look maybe we'll work with Lori later but right now you need $500,000 she's not willing to put up a scent I am I'll put up the $500,000 but I got to end up with 50% yes or no Evan what do you want to do but why wouldn't you not want to include I might but she's not putting up any money right now so I'm not worried about it I think you need me Evan if you want to do a deal with Lori do deal with Lori she has no money for this deal what do you want to do this is your moment yes or no okay we'll do it wow here you go wow but but but what did I hear a butt but wait there's more I'll lose her number remember he did not include me so now you% I know her number I can call her anytime I want her if I need her and she'll come running maybe maybe not well do you have anything that we could you could add I really I'm out get out of there I'm gone I'm an investor okay I had the 500 it was in your hand and you're talking to her you're out of here see you buddy goodbye take the bye Evan Kevin's offer was amazing but I don't believe that I had the ability to make that decision that quickly that could have gone better but the truth of the matter is is that I'm not going anywhere the Wisp is still going to be available now he's made three mistakes to the next potential that was too tough I'm are you out of your mind that was too tough for that man I'm going up there to shake his hand and he's still talking you know why he to me you terrible no he's not a businessman wait let me [Music] cry next into the tank is a platform to help you explore your [Music] passions I'm calling H I'm calling every single one of you out I'm calling myself out all this talk about dreams and drive and Destiny countless conversations about what we love inspirational quotes and motivational mantras we're all Tau and I've had enough hello sharks my name is Cash Shake I'm the founder of be somebody and we're seeking $1 million for 10% of our company we built the world's first experienced marketplace with a vision to Pioneer experiential learning on our platform you can learn anything that you're passionate about by booking experiences with talented people around you you book them online then you meet up in person for a Hands-On learning experience and the host of our experiences who we call passion Aries get to make money doing what they love so Robert if you want to add ninja skills to your already sexy repertoire of scuba diving and car racing you could book an experience with Ninja Warrior Travis Brewer who [Music] cool oh wow [Music] yeah and D Mev ladies if you guys want to ignite your dormant passion for dance which I know y'all have you could book a group experience and you can learn anything

Olympic gold medalist Christine Lily wow what's up Christine how how are you hello sharks I'm here today as to be somebody passionary and someone who truly loves this company in everything it stands for and they will host all our soccer experiences exclusively on their platform sharks we really believe we have the right Mission the right movement and the right model and we would love for all of you to join us on this world changing Journey thank you so much to our amazing passion Aries and be somebody thanks thank you guys great tell us a little bit about your background so back in 2009 I was seven years into my uh role at Proctor and Gamble the largest consumer Products Company in the world I was leading social marketing for a lot of our bigger Brands like tide and Old Spice and I just turned 30 I was going through a breakup and I was trying to figure out what my purpose was in life and that's when I first started to realize as soon as you start to focus your mind and your heart and your spirit and your soul on your passions the universe starts to open up doors and unlock Windows you never thought possible and the p and I started to learn the power of this word because it's intuitive and instantly personal to people when people around the world here be somebody it becomes about you and about what you love it becomes about your personal passion whether it's photography or car racing or fashion that's what's powerful about it and as soon as I started to really see that there was something there I got a chance to lead PNG and go lead social marketing at GoPro but working for somebody you know well next you're doing a lot of talking and you're not getting anywhere right now right what's the end product what am I let me show you guys so we built an IOS app this is my profile you see all your profiles right here this is my profile page if you hit that little plus it opens up all my passions you can add as many as you want you can create them and then our algorithm takes everything you're passionate about then shows you experiences around you in your local area it's an experienced Marketplace think about Airbnb when you're booking houses here you can book an experience and then you can book individual training great question we take 20% of every experience that's booked on our platform on average $40 in experience you have to aggregate a whole bunch of passion Aries by the way I love your name cash thank you but unfort I've learned that happiness can't buy money so I've got to understand how fast you can scale this thing so I can make cash right so what we have we have a global movement that reaches 5 million people that means five million people a month are either dropping this be somebody hashtag if you guys search it right now like get on get on your phone search but is that of your company or just in general be somebody I tra I was the first person in history trade you just put hashtag and B it'll pop up and someone could still click on it so it doesn't mean necessarily we own every asset with be somebody that's fine it's kind of like GoPro like we we branded the the fisheye we're trying to see what connects to revenue I'm a little confused what the platform is is the idea we just get together and do an activity we like like whitewater rafting or is it a training platform where I go to an expert whitewater rafting person great question I wanted to get back to the scale question I think that's important the number one way we found a scale is through strategic Partnerships you guys just heard from Christine Lily how you protect yourself against Barbara and I we go white water rafting a big Jagged Rock comes up somebody pushes off the boat cracks her head to the white meat before her husband gets a brand new sexy wife she sues somebody how do you protect yourself against law suits like that right now we haven't had that problem we know we're going have to figure out that I think that's the reason we're raising Capital you know because we need lose it in a Los to insure yourself or you have a disclaimer what Happ so wa how long have you been offering experience 12 months in Austin Texas so 12 months just as a beta you said so are you open to everybody yet yeah at the end of 2015 we decided we're going to our focus is SC so the first 6 months of 2016 we've been closing Partnerships 80,000 how many how many um experiences did you book last month probably about $2,000 okay so again weilding a global your answer your answer to the potential litigation was you're raising capital is that to get a big insurance policy I mean how every every passionary that hosts a fitness or outdoor experience has to have liability insurance on their own it's part of our terms with the Strategic Partnerships when we scale the reason why they're partnering with us they three reasons one because they believe in a mission you heard Christine ly two because they have a shared have any traffic why would she give you exclusivity when you have nobody on this because you probably had to qualify the exclusivity to an app or something specific as opposed to all bookings right we know all bookings 100% all 100% of their revenue is dependent on you right listen did you guarantee her any minimums no we didn't we didn't I mean but you got to understand starving she's going to starve she's begging for because running out ofhs up here one second just to finish Focus here A second we become a payment platform and a tool for them but I think the guys what's the most important part about this is people believe in what we stand for I'm going to show you guys one thing real quick so I think I think it's important I used to carry this around back in 2011 a little 8 by1 car that I met myself when I was going around the world to try to inspire people you're killing us did you bring a collection plate [Music] all six sharks are still in but Mark has an issue with cash selling the passion more than the merits of his business be somebody a booking platform for experiences cash rule number one the longer the backstory the worse the deal well let me tell you Ru bus more preaching always equals less money for the investor for those two reasons amount right I find you enormously abrasive you drive me nuts I feel as though you don't have the capacity to listen could you imagine what kind of a partner you would make for me I'm out right cash here's the beauty of a social platform here's the beauty of a movement a movement by nature is viral right you're not getting that growth no it's working it's working you know we don't have passar yet because we haven't we haven't scaled our Marketplace you know my BS and I'm not calling you out on this I'm just saying my my sense for that always goes up I I don't understand the business right I mean I'm out I'm going to jump in so there's so many apps out there it seems to me like this is just not going to be one that's going to make it I'm out cash how much how much do your own money do you have in this $200,000 wow 200,000 pioneering experiential learning no you're not education is a $4.1 trillion industry online learning is going three times as fast preach preach it's important I still never got over how you're going to protect yourself against liabilities I just think you're going to have a lot of people teaching dangerous things and one lawsuit can kill the entire company I'm out let's leave all the passion and all this Kumbaya kumbai leave it aside for a second in the end shark tanks about making money we built a brand Kevin I'm going to put you know what's going to screw you up cash the fact that you're believe in your own nonsense you got to do the work somebody doesn't get done bro you got to do you think I've been doing for for three years no we have we built a community from this he's an instructor we built a passionate Community go online just search be somebody you're going to get inspired by all the stories that you're hear the people that are here they're inspired by the movement to have an opportunity cash silence we're going to own the experience I'm calling you out in eight years of History you're one of the first people to ever have six shots at this okay you struck out on every one zero I'm out see you buddy go be somebody bro dive into the Shark Tank Youtube channel And subscribe now for ", "Gallant": "first in the tank is what the entrepreneur believes is cutting-edge healthcare for your loved ones [Music] my name is aaron hirschhorn from philadelphia pennsylvania and my company is gallant take a look at these little puppies aren't they so cute so i brought one for each shark yay okay damon that's bear hey bear how you doing that's bunny baby all right if this guy pees on me it's over between us i understand it's a risk i'm willing to take that's panda who do i get bear with me for a second if you were to fast forward just ten short years four out of five of these little guys are going to suffer from devastating age-related ailments like arthritis blindness or worse oh who's there oh my god move along move along you ain't touching fred mine doesn't want to go i'm sorry buddy i tried to buy you out but no deal panda wanted a royalty i'm reaper i'm turning into robert [Laughter] our story begins two years ago when i was finally freed from a decade of chronic back pain with stem cell therapy and at the same time i watched our beloved family dog rocky suffer from arthritis so painful she couldn't even walk and i wondered if the same revolutionary science that helped my back could also be used for pets turns out it can so i created gallant stem cell banking and regenerative medicine for pets just as you can bank your children's umbilical cord stem cells at birth you can now save your pets young healthy stem cells during the routine spay or neuter all you do is sign up on our website and we send our kit to your veterinarian and take care of the rest and i'm so excited about gallant not only because stem cells treat multiple disorders from kidney disease to broken bones in research animals they've been shown to extend healthy life by as much as 30 percent imagine that that's years more with your best friend so sharks for five hundred thousand dollars in exchange for two percent of the company you can join our pack of stem cell scientists and bring enduring health and puppy love to millions this is not going to end well well you must have fantastic sales i'm guessing so we have two divisions we have a therapeutics division that's actively developing stem cell medicines and we have a consumer stem cell banking division that launches in three weeks i know how this is going to end tell us your history absolutely so in 2009 my wife and i each lost our jobs and we started dog sitting in our house to make extra money and that turned into an online platform for dog sitting i think airbnb for dogs and we generated over 100 million in sales in under six years 100 we merged with a competitor two years ago and that's now worth 925 what was the name of the company oh my company was called dog vacay and now it's called rover wow what was your background training in college i was a neuroscience major i was a high school science teacher as my first job but this is like next level science i mean what i've done here is i've hired the top minds in the field of veterinary regenerative medicine to make this a reality so we have four key patents that essentially lock competitors out of you multi-billion dollar market what is it cover technique yeah so if i may just back up and explain a little bit about how stem cells work so just the same way a lizard like regrows its tail we have stem cells in every tissue of our body and they're responsible for regenerating now the problem is as you get older your store of stem cells go down dramatically and that's directly related to aging so the idea is you should save these young healthy stem cells so that potentially in later years you can use it as a therapy to avoid expensive surgeries or really to even avoid the onset of disease so what we've done is patented the way to isolate the stem cells from the reproductive tissue that they throw in the trash when you get a spay neuter screw the dogs i'm gonna do this myself i would recommend you do it it changed my life completely changed my life you'd have to be neutered first i don't like that part aaron let's just walk through some of the common sense elements of this i'm in sports right and so if it was just as simple as stem cell injections you just give a shot everything would grow back injuries would never matter correct well it sounds like a great dream to me yeah but my point is if it worked anybody with a decent doctor would be doing it why do you think that's not happening the reality here is also this is about the dogs i absolutely believe there's a huge pet market you know people love trying to take care of their dogs as much as you're right this is not standard of care for humans but there's a whole world that comes where you can actually do research first on animals i'd like to spend a little time on the reason you're here yes your business regardless on the skepticism let's start with the consumer side wonderful how much does it cost me to get the kit our goal is to make this accessible so we charge only 95 a year to store your stem cells so every year i pay you 95 you hit my card every year correct i get the kit for free the kit we send uh to your veterinarian so you don't even have to worry about it the consumer buys it on our website does that make money that's one channel and the vet is a revenue stream for them how much are they making they make about a hundred dollars you instantly lose money on the initial acquisition because you're paying the vet correct how much does it cost you to do the extraction so it costs us including the cost of the kit shipping everything it's about 275 right now including what you pay the vet uh no plus plus if we pay the vet most 375 right now vets don't even want that they just want to kind of do it for free or what does it cost you operate the business your burn rate so we're burning about 400 000 a month right now most of that on r d are there any other investors so we have raised a total of 10 million dollars 10 million fund this business okay i've hired someone who's the last valuation on the round 25 million the same as my house how much money do you anticipate having to raise at the time you're gonna launch your product because you don't have any marketing money available to you yet yeah so we will have to raise money again we'll raise how much we'll raise money again in 2021 probably 25 million your acquisition costs that's what makes me the most anxious here about what you're doing is that for every sale you have you're losing money yeah you know you're gonna sink all sharks are still in but anne is concerned about the business model of aaron's stem cell banking company for pets gallant for every sale you have you're losing money yeah you know you're going to sink because you're not going to have the cash flow to support that well we're we're well capitalized now i have a very good idea you can't sell anything because i think there's a couple things that concern me i mean one thing 23 does we make money on every kit but it makes me really nervous that you're going to lose money on every single kick going out the door and it's going to be a couple year to recapture well it takes a little while let me tell you something if anne's nervous you know what it's like to love a pet i mean how can you not support it listen i'm on the petco board but you'd be such a great partner if ann's nervous i'm out thank you i like a lot of aspects of this business this is an emerging science the research is going to take years to do but the consumer business which is going to be your foundation for research and for therapeutics and all this coming is a money loser it's a money sync and so unless perhaps in the very short term yeah but i mean when we're creating a brand new market give me some kind of hope about how does that 275 go down raise prices raise prices to 3.99 which actually is not potentially a bad idea it's like raise prices here your volume is definitely going to go down but at least you're not hemorrhaging on the computer our perspective is that because it's a brand new market that nobody knows anything about we're doing everything we can to lower those barriers to entry in the beginning to create word of mouth to create virality to get the vet on when 23andme launched we launched a thousand dollars and in some ways there was a benefit of doing that because you get the early adopters you work out some of those kinks you always want to treat those customers then great um but but then take down the price perhaps you're right that at that scale there's a better pricing structure yeah all right aaron because i'm so creative i've been listening to you and my juices are flowing i love the space i'm in the space i know and i am mr wonderful here's two offers you choose between them i'll give you the five hundred thousand dollars i want the two percent plus i want another two percent in options so then i'm basically getting into twelve and a half million because of the value i bring or i'll give you the five hundred thousand dollars i want one percent equity and ten dollars off every kit in perpetuity that gets me so incentivized to sell these kits for you you have no idea think about that while everybody else matters in the background that is that is very creative of course it is i really think that's a clever way of doing it of course it is and you'd be you'd be a great partner i mean you know i'd be a great partner i love it aaron i'll simplify things look i believe in stem cells right i believe in what you're trying to do in terms of the storage i just don't think you've got to figure out so for those reasons amounts all right thank you mark good luck thank you so i think there's a lot of potential in this business thank you i think with lori we could actually really do a lot to get this out direct to consumer initially i believe in the long-term potential but we're looking at you know coming in together at 500 000 for eight percent whoa i really believe in this i know quite a bit about it and i just think that you know down the road a lot of things will be figured out but you're in the beginning i think ann is a great partner so i'm really excited to work with him i'd love to figure out a way to make this work look i've got employees that i've given a lot of equity i've got top scientists who basically took a chance on me i got to protect them too but what i think is important too is is them knowing the benefit of having us on your team because we can give you so much help so what are you going to do aaron you've got you've got to make a decision i know lori ann would you guys do four percent so i'll give you four percent of the business because i see the value that you bring and we're off to the races yeah would you do five we got a deal done great [Music] yeah he going to keep the puppy thank you i'm so shocked you're shocked no that fred didn't pee on me i did not expect ann and lori to team up totally surprising but they're honestly the dream team because anne is a perfect partner lori like nobody knows better how to explain things to consumers in the world this is i mean you can see even fred's happy you ", "Scrub Daddy": "Eerste in die Haaitenk is Aaron\nKrause, Wie glo sy produk sal maak\nalledaagse skoonmaak makliker.

", "Squatty Potty": "next into the tank are mother and son entrepreneurs with a product designed to get things moving hello sharks i'm bobby edwards this is my mother judy and we're here seeking three hundred fifty thousand dollars for a five percent share in our simple product that changes lives simply put we're in the business to help you do your business now there's something that each and every one of you are doing wrong every day of your lives and it's adversely affecting your health oh that business the american toilet you know there's very few people that realize that the toilet and the sitting position that it puts you in place a big part in a lot of the colon issues that we have such as constipation let me show you why anatomically we have a muscle called the pubertalis muscle that wraps around the base of our colon forming a kink and when we're sitting on the toilet this kink only partially relaxes and only when we are in a squat position does this muscle completely relax and allows us to have a complete and full elimination of our waist so we've come up with a perfect solution squatty potty [Music] a simple stool that's been carefully designed that allows the user to squat in a healthy position while still enjoying the comfort and convenience of their western toilet and when not in use it stores neatly away so with our hard work and family spirit and your knowledge and expertise squatty potty will be the goose that lays the golden egg for you guys and us too now who wants to climb on board and help us get america bobby how do you squeeze out a profit you want to hear about squatty potty profits yeah well i want to hear about sales because you value this business at seven million dollars that's a whole lot of poo poo we had been in business three years the first year in business we sold one million dollars in squatty potty come on the year after the year after we did 2.7 million yes i like it and this year alone we just sold two million dollars of spotty potties in the first two quarters so how do you sell them to who they're all available online you know we we have a website and amazon we're not in retail yet holy crap you're so holy crap right there's a crapload of money in squad no seriously you're selling 2.7 million online i think i know why why weren't you just on dr oz i just saw that okay so in the first year we were in business in 2012 we were on dr oz yes that's how we got that one million dollars right and you know what dr oz said about it it works because two thirds of the world right people squat yep is there anything to stop someone else from doing exactly the same thing okay so we have several patents we have a design patent on our echo which is our number one seller we have uh patent pendings on this adjustable squatty so an adjustable stool that raises with toilet height so what do you sell it for and what's it cost you to make let's talk about this one because this is the one that's on market it's 25 bucks and what's it cost you to make 450. wow we make them in the united states great margins but guys look with those margins you got to be pooping cash right what do you need 350 000 for so we have so many opportunities we can't fund them all one of the biggest thing that we want is fda compliance and medical reimbursement coverage for this product and getting this as a medical device and this is where this takes this from a as seen on tv direct response product to a real legitimate medical product do you guys have this as a direct response problem so we do this is the other issue why aren't we in retail because people don't know how to put this in retail why would you want to go into retail when you're you're killing it right now why wouldn't we want to be in every walgreens in cvs that's one of the challenges with getting this into retail is i mean do people first laugh yeah why can't somebody just get a stack of books and lift their legs up i mean squatty potty is designed specifically for the task it's perfectly angled the perfect width it's like cutting a steak with a butter knife right you're gonna get it but it's not gonna be as good we expect seven million dollars in 2014. why but why because all of our sales come at christmas at christmas time this is really really 43 plus what are you gonna make off the seven million what we're expecting to earn a million to one and a half million dollars in sale so why if you have 80 margins why aren't you making more money off of seven million in sales the cost of that you know getting a customer and edu it's educational okay so so what's your cost per customer acquisition well right now how much you're spending on advertising in the last six weeks we've been advertising on howard stern for every dollar we spend we get five to four to five dollars in sales so bobby let's say i buy into your 7 million vision for this year in sales what are you gonna do with my money i'm going to increase production immediately our sales are increasing so rapidly our demand is around the world and we have cash in the bank this is this is we can make a crapload of money here and help people poop we're a good family to work with but we feel like we really do need a shark we want somebody on board that will allow us when we make those phone calls they will get answered bob the only problem with your deal is how insignificant five percent is at least for me looking at it i like the deal okay um i'd give you the 350 000 for 10 yeah so that's you know the problem is on the back end it's gonna be worth so much more look i i think you're about to get a lot of verbal diarrhea from kevin so let let me clear the throne okay um let's get one robert kudos to you in a million years i never would have thought you had those kind of revenues i think it's very very difficult to get people to change their minds about things we're used to going to the toilet a certain way you've got to change that perception i mean you're doing it but i got to go with my gut feel i just my first instinct was i just don't see it i'm out okay i've made you an offer i'm offering you 350 000 for 10 bob do you have a counter for that yeah 700 000 for 10 i wouldn't do that deal bobby okay i wouldn't i really like it but to kevin's point too 5 as he would say is a nothing burger well give us give us an offer yeah i think that this could do really well on qvc and in retail but i think retailers is harder but for me to invest i feel like i would need at least 10 percent to make it worth my time okay but i don't want to give you seven hundred thousand dollars okay what do you want to give him well i feel that the 350 000 for 10 is right how about 10 for 500 000 okay so you so bobby your calendar lori is ten percent that's my 500 000. yeah i don't accept that if you're interested if you really want a shark then you would entertain that seriously well the other issue is the ten percent and the value of that in a year or two years you're talking out of both sides of your mouth okay right so you're talking about wanting to get value for where you see the company going and that's why you think it's worth seven million dollars then you talk about boy if only you had a shark who could get your calls taken who can help you get in retail so you're obviously not valuing that because if you truly did value that you would not say look we're all ready to 7 million you would have a value assigned to that that could take you to 14 or 21 and you wouldn't argue about 5 that's the part that doesn't jive i'm out okay there's something about you that i'm not believing ooh fine no i might try i trust your mom but you're popping and weaving a lot i feel and it's making me more nervous as i listen i'm definitely out bobby gets a little excited he's very trustworthy i'm i'm just coming back and forth i apologize if i seem scattered a shark can't get interested in five percent i'm not doing it for less than ten and never would i [Music] actually we're going to take lori's offer there you go great i think i know it helps a lot of people i do know that yeah i know that this really works that's why congratulations you guys take a look [Music] partnering with lori means that we can get the message out that squatting is healthier and just as people shouldn't be smoking they shouldn't be sitting to poop you ", "NuMilk": "[Music] burst into the tank is a better way to enjoy plant-based milk [Music] hi sharks my name is ari tolwin and i'm joe savino we're from new york and we're seeking one million dollars in exchange for five percent of our business wow you got our attention sharks milk today means something totally different from what the milkman used to deliver to our homes sure some of us still drink cow's milk but most of us have switched to almond milk oat milk or even hemp milk butt sharks that comes at a price most of those milks are hyper processed filled with gums preservatives and fillers galore well sharks that's where we come in move on over cow's milk because making fresh dairy-free milk just became utterly easy introducing new milk we built a custom machine for grocery stores where shoppers can make delicious nutritious pure dairy-free milk at the push of a button we use the best ingredients organic almonds from spain for our almond milks a blend of organic cacao vanilla bean and maple for our chocolate milks and a whole lot more our new milks are homemade without the mess or the fuss we're on a mission to bring plant-based diets and zero-waste lifestyles to the world so sharks i just have one question who wants to milk this deal for all it's worth sharks in front of you are a flight of delicious dairy-free milks for each of you to try but before you do so mark you've mentioned your dairy free come on up and make some fresh milk for yourself sure so you can select almond milk or oat milk i'm gonna go with almond milk cause i've had it so i'll know what it tastes like in comparison great so just press that almond milk button and then start on the bottom so the machine is actually making it fresh it's not a concentrate or anything else in there it's taking pure organic almonds from valencia and making the milk right now that's fast that's cool the almond milk is very good it tastes nothing like the store brand the milk i just made is incredible you can tell it's fresh almonds it's incredible just to understand what's in the machine give us the choices so the first thing about new milk is that we're uh really a food tech company and we built a platform right now we have almond milk and oat milk in there but we could do cashew we could do hemp if that becomes popular we could do sesame it's really limitless so how long does it last and what would be the expiration date on one great question it'll have a seven to ten day shelf life and it has to stay in the fridge i mean i think that's the thousand pound gorilla in the room you know coming to the shark tank you want to think big right right you're asking for a million bucks obviously you need capital to build out and lease these machines to all the locations that's a different kind of business model because they require maintenance they require you know the capital to build them yeah and then you also have to get the space inside the grocery store to give you what looks to me like about 10 square feet barbara you're a real estate mogul you understand the value of square footage i'll tell you exactly what is in midtown manhattan for a street location it's 3 000 a foot in a primary location yep how big is that so it's it's eight square feet the machines average fifty thousand dollars per year per machine and so when you think about it that's revenue in revenue yep and it's unmanned and we pay no rent at all what does a machine cost uh the machines are thirty thousand dollars each they'll come down to fifteen you know guys i think it's a genius idea number one you're reducing grocery stores perishable loss right number two is you're attracting new customers i like that uh that whole concept but were you in this area before in traditional business like tell us a little bit about yourselves yeah so uh i come from the food and beverage world before this i did aviation catering for commercial jets private jets so if you guys flew to new york you've eaten our food then i started my own co-packing uh company doing food and beverages uh after that i left and i started this with ari i'm also a second time entrepreneur in the space i had a brand called happy tree maple water i had national distribution where about 8 000 stores did you ever exit on that water company uh no i shut it down actually after we started this i have a question what would mark pay for that bottle of almond milk that he took away yeah you'd pay two dollars for the for the bottle that's a one-time uh charge and if you brought it back you'd pay 3.99 to refill it okay it's 3.99 for the almond milk two dollars for the bottle how much goes to the grocery store yep so uh the grocery store takes about a third all right so how much have you raised uh we've raised 12 million dollars wow what was the last valuation our last valuation was 40 million pre-money so we've actually negotiated with our investors in advance to give you uh a shark appropriate deal guys is there a bigger picture here this is obviously a big picture yes hit him joe so this is our countertop device and this is the bottle that goes with it wow we took our grocery machine we shrunk it down so it works on your countertop so you can have the best that right there is a necessity for the family i think what is that going to cost the consumer it's gonna be about 85 landed that's your cost what was your plan to sell it to them for then 1.99 can you show us how the small machine works this is actually just a 3d rendering prototype okay guys let's get into the numbers just the basics please top line bottom line top line bottom line last three years yeah so 2018 40 000 of revenue one machine partial a year what you lose spent a lot on r d so we spent about two million dollars in r d in 2018 losses were two mill correct approach 2019 320 top line we ended the year with 10 machines how much you lose and then we spent three million dollars on our so five million total losses so far now we're getting to some critical mass here yeah what happens in the third year so third year is this year uh we would have ended the year in about a six million dollar year but because of coronavirus our launch with kroger some growth with whole foods launch with gelsins and some other regional retailers we're delayed so what do you think losses will be this year this year it's going to be about 2 million dollars as well mostly seven mill in the ground so far in the bank three and a half million you projected six but where do you think you'll land now uh this year we're gonna be like 400k by the end of the year in sales yeah wait wait i'm sorry wait whoa whoa you said you projected 6 million for this year but you feel you're going to end at 400. yeah so we wouldn't we would end it with 100 machines at the end of the year can i get your attention just for a moment please i've been sitting here listening to every word i still don't get it and i'm paying attention like crazy ash i'm sitting here feeling like i'm back in second grade failing again because i don't know what the hell the teacher is talking about yet again you talk so much that i can't grab a single word i'm sure you've got something good there i don't know what the heck it is but i'm out i'm confused too i'm out [Music] lori you can help us bring this to millions of people around the world and i see you may be struggling a little bit but i think you want to do it problem for me is you know you only have so much time in here there's a lot to explain about your business model right and i don't think we've gotten a lot of those answers out you're asking for a million dollars for five percent you're losing money this is a prototype so you don't even know yet we don't actually have five of these uh countertops in the field but they're stainless steel models for coffee shops you came in asking for a pretty hefty sum it's just not investable for me right now i'm sorry i'm out joe what do you sell the stainless steel commercial unit 6.99 and what do they cost you to make 300 bucks 300 bucks all right guys look i thought you were nuts when you first walked out here but now i have a different opinion you did a very good job in presenting the opportunity i don't agree with my fellow sharks i get what you're doing it's extremely interesting i'm gonna make you an offer i actually think there's a huge fundamental demand for your product and i love watching marco nuts over uh plant-based stuff you know i'm a modified vegan i only eat vegan on tuesdays seriously yeah the structure is difficult here because you've already raised so much capital i would stick this in my venture debt fund and i'd do an offer like this i will loan you a million dollars at nine and a half percent interest for three years that will cost you eight thousand a month and i will take five percent equity that you offer you know i don't know what mark's gonna do but it gets you into my sphere of the shark world and you can talk to any of my entrepreneurs i do a hell of a job on digital for them so if you're going after consumers i can help you yeah so first of all i really appreciate the offer um we do believe you could bring a lot of value to the business it's not what we had in mind uh when we walked in here so we want to at least consider it's an offer absolutely it's great believe me i was not planning on giving you a million bucks when i first saw this thing [Music] okay so here's the thing so you've got three million dollars left in the bank for two products i obviously love the stainless steel version that you're putting in coffee shops right now i think that'll sell like hot cakes at home i think you'll sell a million units easily you have it priced at 6.99 i think could be priced at 8.99 and given your margin at that price you make 500 a unit that's a lot of money but with just three million dollars in the bank between marketing right and inventory and receivables and everything else you're not gonna have enough cash so you guys know coming in you're gonna have to negotiate so let's just cut to the chase five percent is not enough can you do six percent [Music] no what do you want okay guys here's my offer i'm gonna give you two million dollars you only ask for one i'm gonna give you two million dollars one million of that is going to be for seven percent equity the other million is going to be a loan at three percent interest but i get an additional three percent of stock as advisory shares or straight up equity but if you don't use the loan you don't have to give me the three percent equity for that loan so in total if you use all the capital it's two million dollars for ten percent do you have a little bit of flexibility we really want to work with you you can help us grow this it can be awesome a major global success you have a little bit of flexibility that was my flexibility it's a great offer mark we love it [Music] it depends how much you want to change the world is one percent going to change flexibility we're at five seven can't do six you came in asking for a million and now you have access to two million [Music] you got a deal yes sir i appreciate it guys joey you spoke up at the right moment congratulations guys good luck with everything we accepted congratulations but the work starts now exactly right we just did a 2 million deal with mark cuban he beat us up a little bit at the end but we couldn't be more excited to work with him and continue to grow new milk to be a great success you ", "Brightwheel": "my name is dave vassen i live in san francisco california with my wife samoyna and my daughter serena i'm a first generation american my parents came to the us from south america with almost nothing they taught me the importance of a strong work ethic and the value of an education how are we looking to get this out today after school i started working in education technology building software platforms for big companies like amazon and cisco but when my daughter serena was born everything changed i can't run i would leave for work every day i just found it so hard to not be a part of her day and how she was learning and growing i knew with my background and passion for education i could actually do something about it i developed a unique product that's focused specifically on early education it connects preschool and daycare teachers the parents and their children in a way that's never been done before 85 of brain development happens in the first three years of life and every study shows that the investment that you make has a massive impact not only on the individual but on the greater community these are our kids this is our future and this is something that we have to invest in [Music] hi sharks my name is dave vassen i'm the founder and ceo of brightwheel and i'm here seeking a 400 000 investment for four percent equity stake in my company brightwell is the mobile app for preschools daycares and families and we are completely revolutionizing early education now i believe all of us are parents here and i want to ask when you come home after a long day and you ask your kids what did you learn in school today does it sound familiar this is the experience for millions of parents across america every single day and especially for younger kids you've been apart from your little human being for six eight ten hours a day and that is all you get you know you want to be a part of their day you want to add to the learning once you come home and you can't it's gut wrenching and on the other side on the school side is no better in addition to actually educating our kids teachers are managing a ton of paperwork let's face it they're actually managing parents and on top of that they're even running a business the system is broken and brightwheel is the solution so let's jump in and take a look at how bright glow works so with brightwell teachers can easily check kids in from the mobile app they can log activities and assessments during the day they can send quick updates and they can even manage their business all in one place and we're just seeing an amazing amount of photos every single day on brightwheel and this is the reason you take it you tag it and you are absolutely done and now we're gonna look at the teacher app so this is the teacher's room and we're gonna click on activities at the bottom here and this is all being done on paper today and so we've taken it and combined it and made it super fast and super easy so we're gonna click on nap here and then we're gonna tag three kids that just went down for a nap and the key about brightwheel is that we're saving teachers time you actually have measurably more time with kids every single day and now we're going to flip over real quick to the parent experience so let's jump to the mobile app this is actually my little girl serena and this is her day and as you can see i get a sense of not only what she's doing but what she's learning and so when i come home i can actually have a conversation with her about it my connection with my little girl is so much deeper because of right wheel and by the way in the middle of a pretty tough day it doesn't hurt to get a photo like this sharks this is unique opportunity to build a massive business that has a massive impact on people's everyday lives and that's something that we hear every day so i hope you're joining serena and our team in bringing brightmill to every preschool every day care and every family across the globe are you selling me this platform this dashboard is that what's happening yes how much am i paying for right now you're paying nothing right wheels right wheels free today uh when we have our premium product you will be paying a monthly fee for that the parent will pay or i'll pay you will pay as the administrator or the owner and will the parent ever pay anything not today we're building a platform we see a lot of opportunity to add value to parents down the road except you can't advertise on that platform correct and we have no intention to advertise wait you can advertise to the parents all you want we don't want to we think there's a ton of ways that you can very hard time with that model no way no and we haven't we have no intention to so let me walk you through what brightwell's looked like so we started with a pilot in fall 2014. how many schools did you get yeah so we got 10 schools in the pilot with literally no product and so we worked with them we listened to them we understood their needs in june of this year we launched publicly as bright but we went from 10 and then now we have 2 500 schools in every state across the country wow so how are you going to monetize first i just want to say that when you look at other industries all of these industries have really great dedicated software that's provided by very large companies this is a massive market that doesn't have that and so that's what we see ourselves fitting in a lot of that has to do with the fact that they don't have money because they're very much small proprietors but they but they do have budget well they're just mismanaged i've got a four-year-old a two-year-old and a two week old and i pull my hair out sometimes looking at how the preschools are managed as a business right i offered to write software for my kids preschool and that's why they love it because we take all that off their hands so they have more time with kids you're doing so many things at once that makes it a little harder to pitch this yeah that may be where the opportunity lies too right you're doing something for schools something for parents something for teachers as well right we're in everything from four person in-home daycares uh even a lot of people are actually using us with nannies so a single person all the way up to elite chain of preschools so we're gonna offer at the low price point around forty dollars per month for a really small in-home daycare and that scales up to two hundred dollars and some of the instances of the top price is 200 that could be 50 kids right there's some very large centers including ones that we're in we're in centers with several hundred children so that's still 200 bucks yes have you raised any money from investors so based on the pilot we raised a seed round of 2.2 million and 8.2 million valuation besides money what do you want the shark to contribute to this uh to your venture we're taking on big challenges now we're looking to scale we're looking to build a global brand i'm not just here for money i'm not just here for pr i'm here for the partnership possibilities of bringing on sharks onto our team and the value that that adds we want to be the brand of early education the problem is the law of small numbers i mean i actually understand what you're doing and have been in your space i made a lot of money in it actually and i think it's brilliant i guess you've done something really interesting here i don't know what your plans are in the monetization so it's 1 million next year 6 million a year after that and 20 after that i believe it okay look i'll make you an offer i'll give you 400 000 but i want 10 i just bring too much kevin i appreciate that offer i really do and the fact that you want to be a part of this one more than the number of the experts said how how can like i understand it's like oh and look even even your background you sold an education company that is valuable what is challenging for me is our investors had my back as i trust you aren't that bad right how do i get you coming in i think you're gonna have that same frustration i mean you knew you'd have to negotiate right yeah yeah oh and i i i want to find something that works but i don't know if i can have value listen you have you have mark you have chris really savvy in that space you have kevin who understands child education uh i don't think i can help you i'm out i appreciate your time really do how many schools are gonna add this month so we're adding on average we had a 30 yesterday we're averaging about 40 to 50 a day so all right look i i really like this business i warn you not to promise like we're never gonna advertise et cetera because i do think you could add a lot of value with offers coupons people in this demographic actually want good products to be put in front of them and so i think that could be one fun channel i want to make you an offer but i have a hard time paying more than anybody else paid for the business particularly considering what i bring with my background the value i think i bring your platform so i'd like to give you the 400k you're seeking but at the 8.2 million dollar valuation of the last round we'll give you the 400k and we're off to the races can i ask you know first of all that is an amazing offer do you have any desire to team up with other sharks so if i'm looking at the other sharks and i'm going to let them into my deal i have to be convinced that the piece of the deal i have left is going to be worth more as a result as a result of that yeah and with your company i'm not convinced of that if we're if we're selling t-shirts or we only need something in bed bath and beyond i got people lined up translate says you guys are losers i don't want to get in the middle of anything you tell me what do you think you need from the rest of the line here are you serious are you really that clueless no i'm just i'm seriously are you really that clueless one shark is out dave has two offers on the table for his early education software platform brightwheel however things have become heated in the tank after dave suggested sharks go in on an offer together you tell me what do you think you need from the rest of the line here are you serious are you really that clueless no i'm just i'm seriously are you really that clueless i haven't heard you speak up mark i'm listening right chris i'm taking the offer i just want to know if we're going to team up with anyone are you you're taking the offer so you're not even listening to anything i want in with chris chris is going to add a ton of value i don't know if anyone else wants to join the ending questions yes what else do you need from somebody else and is anybody here nominating themselves is bringing someone to the table let me just have a nerd first of all i don't need to nominate myself i'm listening right so i don't need to convince chris of anything i have no problem with chris and the value he brings the other companies he has right when he assigns his name to it it holds a lot of street cred in his little part of the world once you get outside of that little bubble called silicon valley it doesn't mean as far as i know if you want if you want to create a brand value so that somebody who's working in texas pittsburgh maine florida and wants to have an extra level of confidence to say you know what this was validated by somebody that we trust something we know has a track record your job gets easier but that doesn't seem like a problem hang on while the two ends of the tank are squabbling like chickens i just want to point something out the only shark that's ever had a multi-billion dollar exit in your space is mr wonderful right this is my space right i know exactly how to help you and i think frankly i bring a lot to the table on that i'm not gonna fight with chris about whether he should be alone or not to get involved now i have to compete with his deal so i'm willing to match him because i have no choice i like the deal i really do the percentage isn't the issue because the shuffling deck chairs on the titanic either you're going to make it or you're not right right and so whether it's at 8.2 or 10 million that's not the issue are you considering making it over yeah i like it so i mean he's done most of the work it's going to be those other schools on the margin or being able to get to groups or being able to create confidence because the application does the job it does and it works great right so what creates the confidence that makes someone to say yes to a decision when maybe they don't understand it completely maybe they're not in the wheelhouse of how you're getting deals currently that's the biggest hurdle we're trying to cross dave when you're asking these guys in are you willing to give up more equity for more money and that's what i'm trying to figure out so they can even know how to position themselves i would consider we came in here with with a concrete ask in terms of a budget if it means getting more sharks and and having more people at the table then i would consider it i'll do it either way i think partnering with chris is smart and obviously you see the value there and i don't mind doing that you may not think there's value i'll leave that to him or i'll leave it to you and say i'll hit your number 400k at the price that you have at four percent at the at the 10 million yeah because i have enough confidence that i add enough value that it will probably so you're willing to do the deal at 400 pounds but i do regardless of what he said about me right i see the value there because um silicon valley is its own little world yeah yeah like uber operates in its own little world and twitter operates in its own little world and instagram operates its own little world i've never been outside of san francisco i'm sorry so let me let me ask then chris you know mark mark just just asked if you'd be open to teaming up for your deal is that something you'd be open to what if we do so at the valuation that mark talked about 300 from mark and 300 from chris we get it done and we build this thing together we're paying more than the last guys paid i think 25 more at that time we didn't have uh we don't do it to yourself we know the products we didn't have the brand we didn't have this team in place you didn't have shark tank either don't do it to yourself i'll do 300 and 300 at nine at a nine million dollar evaluation [Music] park would you do that yeah yeah let's do it all right perfect hug it out guys [Music] thanks guys you ", "Bouquet Bar": "first into the tank is what the entrepreneurs believe is a more elegant way to gift [Music] hi I'm Sal I'm Alex and

chocolates truffles we have about 22 screws and plus the two bouquets that we have what about shipping this is heavy before they attack you on the numbers it's okay we're ready how much does it cost to ship this because it's heavy as hell right now that box gets shipped or with our regional ship around 12 to 15 that's the shipping glass that's the shipping cost this is quality stuff what is an average uh cost of the small box to make with product and make the total cost both labor and everything it's about uh 20 on our small box we sell that box for fifty dollars okay second box cost about thirty four dollars to make all in we sell it for 75 last box it's a it's 155 dollars to make it 68 so how did you guys get into this business yes thank you Alex and I have known each other for about 10 years we actually own a luxury floral design company so I've I've been in a flower business for 25 years okay I had my first flower shop at 19. um I come from very humble backgrounds I had nothing coming to this country as an immigrant so flowers from where uh Iran Iran so um I came here to study my parents just put me in a plane say here's four grand go to America how old were you when you came over 15 and a half you were 15 and a half came by yourself yes I work at Burger King at night after school okay he has an immigrant myself nine years old my dad was selling pizzas from a motorhome sold ice creams and Parks you name it I sold flowers on a corner street I went to school by a chemistry major minor in econ wannabe doctor make that proud I was volunteering at the emergency room I'm pre-med I'm getting my degree older gentlemen came in all bloody and everything I said you know what this is not for me I can't do that so we came out with bouquet bar about two years ago and one day we sat down we said we're missing that right technology person Sal's a good friend of mine known him for years so my background is digital media technology in my previous job I co-founded a digital media company so for bouquet bar I'm in charge of all marketing and all technology how much revenue does your other business do about three million dollars annually okay kitties getting a piece of that business in this deal too well that's what you say so all of us me included have many many gifting companies I'm in the wedding business big time so let's just pick any one of them a Wicked Good Cupcakes the number one issue of the business has been for the last four years I've been involved is customer acquisition costs how's it going to work the data is uh our our custom customer acquisition is about sixty dollars we're using utilizing Google you know so you're not making anything at all now as of right now Kevin we just launched revenues in the last four months let's get to the numbers on sales close to a hundred thousand dollars close to a hundred thousand dollars how much are your money's in this business six hundred thousand dollars whoa wow and what about any external money or just your own money just just our own money what was the money spent on 300 000 of it was spent on developing the product coming out of the process website operations right now I really want to stress is that we have a 6 200 square foot facility with a cooler we have about three hundred thousand dollars worth of inventory that will translate to about a million to 1.2 million dollars and and revenue we're ready to scale what about the focus on the customer acquisition cost you've got to get it down to between 10 and 15 bucks then yeah exactly that's that's what our goal is and that's going to take a little bit of time well and now who is your customer great good question our customer right now is uh males and females between 35 and 55 60 female and 40 males what we want here to tell you is you know what we're going to teach people the gifts people are scared to gift they don't know how to get so I have to I have to call out the white elephant for me in the room this looks just like sugar Fina right sugar Phoenix started off with a box like this and they fill it with different candies it's sort of their trademark wait wait when people Google search they're gonna find sugar Fina and they're going to find you and sugar Fina is less expensive so to me you need to do something that is going to be different you are flower experts yes but you've got to think of how are you going to beat it or be more unique or different and we're already working on that Lori to answer that yeah sugarfina does have candies we do we do have a lot other stuff in in the play right now that I'm designing for the next lines to me if you would come in with really cool Innovative different gorgeous floral things and your price was great I'd be going to you Lord there is though I love your drive your passion and who you are but you haven't figured the business out yet and for that reason I agree with Lori I'm very familiar with sugar Fina as well I see the point of difference you're going for which is the mix of the candle and the bath bomb I think that's going to be easy for someone else to replicate your background it's incredible you guys should be very proud of yourselves but the point of differentiation is not big enough for me to invest so I'm out I think the people that don't know their gifting wrong don't know because when I was single 10 years ago my girlfriends I would always get them across ball a big fishing pole I lost a girlfriend but I had to learn that the hard way and I think the area that you need help is the area of educating people that they don't know and I think that's going to be very hard uh and it's going to cost a lot of money so I love this but I'm out let's talk about some other markets the wedding market for example if you look at the wedding Market billion dollar market 3 billion no one here is questioning the quality of this box it's one of the best we've ever seen on Shark Tank okay and it's one of those deals that's rare to me where I like a lot of it but not enough of it because I want to pour my 150 000 on the already solved customer acquisition problem and blow it up it's with heavy heart that I say I'm out okay now the Riff Raff's out of the way okay you've obviously looked at corporate gift selling you guys have bigger businesses where you have sales people or is it all walk in these people so can those sales people go out and sell and just work on a commission from their side yeah yeah how flexible are you to come up with different designs because it seems like the flowers are the hammer and everything else is the nail we're Innovative that way and I love I love to design more stuff all right so getting down to business 150k for 10 is not enough why did you guys think 10 was enough I think our ask is is not that High Mark honestly what we'll do is have valuation first number number one you have to put three or four companies together in order to create what we've created we're gonna need more money but we also what are you going to need more money for and when I you know basically in regards to like uh sales and operations and also Staffing the whole point of being a virtual e-commerce company is that you don't have to have a big staff and you can Outsource or you can virtualize a lot of it but you can get help to do that so why would you need to spend a lot more money I don't think I don't think a lot more money but you know what for for us or is it because you have all your money for example no no it's just you got to spend so much more no no no we have a hundred thousand dollars in the bank right now if I have to refinance my house if I have to put into this company I will do what what I'm gonna do I get that right I get that but the thing is right now look we have inventory we're ready to sell if you come and say look guys I want you guys to put this product in here it's not going to cost you that much expensive because it's not that heavy let's ship it we can do that right now we're ready we got the sales people to do it you have the people to do it here all right I'll make you guys an offer 150 000 for 20 non-negotiable they need an answer yes we're here all right all right congrats guys congratulations [Applause] [Applause] now we know what your wife is getting exactly right it'll save me so much money on flowers you have no idea should I call my dad I mean so much it's not about it's about living the dream you know people always say [Music] work hard and you know what I was in the tank and they're dropping off they're dropping off and I always watch TV and when people do something and I was like you know what say this say that say that and I was in the tank and I said don't give up don't give up whatever you say don't give up now the hard work begins before you go don't forget to subscribe to the Shark Tank Youtube channel and click on that notification Bell to keep up with everything that's bubbling in the

five hundred thousand dollars in exchange for four percent equity in our rapidly growing company at plated our mission is to help americans eat better josh and i met at harvard business school after school we both had the same problem getting good food on the table was difficult time consuming and expensive we knew there had to be a better way so we started plating plated delivers all the ingredients and the exact portions you need to make a chef designed delicious nutritious meal at home in 30 minutes or less you come to the site pick out only exactly what you want and how much and then we deliver all the ingredients along with recipe cards and instructional videos teaching you how to make a delicious dish at home since we launched six months ago we've served tens of thousands of meals around the northeast now we need you guys to take us nationwide sharks who's hungry so i want to see if i understand this right i order from a service they deliver right to my door my groceries and all i have to do then is just portion it out but then you still have to go find the recipe you have to figure out what you want to eat if i'm using a recipe card recipe card cookbook six one half thousand take you from zero to kitchen hero in 30 minutes our customers tell us that they love the experience of getting everything pre-portioned it's easy to make and the meal you say comes from all fresh and what does it cost starts at ten dollars per person you need to order four portions so it's a forty dollar minimum order pays shipping we do that that's included in the price is that sent overnight with an ice pack in it got it same day or overnight we have customers who literally write into us cold and tell us that twice a week they put the kids to bed and this is time with their spouse and it's a ritual and it's helping them you don't need to use your service to do that i'm very interested in understanding but they are in delta if i'm a family buying laurie's way or buying at their grocers over the course of a year how much more is the family paying to eat yep so here's here's where i think you're going with that you know where i'm going with it i have a lot of customers or grocery chains the margins are awful here's the dirty secret of grocery when you start out the gross margins are actually pretty good somewhere between 40 and 50 but then you have spoilage and overhead and that chews up 95 percent of the margin grocery store throws away in in some cases half of the perishable food plated delivers the amount of spice you need and not the 20 jar you get the amount of basil you need and not a giant thing that will will so you can make the argument you're saving money because you're not we're throwing a little away less than one percent of what we order every week let's talk about money for a second well yeah i think i understand that they've been doing this for how long seven months tell us about the actual numbers you've had so much our margins today are 40 right those will go to 60 at scale 350 000 in total sales but 100 000 that was last month tell me the projection for the next six months calendar year two and a half million in sales and in the next 12 months we'll do about 10 million in sales okay we project a million dollars a month in revenue by the end of the year so you're ramping up every month we're growing at over 40 percent each josh how much cash did you have to spend to start the business we put in north of 50 000 to start and then you raised how much money to date about three million dollars what valuation host money nine and a half million dollars okay talk to me about expansion we'll have a half a dozen or so hubs around the country we have two active now from our warehouse in brooklyn and our warehouse outside of chicago we cover the entire northeast and the entire midwest we're starting in san francisco in about four weeks tell me about your background i was doing tech startups before worked in finance for a bit and met nick at business school josh is super modest he's a great engineer come out of georgia tech spent five years building a software business i went to dartmouth college undergrad i did the joint degree at the kennedy school harvard business school went to the marine corps after hbs wow so very only person to ever do that yeah how long you got to do more with your lives you haven't done enough so i did a year active duty i became an infantry officer and now i'm still in the reserves wow that's great have you considered once you've captured that customer perhaps there comes a week when they're so busy that they need the food prepared totally know where you're going with that and the different product lines are six months from now coming out but there's a ton of competition there there was a cheap finish but this is about a brand right we are building an amazing brand we put a lot of time into this yeah but you guys are obviously really smart guys but i mean i i can't go along for the ride unless i buy into the concert what are you doubting personally i love to eat healthy but i wouldn't order something that i have to cook cooking is believing when people try this they come back this this is a game changer because it allows you to have an experience you would not have otherwise right josh look you've had great answers i just can't get over having to make it i can't invest in something that i would not use on some level we'll send you a free trial i would like to get your feedback afterwards send it to his wife she definitely wears the pants in the family i've seen it my wife wouldn't use it and i wouldn't use it you know for that reason i'm out the question is how much of a premium lies an investor paying for the risk that this is not proprietary anywhere i think i can do the whole thing for three million bucks instead i have to pay three times that multiple to play with you [Music] go go find two hard chargers who are smart data driven they're gonna knock it out of the parking garage you know what i cook a lot the trouble i'm having with this is that if you're somebody who cooks and i think most people in america cook if you do you don't really need somebody to send you in a box the ingredients because you go to the grocery store that's not their customer but wait wait wait yeah i don't wonder if it wasn't though think about it like instead of going and ordering takeout i mean that greasy thing of thai food but you still have to cook it that that's where i have a little bit of difficulty i'm seeing it as your customer is somebody who's too busy to cook so for that reason i'm out who do you see is your biggest competition right now and your greatest threat take out well that's pretty big take out is your enemy and that's a big one and you know what takeout has over your concept you could decide tonight what you're in the mood for eating and get it to your table and eat within the hour it's done so that is an obstacle this isn't for me i'm out guys i would not be a customer that said i don't have to be a customer for a lot of things that i take interest in the real question is how do you preempt competition how do you make this so that it's an actual company as opposed to turning into a feature from any of the high-end so to touch on that the back-end logistics are not easy also we're signing customers up for the year-long contracts okay tell us about that you can either buy just all a cart whenever you'd like or you can subscribe and save but how many subscribers do you have to that several thousand people okay but this is this is their beauty of the business by the way we don't need a lot of customers to make this a giant business okay so guys i'll make you an offer [Music] i'm gonna offer you 500 000 at the 9 million valuation which is about 5.5 5.6 we'll figure that out and in addition i want advisory shares whatever the best deal you give to any other of your advisors that's what i want do we have a deal so you're so you're talking about 500k right at a 9 mil yeah you said you left it open what we were looking for yeah at our at our evaluation exactly can we talk about real quick why do you need to talk you basically told us this is what you want so either you want to do business we want you to be a part of this we need we need to make sure that our numbers are working with you i wouldn't leave that room with that seriously though i mean what am i missing here because you said you wanted advisory support right yeah i mean i don't know what there is to talk about because i'm giving you pretty much what you asked for [Music] hey there was no doubt these guys have a solid business partner there's no doubt about that yeah i mean look there's risks as raja any business but in this particular case the horse is a decent horse the jockeys are great jockeys and when you might learn to cook mark i'm not gonna learn how to cook you ", "MuteMe": "next up is a product inspired by our new work from home normal [Music] hi sharks my name is Parm like parmesan I know it's cheesy I'm from Sacramento California and the CEO of mute me and I'm ty like the tie that you wear and I'm also from Sacramento California and the CFO we're here today asking for 200 000 in exchange for 10 of our company mute me and joining us virtually today are our two other co-founders and wives and even Brittany hi sharks I'm so excited to be here today my name is Han deep and I'm the chief operating officer at Mutiny I'm Brittany and I'm the chief marketing officer at Mutiny we wish they could be here with us today yeah right they're so lucky we let them on the tank we're the real talent we should have been on there tell me about it you know what took Thai a month to memorize his five lines I had them down in a day we would have been Flawless we would have been we can hear you there's got to be a better way well now there is sharks this is mute me the world's first illuminated mute button you press mute me when you need to be muted the lights change color so it's never disputed tap it again when it's your turn to speak the light stops you from letting the wrong words leak it's a perfect tool when you're multitasking or when you have a co-worker like Mr Wonderful who keeps on ranting it helps others around you know if you're busy no more wondering hey he's not on a call is he stainless steel is super neat custom engraving it can't be beat it's the hottest product of the year no more conference call slip UPS or fears whether you're working or learning our button makes things easy don't worry we know this rhyme's pretty cheesy sharks we hope you found our pitch just a little bit funny but mute yourselves it's time to make some money so run through really quick all the scenarios just give me like four or five where you think someone would use this so 2020 one of the top lines that was used was you're on mute now at times have you heard a dog bark doorbell ring different scenarios well someone's talking and they don't realize they're on mute everyone's trying to get their attention and they just don't have that indication that they are why not just do a browser extension though and just make it really really big on the screen where everybody's looking because it takes up the screen real estate you don't want to take up additional space on your screen there's like eight different conferencing platforms right when you're interfacing with all those different conferencing platforms it's not easy so our button you plug it in you press the button it mutes and unmutes how much you selling them for we're selling them for 39 retail and what do they cost to make it's 11.62 cents right now how did you come up with this and tell us about your background we actually have a mutual friend that came up with the idea I worked on a remote working project with him two years ago and Tai is a technical marketing manager at the largest all remote company in the world so we decided to go down the path of developing something ourselves we prototyped it in about a month launched a Kickstarter and it just takes off and so we ended up yeah so we did so we did 145 000 on Kickstarter dollars or units dollars and Indiegogo was 135 000 so we did did 280 000 in crowdfunding what about real sales what's happened we've done uh 61 000 61 000 how just how did you sell them on our website you'll want to know also we are in every Staples in the United States you are the last four weeks but what if they sold in these last four weeks so we've sold just over 150 units that's it where are they putting it in the store very front if you walk into a Staples right now there's a table there what have they said about the feedback because 150 units is low they haven't promoted Us in any marketing yet and that's to come the next couple weeks they're promoting you because they're basically got walk-in trade and it's the first thing you see you portfolio overall everywhere is not where it should be as of right now hold on hold on I think Peter's asking a great question I mean to back that up though is did they tell you the test on how many doors they're putting you in 1067 stores every store in the United States we've gone to a lot of stores and and the one thing that we're trying to get them to do most often is you see the value in the illumination yeah that's something that the stores run a battery pack and the battery pack dies you've got to come up with a way to sell it do some fun with it on Tick Tock you have got to be great content creators you're a product and you haven't figured out how to sell it I mean you're not even close that's what I think you need to be successful so for those Reasons I'm out I'm sorry to hear that Mark I think this goes to zero in retail in about 90 days there'll be a discount banned for nine bucks that's not a problem this should be completely done online part of the strategy is actually a business to business strategy because the top is stainless steel it can be laser engraved with any logo so we've had a lot of customers we're selling for a second because I want a minute just to drop out I'm gone I'm out I'm history thank you sorry to hear that what you've done here is you've created a great product that's come out of the pandemic I've got a company in Asia it's like the third or fourth largest Gadget Company online we sell tens of Millions worth of gadgets and I'm thinking could I sell this I think I could but sadly it's going to be a race to the bottom on price that's where I think it's at you have other competitors in this market so we're first to Market there are some competitors out there that are trying to they saw our Kickstarter and decided to ramp up at all on it we do we have a provisional patent so we're the only mute button that isn't a microphone yeah so we're the only mute button that's not a microphone and is illuminated we have factors and shins in I can make this for you now we love the work we would love to work yeah you've got no proprietary circuit board in here this is probably volume less than 70 or 80 cents in time yeah we we are currently manufacturing it at 11 ouch we would love to work with any one of you I'll give you an offer but the problem is I have to redo your business every one of the Sharks said something that's critical you know you got to make these things for a dollar fifty and at the end of the day this gotta be 19.99 maybe 14.99 I mean certain companies are you know targeting like 9.99 so anyway unfortunately I have to give you a very short fuel for a 200 000 for uh 50 50. that's not an unreasonable offer for what you guys got here the evaluation is crazy it is crazy but I have to put so much work and I'm probably gonna have to give percentages to a bunch of people why don't you see if he get it off from somebody else if you don't that's the only offer you got well if you don't get it for somebody else then it's going to go up who's still in are we the three of us no I hate this tell us what you really think listen guys I see the benefit of it I'm so on the fence about it and whenever I feel that way I have to go with my gut and I'm so sorry but I'm up guys so ah I'm really torn torn towards us no I'm really torn if I do this and I'd go back and my guys say what the are you doing because you're just investing in a button that goes red and green tomorrow and I and I just I feel really quite worried about it you know what guys I'm out the thing is there's a lot of simple things out there that sell well just because it's simple so guys necessarily means seriously guys I'm really sorry but I'm gonna have to say I'm out foreign that's a tough one yeah they messed up um I think they look at something and they think it's simple they don't necessarily you know think that this is gonna grow but I know it's going to grow it's going to be something that's going to end up on a lot of students desks they're going to be sorry in a couple years and that's okay that's going to be the ring doorbell all over again the ring doorbell all over again the only good thing about this is if it actually worked for real on people that's ", "Slice of Sauce": "first into the tank is an innovative way to add flavor to sandwiches [Music] hi sharks i'm emily williams and i'm cole williams emily's husband and we're seeking 200 000 in exchange for 10 of our business we're not here to talk about a problem we're here to talk about catastrophes we're talking sandwich catastrophes how about those pesky packets they're tough to open impossible to spread in their never the right amounts and what about soggy buns that's the worst fear not my sharky friends your saucy heroes have arrived with slice of sauce slice of sauce transforms traditionally bottled condiments like ketchup sriracha barbecue sauce mustard and more into mess free slices it's flavor in a new form just like a slice of cheese but it's your favorite condiment or sauce we use only the finest ingredients and a unique process to bring bold flavor and the perfect bite every time so sharks who wants a slice of this sauce so are we ready to eat let's see yes hungary's always ready to always so you guys in front of you you have a grilled cheese sandwich with slice of sauce classic ketchup and spicy sriracha which does have some heat oh wow yeah packs a punch got some kick yeah this is pretty damn cool let me just tell you that is a good idea thank you is this real ketchup that's just been the water's been removed we are removing the water yeah so what's proprietary about that why can't you be knocked off by the big ketchup guys very good question a couple of reasons um one we do have a unique process we've opted for trade secrets so we've forgone the patents we also have licensing agreements on deck with mccormick and stubbs and frank's tapatio and secret aardvark how long is the shelf life of this because it's not refrigerated right correct it's an ambient product it has a 12 month shelf life it's interesting i mean it's almost like a fruit roll-up yeah but this is ketchup we liken it a lot yeah a slice of cheese right it's the same use case it tastes really good thank you thank you what does this sell for and what is the cost to make that retails for 5.99 our cost is 1.75 so do you think that's high you only get eight servings you can dress eight hamburgers it's over whereas with my tomato ketchup bottle i'm gonna have it for what maybe 20 30 hamburgers we are a premium product and we would like to stay positioned that way this really isn't just a slice of ketchup this is flavor what are your sales so far so we launched a kickstarter campaign in 2018 and it went viral within about four days we raised thirty four thousand dollars and our sales after that point where we worked we are still pre-revenue and we'll launch in november and i'd love to tell you about what we've been doing over the last two years because just so we're clear yeah no sales you put the kickstarter on in 2018 and here two years later you're still pre-revenue correct so the question is yeah so we discovered really quickly that manufacturing this is really hard so how are you making these we've been manual and which is why we have not yet launched is because we've had such huge can't find a co-packer to take this and run with the machinery we do need machinery and that's why we're here today this barber to your point will help us bring down costs how much money have you put into it yourself we've invested about 120 000 of our own cash and we've also raised about 500 000 whoa we raised from who we raised a friends and family round of 300 on a convertible note at a three million dollar cap we also participated in techstars accelerator they gave us a hundred thousand dollars this is a down round the last valuation is actually at five million so it is in fact a serious discount because we really want to partner with a shark i have to say i find it absolutely amazing that you're able to raise 300 000 from your family and friends plus a hundred thousand dollars and say confidently that you have this valuation when there hasn't been a single bag sold i would like to believe in that kind of magic because i love magical things but i don't and so for that reason i'm out thanks barbara thank you barbara what is your plan for growth and what is your plan for world domination yeah oh my gosh our focus for the first 12 months is really online we know that there's a retail play here we've had a lot of retail interest we don't want to go there first because it's expensive but then after we we do head into retail there's a food service play um whether it is stadiums or quick service restaurants or uh grabbing grab-and-go sandwich kiosks to me it's extremely important to know three things when you're trying to bring to market a product is it something that people need and want can it be done at an affordable price and does it solve a problem right right so you you gave the problem i don't think it's a huge problem of not being able to carry around your condiments but the complexity here for me is i don't know the need and is it something that can be made an affordable price you don't know yet so i like the innovation but i'm out i think the sharks have a good point and i don't know how you're going to address it because you don't have enough data yet but i'm going to make you an offer structured against the risk i see here because you need a shark to help blow this thing up i'm going to give you the 200 000 and i'm going to put a royalty structure on it to a limit of seven hundred thousand in other words i want a tin excuse me mark i don't need any noise buckle your seat belts exactly clip clips emily does know numbers do you want to hear the offer or not yeah let's go because right now it's the only offer you have so i suggest you focus absolutely all right i'm going to give you the 200 000 against a 10 cent royalty per package until i recoup 700 000 and the royalty goes away and i'm going to ask for five percent equity i'm the only chef up here chef wonderful the rest of these guys are ignorant in the ways of the kitchen he said his offer is better than nothing maybe nothing's better than that yeah well let's hear your offer alex what are you forecasting revenue year one we'll start in november and we're forecasting one point eight one point eight you're going to accomplish that but we have our website we have amazon and we have thrive market um that we're going to partner with amazon will be interesting but you got to go through such a process to educate people right i mean emily you know the only offer you have is some chef wonderful now as these sharks drop out that gives me more i don't know leverage and my offer may change two sharks are out emily and cole have an offer on the table from kevin for their unique condiment company slice of sauce does anybody else yes i would start asking that that would be a good idea okay let's drill down i see these as a proof of concept that are going to be really hard to sell no chance you're doing 1.8 million of these selling online because people aren't going to know what to expect in term of taste right it's the weird stuff that you otherwise would not have in your refrigerator that are that's going to work what are the things you hit the key too it's refrigerator we're not looking at the refrigerator we're looking at places where the refrigerator isn't right so it's a picnic it's a it's a camping trip there's an rv but you've got to look at it where my buying decision is made because you're a new category people aren't going to think i need sliced ketchup it's just not going to happen it sounds like you're on the fence obviously mark you're on the fence i'm not i'm going to make them an offer okay do what you gotta do we live on the road we have four kids we're watching football games concerts baseball but you said something earlier code that i really liked mess free yeah now with four kids that's a premium at my house so there's two rules in investing as i see it rule number one is don't lose money right rule number two is don't forget rule number one yeah okay so i'm gonna make this investment as convertible debt okay i'm gonna offer you two hundred thousand dollars for twenty percent when you hit your 1.8 it will convert into equity okay that's my offer okay you understand the dilution of that i do would you do it for 15 alex so guys before you jump before you go i'll do it for 15 but that means you can't listen to mark what are you gonna do i would take mr wonderful's offer like that why give up all that equity just to be clear co and emily i'm investing 200 000 as a convertible node which means if you don't hit the 1.8 in sales it would stay as debt on the business okay okay got it um would there be um options for po financing and uh lines of credit on top of the 200. i would consider that yes um alex you have a deal all right thank you thank you thank you oh my god you can't pass up a good offer and we had one from alex and i have no regrets at all no regrets i'm curious whether mark was really going to make an offer right absolutely what was yours 200k for 20 i didn't think they get an offer from anybody but they found two stupid people you ", "PDX Pet Design": "[Applause] first into the tank is a couple with an innovation in pet products [Music] hi sharks let me introduce ourselves i'm tara and i'm jason we're the founders of pbx pet design and today we're asking for 300 000 for 15 of our company now jason and i are of the generation that grew up online with computers so naturally we met online we eventually got married and you know what happens we adopted more cats the problem with cat toys today it's this they're cute they're colorful but when you take them home your cats play with them for about five minutes these guys are basically thrown away imagine instead you could walk into a pet shop and there'd be an entire aisle dedicated to the wellness of your cat with products that enhance your kitty's lifestyle and really help you improve your relationship with your cat well that's what we are doing at pbx pet design for our first product we created shrew the intelligent cat companion as you can see in the video shrew entertains your cat while you're out for the day now we designed shrew to mimic a small animal's motion so it ignites the hunting instinct of your little tiger it's basically going to be your cat's new bff for our next product we looked at the fact that cats groom each other as a form of social bonding there's also evidence to suggest that your cat thinks you're a big cat not a human so why should you be left out of their intimate bonding ritual well with wiki brush you don't have to be left out anymore licky brush is a tongue shaped brush you can use to finally lick your cat just like a mama cat likes her young no you're not gonna stick that in your mouth are you no [Applause] kevin kevin demonstrate how it's done oh my gosh oh you're joking oh they're freaking i'm not joking you're joking no so who wants to join us on the quest to improve kitty lives around the world [Music] [Laughter] [Music] somewhere you need to drop a mic right about now we're gonna give each of you guys a cat and a licky brush and a shrew so you can test it out oh no you're not oh yes we are i want a kiss what's the name of the cat chestnut chestnut is now psychologically disturbed robert if you can take a cat jason what happened man what happened to you man this has been a viral hit and i bet it has i'll try it with the real cat hi baby so you just put in your mouth and you want to lick her with the grain right you don't want to go against the grain any pet owner oh my god so you just hold her nice and tight there you go nicely done oh my god oh my god i hate myself so much right now people use it and they say this is a wonderful bonding experience with their animal but like what's the difference if you were to put this in your mouth and lick the cat or if you were just yeah i'm just rushing her and she likes it then it's just a brush okay guys i want to take it seriously because you asked for 300 dollars before i saw you lick a cat well we don't know what their sales are how many did you sell to date we have sold about two hundred and uh fifty thousand dollars worth of shrew and about fifty two thousand dollars worth of lucky brush we have five other designs in the pipeline right now and we think they're gonna be equally viral we know how to talk to people on the internet about cats what did you guys do before like lickety-split well i'm an electrical engineer by trade which makes perfect sense jason's created shrew and leaky brush himself we have not outsourced any of the contracting engineering we do everything and i work on the business management side of it i actually went to the university of waterloo mr wonderful you did yeah and then i went on to uh explore phd in neuroscience are you a canadian sure am she's targeting you she thinks you might be a cat i'm gonna make sure they throw you out of the country did we ever ask you how much it sells for no you haven't okay the msrp today is 119 109 what's the licking brush sell for pre-order is 19 msrp's for a like that's cool guys can you just give me for this year combined what total sales will be in your forecast between the liquor and the egg uh our projected sales for this year are 180 000 so what would make you think that you could price this business at over 2 million in valuation we're really focused on future revenues so we can give you the money five years from now you can't but i'm gonna be looking for a lot more because i know we're gonna double our revenue next year and the year after and i've never heard anybody say i promise we're gonna fail this is so crazy i mean it's just well you guys know as soon as this episode airs we're gonna it's this episode's gonna go viral i wanna explain you something really important everybody says i wanna go viral i'm gonna go them up you said you went back we had like 20 million but your sales from that was 250 000 on the one and 52 on the other for going viral i think it should be higher i'm out you lori i appreciate that i i have to tell you sales aren't there i'm sorry i'm out thank you robert listen i wish you wouldn't answer so much so soon i mean you only really have a little proof of concept i don't i don't know how you get around that number everybody has the same problem you ask for too much i'm just thinking i go back to my office meet my team say i gave them 300 grand and i stick this in my mouth and they look at me and say i'm getting a job somewhere else now well that's just one project though it's impossible to get back together guys simplified look you've had fun with it obviously you've owned it so it's become more than just a business right as part of your personality looking for for a big break you didn't price this asking for a big break if you guys had come in and said you know what believe in us 50 grand for 20 of the company we all grow together i think we'd all be in it then somebody could take a flyer yeah but 300k that's too much and for those reasons i'm out thank you mark you know just reminds me of a whole story a cop old school irish cop he's walking out of black woman runs up to him oh my god my cat's in the tree he looked up in the tree and he said lady you see any cat skeletons hanging around up in the street sooner or later the cat's gonna come down they'll have to work it out we can't help with that valuation you're gonna have to work it out by yourself i'm out thank you demon thank you damon so mr wonderful we haven't heard from you i i tell you i'm worried about my my daughter my son would look at me saying what happened to you dad what what why did you do it we made you a lot of money you're not worth 300k now it's just too much money for this i'm out guys i just want to say how happy i am that you met each other thank you coming so much we wish you good luck of course we're disappointed everyone wants to get a deal but we also we have backup plans we have penny pos we are going to build this company and so this isn't the end for us that was why do i do shark tank because you never know when someone's gonna lick a cat you ", "Swimply": "next up is a way for everyone to cool down in the summer heat [Music] hey sharks my name is bonham alaskan i am from lakewood new jersey and i'm seeking 300 000 dollars in exchange for five percent of my company wow swimply global warming am i right sharks it's an epidemic that is sweeping our planet the global surface temperature is increasing by over 1.6 degrees fahrenheit across the board and it's only going to get hotter what if i told you that i had the solution introducing swiftly [Laughter] maybe i haven't found the solution for global warming just yet but i did find an amazing way for all of us to get together and make the world just a little bit cooler swimply is the first of its kind online marketplace for pool sharing where anyone can book their own private pools by the hour whenever they want from people who own a pool but don't use it too often so say you're like my good friend jesse jesse's like most americans and can't afford his own private pool all he has to do is visit our website or app find a pool lock it in and just like that jesse's booked himself the perfect poolside day and pool owners can now monetize their pool's downtime even make a profit simply is quite literally throwing the biggest pool party the world has ever known and you're all invited we'll be the first to jump in i'm not getting in with that guy wait is this really for real it's for real he's happy basically you're like airbnb for pools exactly so is the app alive on the app's alive so how many downloads you have how many users how much revenue you don't how many pools do you have and who in the world thought this was a good idea i'm me uh so um the story behind simply is actually a personal solution for me my next-door neighbor built the pool for her grandkids and they didn't show up as much as maybe the grandmother supposed and the pool was always empty i sort of asked her if i would be okay if my family used their pool very consciously aware of the amount of money she recently put into it she asked me if it'd be okay if my family helped her out we worked out a deal we helped her pay 25 of her expenses in case and exchange my family used their pool before long our entire block was using a pool and i wanted to bring us as many people as possible i thought it was crazy when you walked in here with this but now that i listened to the story of how it occurred it's crazy what's happening so tell us so i put together my business for money and i launched a small website i went on google earth i found 80 people that had pools and knocked on 80 of them good for you for doing that 76 said no uh but we got our first yeah so we got our first four yeses and our four pools quickly escalated to 32. um i raised 30 grand uh to launch an mvp i spent the whole 40 grand on the website just to hiring a developer and a designer so wait how much bar mitzvah money did you burn initially 10 grand okay but in this library's 30 grand to make the site not crash so i launched a swim plate and immediately we did around 900 hours worth of reservations luna am i'm worried you're going to spontaneously compete no i want to say i'm going faster how much faster you can talk you said 900 hours 900 hours of both so we get our first 100 pools then the website i didn't really have the funds to keep the the operation going i spent that summer using that beta to just um raise 960 grand um 960 grams 9.60 yeah wow wow how much of the company did you have to sell to right i raised it at a 6 million valuation how did you do that a full maintenance partnership reached out to us and um that has stores all over the country what have you booked in hours year-to-date in march 2019 i raised 960 grand the first thing we had to do was develop a proper website that would scale so this is your third time trying to develop a proper website but go ahead this is really the first the first two times are really uh yeah but they still count that was still 40 grand go ahead okay we try to build this so this app and this website in three months to get it out there in time for summer today there were malfunctions we got the product out there would you take a minute i should have to take a breath okay go ahead so this year today we booked individual 600 hours can you walk us through the financial model how much do you make what is the pool owner charge walk us through that so at the moment we let our hosts charge whatever they like and then their host set limits so some will have a five percent limit some have a 25 limit and then they can set additional fees for every person after a certain amount and how do you get paid from that we have a double-sided a business model we take 15 commission from the host and we try to swim an additional 10 service fee so 25 total 25 total and how much have you made year to date we did around 215 000 dollars that's not to use that's growing that's gross marketplace revenue our net is around 20 percent of that so you've made 42 000 net revenue yes this is incredible you raised a million dollars for this idea is that why you price the stock so very high because based on your revenue it makes no sense so it's a game of scale and it's a game of promise and it's game of vision right and that's exactly what we're doing it's a game of money right let me tell you my thoughts okay okay i fly a lot and in the summer months when you fly over you will see pool after pool after pool and they're empty all these people own pools and there's nobody ever in them so i think that in some ways you're really on to something but i just don't know if i want to invest in this even though i think there's a need so i'm sorry i'm out [Music] where did they go to the bathroom when it comes to bathrooms those have two options well they're the two options renting have a third option right now fifty percent of our pools do offer the way to use a side door but what's the second option for back the second option is not offering one but if you don't offer one aren't people going to pee in the pool i think jesse's paying in the pool right now but i don't think you've given a sense of what someone's willing to pay to use that pool so there's right so i guess now is a good time and if i can couple the second part of that question do your customers typically come back and reuse the pool once a week or is it a one-time event okay last year the average hour booked was 45 an hour this year the average was 90 an hour and how many people book it for a hundred bucks an hour like is there five people coming over three people two people so last year the average amount of people per booking was around seven this year the average amount of people were booking is 12. i mean i think the whole idea is really nuts maybe i'm not listening you're what we call a fast talker in the business you think yeah yeah i never met anyone faster um but i just don't get it so for all of those reasons i'm out okay i can see where this is of value you know to to get 12 friends together and set up a party at someone else's pool and it only cost me three or four hundred bucks for a sunday fun day i can see that not being bad the the challenge though is how many times can you do that how many kids can you get to know about this to throw parties together that comes down to how often do people do this right so last year when the average price of the pool were 50 an hour 70 of our bookings were families 70 were families in the beta okay what about 2019. in 2019 we had an issue this year we inserted swimply chat which allowed people to facilitate pool parties and stuff like that but the problem was that we did run into technical issues when it came to notifying people that when you requested a pool from somebody a person would approve it you wouldn't find out about it for four hours that's a problem [Music] three hundred thousand for five percent that computes a six million valuation you're basically making 20 grand this year around that yeah yeah that that's kind of crazy i know okay and maybe upset me and excite you is the fact that we had 675 thousand dollars worth of bookings that went through the platform oh let me modify that are we only capitalizing 150 i can take kinda out of that sentence it's just plain crazy okay if the valuation's nuts no i'm not our projections for next year right we're breaking given this doesn't accept you our projections for the year afterwards is we're profiting 15 million dollars and that's just the usb is that your gross or the overall our profits your profit our profits our gross by 2022 will be 289 million dollars marketplace revenue look it's great to be excited right it's great to be committed every great entrepreneur has to be but self-awareness has to be a great trade as well not lying to yourself what we're talking about here is that we took a product this year we had three months to build as mentioned there were 675 000 worth of business that went through the platform uh only 150 a little less than twenty percent actually was able to proceed and that is all again not anecdotal this is product issues and it's something that that doesn't mean that doesn't mean it scales what i'm saying is that there's potential there were issues that we just where you're pricing your price we are a tech company your potential and your reality are in two different universes i'm out okay are you sure come on hear me out i'm 23. he's out he's 20 years old i threw my first business when i was in eighth grade i get it you're a hustler right i get it the objections is bothering you let me just tell you something this is you know what projections are worth but yes right they're worth nothing nothing focus on who's the only shark look i when you came in here i thought it was really crazy i think that you can help a lot of us you gotta work with these guys hey robert 289 million in two years is never three years it's not linear it's just crazy it's how hard startups grow it is all about scaling is all about growth how many companies go from zero to 289 million in three years zero none it's not zero and we have 675 thousand dollars of proof of concept on 80 of our pools the twenty percent of our pools that are optimized that manage to attract six hundred and seventy five thousand dollars for scale for insurance and i'm the only person doing this with two customer service representatives this is something that we can really blow up these guys okay thank you guys thank you very much hey hope you don't freeze getting out of there i don't regret bringing up our projections they are ambitious that is what i'm trying to do that is the vision that i'm um executing on and if those that vision did scare them or that wasn't something that they'd be on board for maybe it wasn't a good match i'm brandon i'm stephen and i'm bruno and we're the owners of sandcloud we love the beach and we stay on the beach all the time right after work one of these days we woke up from the beach super uncomfortable and looked at each other and had this idea of putting a pillow inside a beach top and that's when we first came up with our million dollar idea the pillow top we created the product tried selling it on the beach and that's when we realized it was a total fail nobody wanted it hey how's it going guys we took this opportunity and talked to every single person on the beach to figure out exactly what they wanted and that's when sand club was born as millennials having a business with a social impact is everything to us so we decided to donate 10 of profits to protect marine life have you guys seen our numbers today we've risked everything we moved in together we sold our cars because there's no other option this is it it's not just about us it's about making a difference in the environment and actually making a difference in the world [Applause] [Music] hi sharks my name is brandon i'm stephen and i'm bruno and we're the owners of sandcloud today we're seeking an investment of 200 000 in exchange for 8 of our company we live just steps away from one of the most beautiful beaches in san diego it was here that we realized it was time for a long-awaited change to the standard towel towels since their inception are inherently plain unimaginative oh my god yeah baby that's it i didn't even catch that and worse yet not so wonderful [Laughter] you think there's a chance in hell you're getting 200 from me i'm out we knew that it was time to introduce some new options yeah for a new generation and that's why we started sand cloud our unique and vibrant patterns will ensure that you turn heads wherever you go all of our towels are handcrafted from the finest turkish cotton making them both lightweight and multi-functional these perfect gifts can be used at the beach as a decorative tapestry or even as a stylish scarf in the winter literally the possibilities are endless but most importantly our towels connect people to a bigger purpose with every sand cloud purchased we donate to preserve our oceans and marine life in fact we want to show you a video of one of our charity partners releasing sea lions back into the ocean here for you guys after rescuing them earlier this year that's great sharks we are not just looking for money today we are looking for a mentor to help guide us to the next level now which one of you sharks wants to wrap up in a sand cloud and help us make a difference now bruno is going to go around the room and pass some samples for you thank you thank you thank you here's our baja beach blanket this is our best-selling towel cool our wonderland which one the wanderlust tie-dye [Music] so brandon it's very thin yeah it this i wouldn't think this would make a good towel after i got out of the water right well those are all actually handmade in turkey from fine turkish cotton actually all in villages in turkey by families so it's really good quality and that's why we charge forty seven dollars for it because it feels like a wrap as opposed to a towel yeah because i mean maybe it's just how we're conditioned but look i started my own company with my first commission check the first thing i did was buy nice thick fluffy towels because they just feel so luxurious right actually yeah when we first started our company we the first thing we wanted to do we went to the the towels that were thicker and luxurious and when we tested the market selling one by one by two at the beach we found out that people wanted something different and they wanted something that was easy to carry in their backpack easy to fit in their purse fair enough so this is more as a beach product for the beach as opposed to in your home and you're in you're like more about raptor yes so the great thing about these is because you know because of the light weight in the material it doubles as a sarong and what we've seen a lot is people hanging up in their house is tapestry so how much is this that one is actually 47. 47. and what's your cost our cost on that is 10 so we have an 80 mark because it's really about the whole lifestyle give back right baby exactly we see ourselves as the next homes of the sea because millennials need a social cause to get behind in order to support you everybody has a social cause now every 100 of millennials that come in selling and it's all about college right the three of us we own 100 of the company good for you we've been in business for about two and a half years now our first year in business we did 30 000 in sales year two we did 430 000 and this year so far to date we've done over 1.6 million and we're on track for three million all right good for you guys what are you gonna make now we're at massive sales what are you gonna make on the three million the three men will make eight hundred thousand dollars why only eight hundred thousand when you have 80 margins because we invest a ton back into our brand so you guys it seems that the main focus of this is as a beach towel and i look at it as not a beach towel but more as a wrap and a scarf so i don't think i would really be the right partner for you because we have completely different thoughts on what the product's use is so for those reasons i'm out thank you appreciate it what's the 200 000 for so 200 000 the one area that we need to help with is rebuilding our website and optimizing it and who's doing that do you hire somebody to do it or somebody internally we grind it out we learned how much are you spending per day and is it mostly facebook you tend to do campaigns we spend all our budget in a short period of time like one month or a month and a half so during the summer we spent quarter million dollars in advertising over what period of time uh over 90 days less than 90 years all on friday so yeah so 2 500 3 000 a day basically it turns into over a million dollars in sales and a quarter million in profit okay so you're doing three or four x basically yes not bad so that should be generating a lot of cash we do have cash in the bank uh we have over three hundred thousand dollars right okay so we have 160 000 inventory that we've built finally okay guys i'll make you an i'm gonna make you an offer it needs to be worthwhile for me and it needs to be worthwhile for you so i'm gonna offer you 400k but i need 25 so we're all in the game together [Music] okay so uh there's three of us and you know we don't understand the company and with the equator is split three ways and we really want to have some skin in the game as well uh we think that 25 is a little more than we want to give away okay so um we would like to hear what the other sharks have to offer before we give an answer i'm out yeah so i have 300k for 25 percent [Music] that's less good yeah that's why i didn't say anything in your best interest when he had that offer but you you know you three musketeers dropped the fourth one for whatever reason [Music] so we want a counter structure counter so our counter is two hundred thousand for ten percent ouch you asked for two hundred thousand for eight percent we're nowhere in the same universe i'm out so i've listened to your cash flow which is quite impressive we're hustlers kevin we we're here to make a deal we want we were looking for a shark to help us you went up a whole two percent you're making a deal you you guys don't take anything out of the company because you're basically funding your inventory as you go and spending right facebook i would do this deal i'd give you 200k for 15 but i got to participate in distributions you got to start paying yourselves so our partners and i'm the smallest partner that will still take me three and a half years to get my money back it's not great i mean that's the problem so your offer is 200 000 for 15 yeah all right guys i'll make the same offer i got to tell you i don't really believe in essential i don't get it but i made an investment in a similar company ugly christmas letters they are doing exactly what you're doing they're doing a lifestyle brand online they were doing 600 000 we did 17 million last year i've learned that business inside out doesn't matter what i think about the product you guys are killing it [Music] i say they don't i say they do so what do you guys want to do [Music] robert we'll see if we'll accept your deal all right thanks guys awesome i didn't see it but the more you talked i got it i got it we are going to be the robber beats kevin again good luck guys thank you guys i really appreciate it oh yeah dude that was so perfect getting a deal with robert today is amazing because we really wanted a shark to help us with those high level decisions that we come across almost every single day and we really need them to take us to the next level [Applause] next into the tank is a company that believes two is better than one [Music] hi we are the clark family i'm monya i'm john i'm juju i'm lyla i'm aliana and this is tandem boogie we are from san clemente california and we're seeking 100 000 in exchange for 10 equity in our company our family has always loved going to the beach together but we wanted to catch waves on the same board so we created the tandem boogie on the tandem boogie every wave is a party wave take a look you can catch a wave with anyone whether you're a child going into the ocean for the very first time an adult that's been intimidated by the waves or a teenager that just wants to try something new the tandem boogie is for you you can surf it you can ride it front and back or side by side it takes two [Music] now that's family fun patent pending dynamic air design allows us to make a board this big fit into a bag that small you just show up at the beach you pump it up and then you've got a board with handles and a camera mount so you can capture all of the action and those memories that will last forever so sharks who wants to join our tandem boogie family and help us bring the fun to everyone now we want to ask robert if you'd like to come and actually try catching a wave hi all right sure let me try the pump as well yes we provide the pump as well so just grab onto the handles you can hold on to the ones like you're catching away if i had a if i had my little one he would be here or she yeah yeah and then i would hang on right yeah you can do um two people side by side too yes two people adults yep we go side by side we're side by side in the video as well it's super fun like it feels very solid wow so you guys are this great family i'm just curious like who's running the business what's the story well we all we each have a uh our function i'm in charge of uh manufacturing operations logistics um the website and i'm in charge of marketing and sales and social media and i'm the cfo which stands for chief fund officer i make sure that our brand stays in line with our vision and i'm the creative director i'm in charge of the merchandising i'm in charge of community outreach and then also making sure everybody gets the job done i'm the oldest sister i i just love your unity did you consciously design something that you could involve your daughters in we had as a family growing up in san clemente california we had participated in so many different water activities there's actually a picture of us all five of us on one stand-up paddle board um oh my gosh that is the cutest thing ever do you have a background in this yes um well john and i always said that whatever he can sell i can make i actually originally came here um to united states from iran as a refugee and um but by the time i was 21 i had my industrial engineering degree and was working in a big corporation um in manufacturing so i know how to make products and um john was always a salesperson so we decided when julia was uh six months we decided to start a business and what we started was a shelving business and it's been amazing because our main object for for having the company is to be able to spend time with our kids and and it's been a success we are still running it we um do about uh a million and a half in sales per year wow where do you manufacture it for the landed cost is a hundred and fifty 150 and you sell it for how much we sell it for 459. wow this idea of packaging it into something portable with the pump all in one fun kind of idea this is all you need throw in the back of your scooter your bike take it to the beach that's the selling proposition to me because there are other products like this but they are of the no they're not joy what is unique about our product we call it dynamic air design because the design is what we've perfected but has anybody else done this done this exact thing no so we designed the board and then we consulted with our attorney and we did file for a patent a utility patent on this design it has been submitted and that's for the whole design incorporating the handles the locations as well as the camera mount who goes out selling or is it only online how's the whole sales process work well it's been a bit different this year due to the pandemics so we had to pivot towards selling online and what we actually ended up doing was we launched a kickstarter campaign um as our first like way of selling so we did that for one month and we've done 43 000 in sales was that all on kickstarter 31 000 was from the kickstarter and that was um between june and july of this year yeah oh you're a brand new brand new brand which boogie board is 59 69 79 bucks depending on size under 100 for sure are you getting a lot of pushback on that price point that's a great question what what we found is that this is comparable to low-cost surfboards and because you can have two people on one board it's not like every person needs their own have you taken it to the surf shops and places where people rent have you tried that part of the sales come from the four retail stores that we've already got carrying our product what do you need the money for and what do you need a shark for well our plan is we do feel that the opportunity for tandem boogie is global and our plan is to grow our we would like to have 25 accounts set up this year so that we can reach over 300 000 in sales we think that's realistic but how are you going to get there your biggest challenge will be distribution that's it people will sell will buy the product if they see it based on my experience in sales and marketing i know how to set up dealers i know how to set up accounts i will contact them personally like we did but guys you can't sell enough just demoing the boards while you're going to get some retail distribution online will be where you make your most money you know you guys know tower paddleboard what made it work was the marketing ability the fact that that um stefan is just an expert at seo right that's what made it sell you've done this part but the part you don't have is that seo that sales skill right it's not that you can't figure out but you're not there yet and so for those reasons i'm out so we're sorry that you're out and we hope you reconsider appreciate it thanks well listen i love the name i think it's fabulous it's intuitive you know just what it is but i feel like with this product i think there's going to be better sharks up here for you so for that reason i'm out um we've had water sports products in here for over a decade and it's a tough grind to get this to be a five ten million dollar business and so i admire what you've done but i'm out let me let me tell you what i think have you watched shark tank for a while oh yeah yes do you remember a family that came out a dad with five sons called handboards yes yes that was my investment they were the california dream so it was a cross between a paddle board and a skateboard and i learned a lot with handboards but you have something they didn't right you have a patent i mean for me that's that's really key but i need a bigger chunk of the company because it was a lot of work so i'll give you 100 000 but i want well i don't want 10 john how much do i want well robert it is a tandem boogie concept two people right so are you interested in just going this alone as a solo shark or would you like to have a tandem boogie partner from the panel well there's only one other shark left it's daniel daniel what do you think i'll tell you my thoughts on this um i love you guys this is a sport that my family enjoys my wife loves the stuff my kids love this stuff i'm kind of the loser in the family that's bad at it um i have online expertise we sell over 100 million dollars online if robert would like me to come in on this to provide support i think we could do it for 25 for the two of us 25 isn't enough out and i'm just being completely sincere it is a lot of work and it's going to take a long time 100 000 for 35 percent daniel wants to come in as part of that happy to do it i'd comment on that if you guys would you be willing to meet in the middle at 30 percent no no you didn't come into the dolphin tank we want to stay on the shark tank let's go sell some tandem boogie boards let's huddle up we huddle up guys robert daniel you can join our tandem boogie family [Applause] congratulations guys well done guys congratulations thank you see you guys well robert and daniel are a perfect fit for our family they're both immigrants they came to this country as um as young kids just like i did and made the american dream come true and that's what we're hoping for what a fun family it's a fun business in the front where people see on the back it's kind of like the tech business it's hard you guys are in for a lot of work baby it's our first deal together daniel it's exciting it's exciting you ", "Back 9 Dips": "my name is david mealy and this is my wife dominique nikki for short we live in tampa florida with our son austin and we are expecting our little girl caroline in about two weeks nikki and i have been married for five years i met her my very first weekend here in florida where i landed a job with actually two of the largest golf companies in the country but soon after that the economy went in the tank so at that point my position was eliminated and i lost my job we knew we had to come up with something quickly something that would generate an income for us i always wanted to cook i wanted to be a chef actually before i got into the golf career so i decided to go after it to start our little barbecue catering company to try to make some ends meet we worked day and night everyone who tried our food loved it but there was one dish they kept asking for over and over again and we knew at that moment that we had a hit and it was kind of that light bulb so to speak we're like we we have something here now we really need the shark's help to bring our product to the masses once the sharks taste our signature dish they are going to love it and not be able to get enough of it [Applause] [Music] [Music] hi guys my name is david mealy and i'm nikki mealy and our company is back nine dips and this is caroline we're here today seeking 150 000 investment in exchange for a 15 equity stake in our company but before we go any further we're going to let you taste what our company is all about thank you thank you did you know that over super bowl weekend americans consumed over 1.25 billion chicken wings and the second most popular snack food that weekend was chips and dip well what you're currently tasting is an array of bak nines buffalo chicken dips we take all white meat chicken breasts your wing sauces dipping sauces blend them together creating everything you get in a chicken wing on a chip so this is basically a chicken slurpee it's a protein based dip you know i have to say it's delicious thank you you remember the basomatic you throw a bass in a blender you throw chicken in a blender i'm visualizing sticking that chicken into the blender mmm that's good chicken no different than your chicken being chopped up on your salad that you have for lunch we just grind it up a little bit and that's our number one ingredient are you crying for all the chickens alive when was the first time you stuck a chicken in a blender hey i married him for this dip so he's truly crying i'm thinking about all those chickens that lost their lives there's only two chicken breasts per tub [Laughter] i'm sorry man while they gather themselves it really is delicious thank you oh lord okay okay all right we're back now we're back all right now we shed some tears for the chickens tell me about your business after a life-changing event with me and david we went ahead and started a catering company called back nine bbq and while barbecue was my specialty we quickly became known for our dips so we decided to bring these dips to retail where we built a very loyal fan base from the college students all the way to the mr wonderfuls of the world what was the life-altering event well last time when i was eight months pregnant david he had lost his job and i didn't have a job so we did what a lot of people do and we downsize from a very large beautiful house to a very small house we have one car now we sold off a lot of things to make sure we kept the roof over our head but it's actually all worked out the best it really has been a blessing so now this is your livelihood this business it is tell us about the sales of it how much do you sell how much money did you make we're approaching 400 000 in in less than two years we're also approaching about 400 accounts right now we just landed our first supermarket a big chain down in in florida they gave us a 60 store test they gave us a number to hit a weekly number we're getting that going we're hitting that number daily wow our product the reason that it sells so well is because of the quality of the ingredients people will pay for a premium product and that's the biggest reason and it's it's pricey to put quality ingredients together for one it retails anywhere from 7.99 to 8.99 for a one pound tub and what are you making it for it costs us roughly 2.52 cents and i wholesale for 5.25 and how much do you have invested into the company we got about 150 000 invested that takes a lot of guts when your back's up against the wall to believe in it enough and we have a three-year-old son and then our daughter will be here in two weeks or sooner if kevin keeps laughing man you got a lot riding on this dip is it always a positive reaction to it do people ever look at and go ew i think i do think at first they'll take a sample they'll keep walking and then they turn around and they go wait a minute wait a minute what did i just eat because that was amazing and then when people find out a blended chicken don't have a problem with it they love it actually they give us really good feedback i think it's a really clever idea i agree with that i think it's wonderful i mean i really liked it i just really want to go take another one and have it over here i also love the two of you i think you're both great i really really want to help you but i'm just not sure that i'm the right person to help you get this into supermarkets everywhere i'm sorry i'm out guys i think you're gonna do wonderful things but i also know that to be a great entrepreneur you have to know what you're good at and know what you're not so good at and i'm not so good at food distribution of this sort so as much as i love what you guys are doing because it's not a fit and it doesn't play to my strengths i have to say i'm out i admire your just stick-to-itiveness to survive getting whacked from your job this is happening to millions of americans now it's a tough economy out there and then coming back with something that's actually working you're basically living off this but as an investment or a startup basically and so there's a huge amount of risk in it right now i could put a royalty on it and force you to pay me on every time you sell one but that's just cruel and justice to those chickens that have given up their lives in the first place but as an investment i'm sorry i'm out yeah i love the story i admire what you've done here's the good you know the product laurie likes it i think a lot of people like it here's the bad it's a brutal business you need a partner that can help you go down that road all i can offer you is is advice encouragement but i can't tell you when to zig or when to zag and i think that's what you really need today i wish you the best i know i appreciate that i appreciate that a lot this is a very very hard decision for me there's a guy came on the show last year named big chef shake i was in love with him and in love with the the concept but i didn't have enough knowledge of the business and then he went off and did 10 million in business and she looked for him damon you know i've been sitting here i really like you guys there's just something about you i would like to come back in [Music] four sharks are out but it seems that lori is having a change of heart [Music] damon you know i've been sitting here i really like you guys there's just something about you i would like to come back in [Music] would you go in with me what if we did 150 000 at 25 what do you say i think we can make something great happen i really do [Music] you know this is making it very hard and i'll tell you the main reason you know when i had nothing when i had nothing and then my little girl i had my little girl and then my wife was pregnant without a second and then ll gave me that shot and he said i'll just invest in you if anything happens just take care of me and when my little girl was born my second little girl i was a millionaire okay damon let's give him the shot it's okay lori i was gonna drop out this is a very tough decision because being as disciplined as i want to be as an investor i can't bring anything to them we'll figure it out together and we'll make it a big success look at the two of them and it's delicious come on damon lori i think that they're going to do without us and unfortunately i have to still be out well i think sometimes in life you just need a chance i'm happy to go in with you lori i think that there's people that just need a shot i can't add a lot of value today but i can certainly help you from a business perspective from where you've come to where you are today if nobody ever gave me a shot in life i wouldn't be sitting here and neither would lori i'm happy to go in good that's 75 000 apiece for 25 percent yes we won't let you down all right come here hug me i'm so hormonal good job thank you very much but you know what i will do my card will be there for you guys and them and anything i can do because i know you guys are going to make it okay i appreciate it you remind me of my my wife oh congratulations guys good job caroline she's going to come got some new friends everyone needs a chance everyone needs a chance i can't believe i cried you ", "MyoStorm": "[Applause] next into the tank is a remedy for aches and pains [Music] hey sharks my name is shaquille walker and i'm the rode 800 meter world record holder i'm jared ward 2016 olympic marathon runner for team usa and i'm jonatha perry and i'm an engineer i'm also the founder and ceo of our company milestorm and we are based in provo utah sharks when was the last time one of you woke up in pain with a sore back a kink in your neck or any other sore spots don't worry we'll fix you up in a second well actually it'll take several seconds but it will be quick and believe it or not we have all felt pain and experienced sore muscles 100 million americans report having chronic neck or back pain in the u.s alone 600 billion dollars are spent annually managing pain just like this as a professional athlete i experience pain every day i blew thousands of dollars on recovery equipment but nothing produced the results i needed i felt the same way as shaq we both knew there had to be a better way and that's why we invented the meteor the meteor is a patent pending fda compliant medical massage device that utilizes cutting-edge technology in vibration and heat therapy to help reduce pain and speed up muscular recovery the meteor is versatile and easy to use just use like any traditional roller combing the benefits of pressure from rolling out with the meteor's addition of heat and vibration you can use it while lying down or sitting in a chair or just holding it and applying pressure wherever is sore the meteor was designed with professional athletes in mind but it can be used by and benefit everyone who experiences pain so sharks whether you just finished running 26.2 miles or recovering from an injury or just slept weird the meteor can benefit you we are seeking 150 000 for 10 of our company so sharks who's ready to roll with us can we give samples good news we brought gifts for you i'm good okay all right here you go awesome red for you i'll go black take the box go ahead [Music] thank you thank you sir first of all we pick it up and it is this thing is hot i like the heat your meteors are already on and heated if i'm in bed i'll just put it on my neck and relax on it turn on the heat i like that matt it's yeah there you go there you go that's got to figure it out it's really cool i guess this is definitely good thank you thank you fire thank you it tells you it's huge that's smart so it's global thank you thank you so did you get the vibration yeah how's it feeling mr wonderful fantastic i use a roller okay awesome i hate the pain but it's it's the gain i go after yeah yeah so one of the things you'll notice what's nice about rolling with this is the vibration is designed to help mask a little bit of the paint so it's actually more comfortable than just using a traditional roller mark do you feel the heat oh yeah oh says it all says it all right there he's not afraid to get in there there's other balls out there so what differentiates you is the heat and vibrating aspects correct my background i was a mechanical engineering student and in my research i studied how vibration affects the human body we've learned that there's really specific frequencies and amplitudes that are more therapeutic to the body and we've just tried to optimize it and add the addition of heat kind of some background we started with a kickstarter last september we made a small production around a thousand units to fulfill to the kickstarter backers and learn if there was anything we needed to change any tweaks get feedback from a lot of our athletes what was your goal on kickstarter and how'd you do so our goal is 20 000 we did about 70 000. wow what do you guys sell these for and what does it cost you to make we've tested between 130 and 175 we're going to be selling them 160. that's expensive wow yeah but when you when you look into the space there's a lot of competitors that are selling inferior products less features that are heated and vibrate what's it cost you to make 40 landed so some of these products cost 600 and and then at the lower end obviously you have your 15 foam roller but this this really is a superior product at a more affordable price range and i mean consider how much you paid for your last massage guys i'm gonna just tell you the biggest differentiator right when you have a roller vibrating or otherwise you got to get on the floor yeah right or against a wall yeah and that just limits whereas here you know laying on bed you don't need to have a hard surface underneath just like you do with the roller so once again how many units have sold so we've sold total about 900 units so what are some what are your total sales so total sales with the kickstarter is about 120 000. that's not a lot i feel the 160 price point is a product that's tough because if your cost is 40 landed right why are you putting so much markup on it yeah why would you not get that yeah but that's never the right thing to disagree with so we have tested it with the small marketing dollars we've been using we've been running tests and see how the market responds have you tested this at 99. was it always over 100. no here's why that's right here's one thing that i would gather for sure if it was under a hundred dollars you'd do better it is always no mark don't even go there no there is always a price point freezing at 50 and at 100 and when you are under 50 you sell way better and when you're under a hundred you sell way better yeah and that is much more margin and they go to retail they know is your plan to go do you have a vision you're going to go direct to consumer as long as possible do you want to go to retail so the plan was to stay direct to consumer we are interested in retail we'd probably start with specialty you know here's why it works at a higher price and 169 is relatively high higher than i expected because the people who get this off the bat are already using other options right they're all re-educated they see the perceived value but because it's an electronics good and because you're an engineer you're going to continue to optimize it you might make it a little bit smaller because it fits low places you'll push the cost down right and once you get the cost down to 20 then you can come out with the ninety nine we already expect it to come down how far can you get the price so right now with our current manufacturers they say they can get it down to twenty seven at what volumes um ten thousand dollars which would allow you then to be under 100 for sure guys i love the product i'm tired of wasting time with all these guys right but wait dark i was about to make an offer that's why i'm going to larry really buying too much on this one right here listen guys here's here's what i'll do i'll give you 250k for 20 right so that gives you the capital you need obviously i can help you get it out there but if you if you want to hear all the options i don't want to waste my time i'll just take a nap so you guys let me know if you want me in for 250 for 20. just let me know if it's not i'll let you play with the math mark just let them bully you huh [Music] all sharks are still in and mark has an offer on the table for the heated vibrating massage ball company myostorm if you're if you want to hear all the options i don't want to waste my time i'll just take a shortlist so you guys let me know if you want me in for 250 for 20. just let me know if not i'll let you play with the masters mark would you want to partner up no i would like to make it i'd get them in anywhere we've got another offer over here guys i'd like to make it off maybe that's right over here man we love the offer we we will like to hear kevin's over but yes i'm out i like it i'll make you an offer i'm going to give you 150 000 for 5 equity half of what you thought you had to give away but i want to buck a ball until i get 500 000 back then that royalty goes away that's a good deal for you guys i'm interested as well okay i think it's a great product and i don't think there's anything like it i do have the ability to reach that same sports demographic through my role you know at the miami dolphins or a huge soccer tournament can reach anybody can reach anybody you're 16 000 instruments oh now i love it we're bragging about instagram followers wait i gotta pause on that all right so moving on i'm willing to give you uh you know 150 000 for 10 percent okay asking for it yep that's thanks very interesting however why give up that much equity that's crazy we love the offer i will get back to you once again all right i want to understand something do you have goals and do you aspire and can you we're negotiating a hundred dollars what are you moaning about it's no these guys have no motivation and they're lacking i'll give you the same offer as kevin okay we're gonna talk about it right here disgust yourself looks like what was kevin's offer a buck a ball back a ball until i get 500 000 back and i get five percent and you get five percent yeah i like that they get a fine-tuned athlete that's the thing yep okay all right well we've got an answer mr wonderful and matt we love your offers [Music] but laura you got a deal what happened they wanted you to feel what the hell that what happened it's like that guys guys why did you it was the same exact deal i was about to make you an offer value we think in some of the ideas that she has about lowering costs that's something that hey what if we do sell double or triple the units and that's something we can work on getting okay roll your asses out of here guys i'm really disappointed yeah exactly i'm gonna throw the ball at you now you ", "Doorbot": "first into the tank is a product to ensure you always know who's at your front door [Music] who's there it's jamie here

time you hear it'll be now who wants me first to ring my bell jamie what if you hit accept you hit accept then the light goes blue and then you can talk to them so your voice comes out of it your voice comes out of it it's got a microphone and speaker so it's two-way audio one-way video if someone came up and said hmm eyeball there can they just take it off because all burglars ring the doorbell first you know what though mark that's actually true burglars are not usually violent criminals they want to see if someone's home they want the opportunity to go into a house that's not that does not have people in it so it's actually true people do ring the doorbell it's very hard to remove and we also have offered that any customer that has one stolen we will replace it for free of charge and how much does each one of these units sell for 199 what are your costs to make it uh 81.83 is our cost landed in our uh warehouse in the united states and you sell it to retailers so far we've only sold direct on our own online store uh we are launching with our first retailer in november uh which is staples we launched nine months ago we've done uh an aggregate a million dollars in sales so far good for you and you've done a million dollars so far wow and the last month we've done 250 000 in sales our sales have grown month over month all online jamie all online all direct do you have any competitors currently we do not have any direct competitors when i say direct we're the first video doorbell built for the smartphone now there are other video doorbells out there that go to a panel it's not two-way so you don't have communication from that you can just see who's there competition costs the lowest price camera would be you know 50 to 100 up to thousands of dollars for so many systems but we're not trying to compete with the hundred thousand dollar systems that integrate cameras and everything in your home that's that that means a totally different market what we're trying to do is disrupt that market to give that to everybody the norm to give it to my wife who's at home who's in the bedroom with my five-year-old i'm away and at eight o'clock at night and it's dark out someone knocks on the door i like the product but are there bigger solutions that can come in and kind of push this out the door this category will exist i mean the doorbell will stay there it doesn't get trumped by technology i'm going to drive that there's a thousand different ways to alert what business is not going to get replaced by future technology but they're here it's about being able to be nimble and actually be part of that change i'm going gonna jump in here i think that you have potential to do a lot more with this but i'm not connecting to that this does enough at this time to distinguish itself is different from what else is out there on the market for the higher price point and so for that reason i'm up okay we're not comparing ourselves to a a cheap video doorbell that has a little tiny no one's arguing the quality of the product i like it i think you're going to do great with it but i've got to be able to say you know what when i jump in i've got to add enough value that this company still being worth 7 million could be worth 80 million 90 million i just don't see that progression and for that reason i'm out when i when i look at businesses i look at the three tiers that could hit luxury mid tier and lower tier obviously we understand the luxury market where we have the 20 and 30 thousand dollar systems and all that type of stuff that's not for that the mid tier is the adt's of the world that most likely will just add this to their services in some sense i i'm wrestling with where this goes in the market i just don't think it's for me i'm out personally i'm a security guy so the idea of having another access point on my house like that freaks me out a little bit because all those adt and all those other ones are hardwired i can't hack into those right so i think you've priced a lot of value into it but i think my real struggle with is it's really not an internet play it's a consumer device but you're pricing out 199 that that price point is going to start dropping quickly as your volumes go up for that reason that matters [Music] sorry about that don't send them to my house it's just it's just you and you now jamie let's take stock what's happened here you made a few jokes about mr wonderful the beginning and about the royalty structure am i gonna regret that mr wonderful [Music] four sharks are out kevin is jamie's last chance at a deal jamie let's take stock what's happened here you made a few jokes about mr wonderful the beginning and about the royalty structure am i going to regret that mr wonderful the only person left is mr wonderful i'll make you an offer i'll give you seven hundred thousand dollars i want a ten percent royalty that drops down to seven after i recoup the seven hundred thousand and i get five percent of the company's equity today you know we we have a vision i think to build a a big company out of this and i can't give someone 10 of all of our sales because it'll bleed us of cash while we really need it the most i'm basically providing you factoring capital you need my 700 000 for inventory but but respectfully i can raise that money through venture debt or line of credit or something else so then what's not the kind of why don't you counter me with a venture dead off so i would do seven hundred thousand dollars for a ten percent interest rate with a three percent equity kicker no not interested that doesn't it that doesn't it's not commensurate with the risk i'm taking honestly i do appreciate the offer but at the same time that money that you'd be taking on the royalty i need to reinvest back in this business what's the difference between the interest and the royalty the interest is cheaper the interest i can get rid of i can pay you back so you don't like the the royalty in perpetuity absolutely but i took the risk up front i believed in you the only shark i might add that did 700 000 is a lot of money it is a lot of money absolutely it's a lot of money okay jamie it's that moment when i say you're dead to me because you don't want to take my offer i made you a very valid offer i think under the circumstances respectfully mr wonderful we're going to decline go kick some ass jimmy thank you very much yeah good luck sharks kevin he was uh hi he was wavering there was a moment where he actually considered it i would have done that to you whatever happened to peeking through the window and saying go away mr wonderful gave us an offer for just royalties on the company and i don't believe you can build a big company having one person take 10 of the sales for life you ", "Handy Pan": "next in the tank is an innovation to a common kitchen tool hi sharks i'm adam and i'm josh we're from columbus ohio and we're the creators of the handypan we're here seeking a 10 000 investment for 20 equity in our company sharks everybody loves taco tuesday you know what nobody loves cleaning up the greasy disgusting mess that follows cooking with a frying pan we've all been there you try pinching the lid lose half your meat still end up with greasing your tacos or you do the spoon dance and you have to guess when your food is done straining or you have the messy exchange with a clunky colander that you still end up having to clean in the end that's where we come in introducing the handypan a pan when you want it a strainer when you need it with the simple push of a button boom the amazing handypan becomes a strainer too bacon no problem eating a little healthier boom perfect for your veggies and stir fries how about pasta night with the family sharks boom now you cook your meat sauce all in one pan cook your meat sauce in one pan wow that's really clever hey and the handy pot is perfect for your pastas what if you don't need to strain you're cooking something that doesn't require it no worries the patented design makes sure the strainer is always there if you need it but it's never in the way if you don't need it the handy pan is a must-have for anyone who cooks all right sharks let's get cooking without the grease of course and you'll notice some samples in front of you to try for yourselves if you'd like josh adam one of the hardest things you can do is get on this show thousands of people apply yes sir you did it and you're looking for ten thousand dollars that is correct that's a great question i'm glad you asked it took three years of effort to get on this show basically the valuation is that we wanted to come in here with a number that doesn't stand in the way of a deal and have you sold any so currently today after a small production run we've got 7 95 and 61 cents in sales really we understand with 7 900 in sales that we're not going to be able to ask for a million dollar valuation of course it doesn't stop anybody no you've been in business three years why so few sales great question the sales have been exclusively online and what i believe is this is a product that's ripe for retail how much does it cost 29.99 and what does it cost to make um it was 8.89 per unit landed we were at 11.43 but that was only based off 950 units it's highly demonstrable why do you think your sales are so low personally i think that people like this but it doesn't move the needle enough in that mainstream market to make someone a frying pan customer who's not already seven thousand dollars there's got to be a bigger reason i feel like you're not telling us let's just ask honestly what do you think you did wrong you know i think in hindsight i think that we could have promoted it better with our online videos advertising sales that's not an arena that either of us were in currently so i think we had some struggles there you're in what's your background i started out as a entry-level person in a office technologies company i ended up as the director of service for 10 years at that company and then i've transferred into real estate okay and you i am an attorney and i actually am a server and a bartender a few nights a week at a local restaurant and what does that say about your attorney skills yeah it says i need a break a few times a week uh criminal defense mostly perfect no i'm going to tell you why it's 7 955 bucks or whatever it is nobody cares this is not a product that's ever going to no are you kidding me well then how come there's no sales mark well let's ask the right question then right how much money have you spent on advertising for that amount of sales we spent 553 there you go right it's very very hard to sell direct to consumer online from your own website so the next question becomes did you try to sell these on amazon we did not oh well there there's a big mess but listen i'm going to completely disagree with kevin all right so i think that you probably just didn't have the right marketing savvy when you're cooking if you could just do this and drain out the grease eureka right you don't have to clean it the great part about the design and our patent is that it can fit on any size any size pad and you have a pen that covers all of this we have four packs design and utility on what you're holding we have design issued on pot and pending utility on pot so three of the four are issued the value of having an attorney partner right so listen we've got a great product guys it's a great product here's what doesn't make sense to me you're obviously bright guys right you're a lawyer but they get right they got day jobs their back's not against you but we've had over the 13 seasons we've had people here with three jobs no experience never knew how to do video never knew nothing about social but when they needed it and their back was up against the wall they made it happen you haven't done anything in three years because they got other jobs your back is not again is that yours wait you want to know something i don't even care about all this you ask for ten thousand dollars for twenty percent i'll give it to you i have nothing to lose done we're done absolutely good got a deal okay there you go [Applause] pleasure to meet all of you thank you very much congratulations guys good job check it out right why didn't you ask for 50 i don't want to be a greedy savage like you we came here lori was exactly who he wanted we thought we had a good valuation to just make it a no-brainer we actually sat on the deck of my house with my wife drawing this on a napkin and she first said you guys are idiots i don't even know what that is and this guy said you won't be calling us idiots when we have a deal with lori grenier you ", "Prepdeck": "next up is a way to stay organized in the kitchen [Music] [Music] [Applause] hi sharks my name's alexander eburn i live in los angeles california and i'm here today seeking a 750 000 investment in exchange for a 7.5 equity position in my company prep deck sharks we all know that cooking at home can be rewarding but the reality is most of us are no chef wonderful mealtimes can be stressful time consuming and really feel like a chore there's stuff everywhere as you're trying to prep measure and cook all in one go the right tool is never where you need it the food is burning on the stove and then there's the dreaded cleanup there has to be a better way oh my god well now there is meet prep deck the world's first all-in-one recipe preparation system loaded

prepping tools like a zester grater juicer peeler and more and they clip directly onto the containers so you can finally prep measure and store without making a mess the stylish exterior doubles as a large cutting board and it's detachable for easy cleaning there's a removable compartment for collecting your scraps and there's even a place for your phone or tablet so you can follow along your favorite recipes prep deck is on a mission to bring back the joy of cooking so which shark is ready to prep their checkbooks and get to cooking up some profits with prep deck each of you have a prep deck in front of you and some veggies please feel free to check it out i mean when i first looked at it i thought it was besides the name which is great it's intuitive prep deck but i thought that it might have been like you know for a taco bar actually the original idea for prep deck and the problem that i was experiencing was that when i cook i make a mess my wife christine would come behind me and clean up after me but when she was pregnant with our first daughter she didn't want to have anything to do with that so as i started to do all of these things myself you know right there in my kitchen i thought there was nothing to keep you organized while you cook alexander what does this sell for and how many have you sold the product retails for between 99. and 119 depending on the configurations i first launched the product through a crowdfunding campaign on indiegogo i had a 25 000 goal and we sold 350 000 during the campaign so take us your sales from there for the full year of 2019 we did one million dollars in revenue and in 2020 we did 6.2 million dollars in revenue in 2020 thank you very much and this year we'll do over 10 million dollars in revenue how do you generate those sales so 99 of our business is direct to consumer through our own website or through amazon what was your ad spend to generate that interest in 2020 we spent about 25 percent of our revenue acquiring customers you must be making a boatload of money what are your margins on each unit so the product costs us 31 we have a landed gross margin of 69 we had a net profit of 525 000 what would you use our money for so 250 000 is going to be allocated exclusively to inventory and an inventory buffer 250 000 is going to be used in ongoing product development and the other one third of the funds are going to be used to actually build a team we have a tiny tiny team right now but if we're going to get to 30 40 and 50 million dollars which i know for a fact we will i need some support i'm stunned that this thing is selling i'm a cook i'm a chopper i like wood yup ceramic all the textures that i cherish and love about the cooking experience it makes it all delicious for me i'm just not a plastic chopping type board girl okay i understand i'm out nothing tells the truth like sales and you've got them i'll give you a loan venture debt loan for 750 000 36 months nine and a half percent and i want five percent equity not seven and a half and i'll put my full you know chef wonderful behind this thing all right and my social media teams if you've been tracking chef wonderful i've got a pretty big business now yeah all right i've sell a lot of sous-vide i've got cheesecakes i've got a massive wine business gonna ship two million do you want to get on the carpet and start pitching us no but i mean i'm just looking at it saying does it fit into my world and it does alex i really like you i think you got those numbers that mr wonderful says i just this is not something that i understand enough so for those reasons i'm not all right good luck thank you for your time alex i'm kind of in the same boat the only thing i think is jeans is that you got these shot glasses in there so i thought that was awesome i just don't even know the competitive landscape so for those reasons i'm out thanks a lot ma appreciate your time i've been listening you know you have the same kind of trajectory i had years ago when i started with my very first product but for that kind of money and that small of a percentage i have to be excited about what's next well laurie i can assure you that the reason i didn't just go with a venture capital company is i don't want to sit in a room with a bunch of suits and be told how to run my business i want to work with someone who understands the path that i've gone on you have obviously been down that path and i think that this was going to be a 50 million business what do you think is going to make it that we haven't opened any extra markets yet we just d to see in the united states we're about to open canada we get asked all the time to take it to australia the uk germany japan you are really wonderful excuse me there's no quality associated with calling anybody wonderful 750 is just such a big ass for seven and a half percent if you have an offer in mind that you think would make you comfortable honestly i would want 25 i want to be the best shark i could be to you and sometimes that means saying i'm out all right well i appreciate it anyway thank you laurie all roads all roads laid back to mr wonderful in this case chef wonderful let's talk chef i think i made you very fair off so 750 000 36 months nine and a half percent interest are those interest only payments in the venture principle and interest it's a standard venture debt deal and five percent essentially warrants which is equity i mean i've heard from venture debt opportunities before and you know here's the difference here's a difference there are thousands of venture debt funds right there's only one chef wonderful and i'll probably accelerate your growth by about 15 to 20 i'm a big deal as a chef sorry it's true we're sorry too but listen you've got to pay for that it's not free i'm a shark alex you can counter you can reduce the equity i am going to count up with 36 months nine percent interest interest only payments so that we can actually use the capital without repaying the capital out of that original line for three percent no i wouldn't do that oh that's the right offer to make because it's the exact right except i'm not gonna take it look i like my original deal what i do for all of my food deals is reduce customer acquisition costs because i go back to the people who already bought my products from me right nobody sells like chef wonderful is there a structure where you can release the pressure on the loan repayment but alex it's not pressure look at you it is it's using it's using the initial loan money to pay back the loan it doesn't make sense no i can actually change your world by reducing your customer acquisition costs look you can take that deal and we'll be working together or you can turn around and walk out of the shark tank and that's okay too i respect your business i unfortunately kevin i'm disappointed but i need to decline i need to find the right deal and i completely appreciate that there's nothing wrong with that all right alex thank you guys kill it thank you very much great job here i appreciate it [Music] i've had sharks on my vision board for a long time it's a dream come true to be here and you know the response i got from the sharks and the confidence in them in them telling me to keep at it and that i'm enough to continue doing this alone is amazing i'll never

Hallo Haaie,\nmy naam is Christopher Gray, Ek is van Philadelphia,\nPA en my maatskappy is Scully. Ek is op soek na $ 40,\n000 vir 'n 15% van my maatskappy. Kollege is duur,\nEk weet ek is 'n student. Die koste van universiteitsrit is elke jaar en\nstudente en ouers word gedwing om studielenings aangaan om die\nWetsontwerp. Dit plaas baie studente in onoorkomelike skuld,\nmaar daar is 'n alternatief Beurs. Die enigste probleem is\nHierdie beurse is uiters belangrik moeilik om te vind. Dit veroorsaak miljoene\nvan dollars in gratis geld om na te gaan mors soos baie studente nie weet nie\nhierdie geld bestaan. Daarom het ek Scholarly geskep\nScully, Die mobiele app wat by studente pas\nmet honderde potensiaal Beurse. U voer eenvoudig 'n paar in\ninligting oor jouself, soos die staat waarin jy woon,\njou GPA, Ek is perswedstryd en daar het jy\nDit 'N Lys van beurs om in aanmerking te kom\ndit byna binne minute. So het ons soos Dolores-beurs,\nBank van die tenkhaai gebaseer Beurs. Mnr. Ronaldo staan\nBeurs $ 1000. Ek hou al van hom. Ons is lief vir\njy al. Goed jy suig regtig aan my.\nJy staan man. Ek kan nie. Wat kan ek s\u00ea?\nScully is nie net 'n besigheid nie, dis my passie. Ek wil studente soos ek help\nvind geld om na die kollege te gaan, hul droom. Bel\u00ea dus in\nvakkundig beteken dat jy ook kan Maak 'n paar drome waar. Laat ons dus\ndoen dit. Christopher 'n goeie idee. Jy is 100% korrek.\nDaar is soveel beurse. Dis 'n oerwoud. Ek weet nie hoe mense\nvind dit alles uit. Paar van Vrae. Is dit die werklike toepassing\ndat jy my gewys het dat dit die werklike toepassing. Die app is vir iPhone\nen Android, Ja. Hoe stel jy al die\nBeurse? Ek het eintlik databasis gebou\nen om studente te help met beurse vir 'n paar jaar nou\nen ek het daardie lys van beurse van verskillende webwerwe.\nDan voer ek dit met die hand in en basies sodra hulle in ons\nDatabasis ons hoef nie die\nverwerk nie meer nie. Doen jy dit deur jouself of het jy vennote? Twee medestigters,\nAlbei is app- en webontwikkelaars. Ek is D, ek is die besigheidsman,\ndie uitvoerende hoof. Hoe sou jy hiermee vorendag kom? Idee? So amper nou 'n junior,\nEk is 'n voorgraadse student aan Drex Universiteit. Ek het $1.3 miljoen in\nBeurse 1,3 miljoen. Ek is gefassineerd. Ja. Ek\nBeteken Dit is soos 'n lotery-oorwinning.

Ek het verskeie volle regte gekry Beurse. Ek het gekry wat die\ngrootste een. Die Bill Gates-beurs, hoeveel?\nWow. Dit is 'n volle rit na enige kollege jy wil gaan. Vertel my meer\noor jou dryfkrag om die Beurse. Ek het 'n enkelma gehad,\nlae inkomste ek en twee broers en susters moes werk\nregtig moeilik. Ek het wonderlike GPAI gehad behaal en ek kon eintlik nie\naansoek doen by sommige van die skool wat ek wou h\u00ea Om na te gaan as gevolg van die aansoek\nGelde. Ek dink ons kan almal vereenselwig met daardie storie. Ek is die eerste persoon in\nmy hele familie ooit om na toe te gaan Kollege. Ek kry die waarde. Wat jy\nnet gedoen het, was ongelooflik. So ook jy dink asof jy my kan kry 1.3\nmiljoen vir die opvoeding van hierdie bulbos die afgelope vyf jaar hier bo?\nSo eintlik met Scully, Elke student wat die app gebruik, is\ntussen 120 en 220 ge\u00ebwenaar Beurse van meer as $ 4\nMiljoen. So met om hulle toegang te gee om te wen\nal daardie geld. So met ander woorde, Jy sal nie\njy het di\u00e9 gevind wat institusionele neutraal. Hulle doen nie\ngee om waarheen jy gaan. Ja, golly, mense op groot dollars, ons is nie,\nOns is nie gefokus op instellings nie Beurse. So aan Damon. So Damon,\nU vraag is dat hulle ongeveer $ 100 is miljoen wat onopge\u00ebis word en\nbuite beurse, hoofsaaklik omdat studente nie weet nie\nhulle bestaan. OK, Christopher, hoe verdien ek geld hiermee?\nScully is dus 9/9 sent in die app Winkel. Ons het reeds 92 verkoop,\n000 toepassings. Hoeveel 92, 000 betaalde programme minder as 'n jaar en\nalmal met geen bemarking nie. So is dit regtig cool. Ons het 'n baie effektiewe\nPR-strategie vorentoe.

Ander Mense\nEk gaan iets doen wat ek nog nooit gedoen het nie voorheen gedoen. Ek het nog nie 'n hele gehoor nie\nBaie maar ek gaan jou 'n aanbod maak\nOp hierdie oomblik. Wonderlik.

Ek is nie\nprobeer om jou 'n moeilike tyd te gee. Ek is nie probeer om 'n moeilike tyd te kry nie. Ouens\nmoet net nie daarvan hou as jy opgeskep word nie.

Ja\nwant jy net. Probeer om die man te help,\ndan ons as jy werklik probeer help die man,\nwat ek wil doen, is om hom te vra Vrae. Hy het begin praat oor\n'n algoritme. Waarvan weet jy algoritmes?

Ons voel wonderlik. Ek dink hulle hou nie daarvan dat ons\ningespring het. Ek is jammer dat hulle was ontsteld, maar weet jy wat?\nDis suur druiwe. Wat ons gedoen het, was Groot. Ek is lief daarvoor. Volgende is 'n tegnologie om te maak\nhuisjag geriefliker. Hallo Haaie, my naam is. Junior en ek is van die groot D,\nDallas, TX. Ek is hier op soek na $ 500,\n000 in ruil vir 10% aandelebelang in my besigheidstoer. Soos u weet,\nom 'n huis te koop moet pret wees en Opwindende\nveral om saam met Barbara te toer. Maar vir die res van ons,\nnie soseer nie. Dit is tydrowend en Frustrerend. Stel jou voor jy ry\naf in die straat probeer soek daardie perfekte eiendom en jy sien\nEen. Wat nou? U kan 'n agent skakel en dae wag\nvir 'n afspraak, of nog erger, wag weke vir 'n oop huis.\nSou dit nie wonderlik wees as jy kon nie toer daardie eiendom net daar op\ndie plek? Wel, dankie aan my. Jy kan. Ek wil jou graag voorstel\nom die w\u00eareld se slimste slot te toer Boks. Toer is die eerste Slotkas wat\nstel kopers en verkopers in staat om toegang te verkry die Sluitkassie met of sonder 'n\nAgent. Barbara Ek weet jy het 'n paar deure oopgemaak in\njou loopbaan. Ek sal graag hulp wil h\u00ea. Bedank*******. Stel jou dus voor Barbara se\nry in die straat af en sy sien haar eiendom te koop. Sy trek dit\nop die toer-app. Sy dadelik stuur 'n versoek. Die verkoper keur dit goed\nhaar vertoning en onmiddellik Barbara kan deur die eiendom toer. So\nBarbara stap eenvoudig na die boks. Druk die aan / uit-knoppie totdat u sien\ndaardie kleurwiel. OUKEI\nDruk nou eenvoudig oop op die toepassing. Maklik genoeg. Nou is jy reg. Nou word die sluitkassie OK oopgemaak,\ngryp dus die sleutels na die eiendom op haar eie of met die makelaar. Nou as jy klaar is,\nsit die sleutels terug in die sluitkas, okey dokey en druk eenvoudig naby\ndie toepassing. Nou is jy reg. Gee dit 'n tweedens en dit sal dadelik toemaak.

So haaie,\nwatter een van julle wil aansluit ek maak hierdie deur oop vir\nGeleentheid Junior terwyl dit vars is in my gedagtes?\nWat gebeur as die persoon wat net gee die toer nie die\nsleutel maar sluit dit in elk geval? As daardie sleutel vir 'n stel verwyder word\ntydperk wat jy, die verkoper stel,\nu kry 'n kennisgewing as die sleutel word nie teruggesit nie. Maar as dit my\nHuis Ek is nie seker of ek iemand sou wou h\u00ea nie\nom ongesorteerd in te gaan. Goeie vraag. So die skoonheid van ons produk is jy\ndie verkoper, jy kan bepaal watter tipe\nwys jy wil in jou huis. So as jy 'n agent teenwoordig wil h\u00ea,\njy benodig bloot 'n agent teenwoordig. Dit is baie cool, want gewoonlik\njy moet wag, jy moet iemand vind,\nhulle moet 'n sleutel gaan haal by die kantoor, ensovoorts. Ja. Dus 00000 verkope. Want ons is splinternuut,\nmaar gelukkig moes ons jou dophou straf nou of nie later nie,\nLater. Wag, hoor my uit, hoor my uit. So gelukkig het ons 'n\nsuksesvolle Kickstarter-veldtog. Ons eintlik meer as 800 bokse verkoop\nmeer as $ 100,000. Ons het dus meer as $ 100, 000 in voorverkope. Hoeveel kos jy\nverkoop hulle vir? Die Slotkas self is dus 199. Wat\nkos dit u om hulle $ 50.00 te verdien? en toe 75 afgelewer by die\nKli\u00ebnt? Ek is baie nuuskierig wat jou\nagtergrond is. Ek is 'n vaste eiendom Makelaar. Jy klink soos 'n vaste eiendom.\nDit is seker. Ek het my eerste huis omgedraai toe ek 18 jaar oud was toe ek was\nop universiteit by Texas Tech, Ek was president van die vaste eiendom\nOrganisasie. Regtig. Hoekom is dit dat jy van regte hou?\nboedel soveel? Goeie vraag. So my ouers is\nuit Ha\u00efti. Hulle het hard gewerk om te sit ek in 'n baie mooi privaatskool.\nAl my beste vriende het in letterlik die mooiste Mark Cuban se\nBuurt om presies te wees. Vandat ek dit gesien het\ngroot huise, Ek het verlief geraak op vaste eiendom. OUKEI\nJunior verdedig jou 5 miljoen. Voor jou\ndaarby uitkom, laat ek my lippe afrol. 5\nMiljoen. Hoeveel geld het jy Bel\u00ea?\nEk gaan nie ophou nie. Ek weet nie Hoekom. Kevin\nEk is gereed. Ek is gereed. Ek vertel jy hoekom dit die moeite werd is $ 5,000,\n000. Hier is hoe ons geld verdien. Ons hef 'n moniteringsfooi hiervoor\nSluit bokse. Hoeveel kos die maandelikse $ 100 per maand?\nDis 'n flat. O sjoe, dis baie geld. Ag ouens,\nBarbara leer asseblief hierdie ouens oor hoe\nbaie makelaar Makelaars spandeer elke Maand. Tref my as baie geld. Kyk\nverlede Saterdag het ek 15 huise in 'n dag,\nelk met 'n elektroniese sluitkas aan Dit. Die agente het net hul foon vasgehou\nop. Dis dit. So hierdie toestelle bestaan reeds. So jy het een\ninkrementele verandering daarop, wat 'n koppelvlak is waar 'n gebruiker\nkan s\u00ea, ja, Ek sal mense inlaat as daar nie is nie\n'n agent daar. Dis die enigste ding wat jy doen dit is\nVerskillende. Gebruik hierdie produk letterlik verlede week,\njy moes op daardie agent wag om te laat jy in, nie waar nie?\nEn jy het So die enigste ding gehad wat jy anders is, is die koppelvlak van\nVerkopers. S\u00ea, gaan voort, maak dit oop, Chris. Dink. Goed\ndis 'n groot verskil, maar dit is nie noodwendig verdedigend nie.\nStel jou voor of jy vyf kon sien eiendomme op een dag op jou eie as\ngekant daarteen om jou agent te bel. Die agent bel die skoumaatskappy,\nDie skoumaatskappy noem die noteringsagent. Die noteringsagent\nbel die verkoper, Die verkoper bevestig dit. Hulle gaan terug\naan die noteringsagent. Die lys agent bel die skoumaatskappy. Die\nwys Maatskappy bevestig dan met die koopingenieur. Niemand haat dit nie\ntyd mors meer as ek, maar hoekom kan die maatskappy dit nie\nhet reeds massiewe markaandeel gedoen presies dit?\nAs jy kyk na die posbekle\u00ebrs in ons Bedryf. Hulle is oud, hulle is gedateer,\nhul tegnologie oud. Hulle het geen Platform. Hulle is so ontkoppel\nvan Makelaars. Vandag enigiemand in die vaste eiendom oortuig\nek wat iemand wat eintlik 'n 'n Slim Sluitkas wat deur\nBluetooth is oud en ontkoppel. Ek Beteken\ndit is soos 2 jaar oue tegnologie, maar daar is manier waarop ons platform meer is\nas net 'n Sluitkas. Letterlik die verifikasie deel van wat jy is\ndoen is die maklikste deel. So wat is,\nsou jy jou geheime sous s\u00ea? Ek weet nie of jy enige IP op het nie\ndit of ons doen. Wat is dit? Afgele\u00eb opening en sluiting. Toe nee\n'n mens anders kan dit doen. Wat? Korrek. Nee. Daardie tegnologie bestaan.\nNee nie op 'n Slotkas nie. Beslis nie.\nWaar het jy gesien? Absoluut grap. Daar is nie 'n\nenkele Sluitkassie daar buite wat kan naby op sy eie. Letterlik. Ek is\nbly jy hou daarvan. Ek weet dit net spasie en ek sit hier en kyk\nIemand vertel ons. Dat die stand van tegnologie is wat\nDit is. So wat Lock box kan sluit sy eie? Laat ek dus sien,\nKom ek kyk of ek die houvas kry. Laat ek kyk of ek dit kry en Chris is\nmet sy losskakel. Chris toe Chris na 15 huise gaan kyk het,\nHoe het jy daardie 15 geskeduleer? Ons het 'n agent gehad wat ons na die helfte van\nHulle. Ek het die helfte gesien. Nee dis nie wat ek gevra het nie. Dis nie\nwat ek gevra het. Hoe het jy beplan Hulle?\nJy het 'n plan gemaak om 15 huise te gaan sien in die ontwikkeling. Sommige van ons het gegroei\nop toe ons gedroom en ge\u00efnspireer het om koop 'n huis. Ons het gewelddadig bestuur\nmusiek uit. Luister, junior, Jy het die haaie wat stry oor\njou sakemodel. Nou gebeur ons om hierdie vaste eiendom hier te h\u00ea.\nGaan jy hierdie man $ 500 gee, 000? Dit is 'n moeilike oproep. Hy is heeltemal\nRegs. Dit beantwoord duidelik 'n behoefte en jy gaan niks kry nie\ninnovasie uit die ou ouens in die bedryf. Hulle sou\nhet dit lankal uitgevind. Hulle is aan die stuur slaap. Hulle wil nie h\u00ea nie\nom te verander omdat hulle die Mark. Tweedens\njy is waarskynlik een van die beste verkoopsmense wat ek al ooit in my\nLewe. Ek bedoel nie net ken jy jou goed nie,\njy het die toneelstuk gelyk gemaak veld met hierdie Pappa Warbucks by\nDie einde wakker die dra van die valse cowboy\nHemp. Luister. Ek hou daarvan as mense beter skep\nmuis lokvalle, en dit is 'n beter muizeval,\nNatuurlik vir jou aansoek. Maar my probleem\nhier is vandag net dat dit regtig is, regtig vroeg. So omdat jy nie\nnog gereed, Ek is uit. Baie dankie vir jou\nTyd. Ek waardeer dit Junior. Almal stem saam jy is 'n\nPuik verkoopsman. Die probleem is dus jy het dit geblaas deur 'n halwe\nmiljoen in die prototipe stadium. Dis te veel risiko. Egter\nEk wil graag in 'n verdomde bel\u00ea word goeie verkoopsman. Ek gaan hierdie ooreenkoms struktureer\nManier. Ek sal jou die $ 500 gee, 000 in twee komponente, 'n Hunsky $ 100,\n000, en ek kry die 10% ekwiteit daarvoor.\nDan leen ek jou $ 400, 000. Ek gaan jou 18% vra vir\nDat dit is wat u sou betaal in die\nMark. Wil jy dit graag neem Bied? Maak dit vir jou sin?\nEk wil graag die aanbod oorweeg. Jy moet 'n besluit neem. Een Haai is uit. Junior het een\naanbod op die tafel van Kevin, $ 500, 000 vir 'n belang van 10%, maar $ 400,\n000 daarvan as 'n lening teen 18% rente vir sy Smart Lock Box-maatskappytoer.\nWil jy daardie aanbod aanvaar? Maak dit vir jou sin?\nEk wil graag die aanbod oorweeg. Ek sou soos om van my ouens op die ou end te hoor\nHier. Junior Ek sal tyd bespaar. As ek die\neiendomsbesigheid, reg, Ek sal iets met jou doen. Ek\nsien net nie 'n pad waar ek kan nie s\u00ea ek kan jou help om van hier af te kom. Om te hoor, soveel as wat ek dit haat om dit te s\u00ea,\nEk is uit. Dankie, Mark. Dis \u2019n plesier. So, Junior Barbara, my skat,\nEk wil graag by Kevin aansluit op sy aanbod, maar ek moet 'n gebeurlikheid h\u00ea\nwant dit is geweldig ho\u00eb risiko. Dit is afhanklik dat ons dit kan verkoop\nna 'n reuse ketting om 'n ton te koop hierdie Sluitkassies. En ons sal albei\nhelp jou om dit te doen. Dis niks anders nie roep al die hoofde van hierdie firmas.\nAlles reg Laat jou toe om jou verkope te doen\nAanbieding. Jy is die beste verkoopsman wat ons al ooit ontmoet het. Ons sal net\nkry die deur oop. Ek het nog steeds nie het 'n kans gehad om uit te gaan,\nen jy is nie. Kom ons spaar die beste vir laaste. Wees versigtig, maatjie. Wees versigtig\nMaar wees versigtig. Maar ek dink. Jy het my getoets. Nee, kyk,\ndie heel beste produkte en die heel beste entrepreneurs is di\u00e9\nDie moeite werd om mee te stry, nie waar nie? Dit is wat gelei het tot die skepping van\ndie gras maatskappy. Soos die nr. Want dit beteken ons is albei\nemosioneel bel\u00ea in iets. Ons albei gee om hieroor. Ek is verskeur.\nJy is een van die grootstes verkoopspersone wat ek nog ooit gesien het. Maar dit\nis 'n idee wat ek dink soek Agtertoe. Kom ons wees eerlik. Sleutels is\nweggaan. Nie vandag nie Nie vandag nie. Maar hier is die ding. Ek\nwil nie 'n beter muizeval h\u00ea nie. Ek wil 'n beerval h\u00ea. Dit gaan wees\nongeveer 10/15/20 jaar. 'n Groot publiek Maatskappy ter waarde van miljarde dollars. Hierdie ouens hou van daardie korttermyn,\n2 jaar drie jaar junior skop sy heinie\nTerug veearts toe. So kyk, hier is die ding man,\nbewys my verkeerd. Laat my 10 keer betaal meer daarvoor volgende jaar. Maar vandag is ek\nUit. Dis hartseer om te hoor, Chris. Kevin, om jou as vennoot te h\u00ea,\nBarbara om 'n vennoot in die eiendomsbedryf natuurlik sou\nwees 'n no brainer. Hier is wat ek sou toonbank jou $ 250,\n000 vir 10% en $ 250, 000 kredietlyn. Kan ons in die? OK, ons sal 200 doen,\n000 vir die 10 persent, 300 laagtepunt. Deal. Goeie werk, ouens. Goeie werk, ouens,\nGoeie werk. En ek wil dit oor aandete bespreek\nVanaand. Dis brutaal daar binne,\nmaar ek is baie opgewonde oor my Vennote. Ek is gereed om aan die werk te spring.\nJy weet Jy maak 'n goeie punt. Dis ou tegnologie,\nmaar daar is 'n klomp ou tegnologie in Vaste eiendom omdat dit so slaperig is\nVallei. Ek het reeds die nuwe gesien tegnologie daar buite. Dis elke laaste daar\nWeek. Nee Dis nie waar nie. En dis\nAfgelewer. Nee dis vir hom afkraak, Chris,\nomdat die sleutel nie die sagteware is nie. Die sagteware is die maklikste deel. Nee\nsoos Markus, jy maak glad nie sin nie,\nMan. Ek sal heeltemal sin maak. Nee Jy gaan nie. Ons is nie waar nie. Hoe gaan dit\nhy bewus van daardie plek? Ek weet dit gaan oor jou kop.\nNee Dis nie. Dink jy mense ry\nin die straat af en huise soek? Hulle sien hul droomhuis,\nhulle sien dit te koop teken. Hulle is lief vir om in te kom. Jy doen dit nie en wat doen hulle dan?\nWat doen hulle? Die toestel bestaan vandag. Dit kom ons\njy wen deur Bluetooth op jou foon omstandighede. Indien nie daarin nie\nomstandighede met een nuwe lyn van Kode\ndit kan enigiemand inlaat. So in jou Voorbeeld\nEk ry verby en ek wil dit nou h\u00ea, Op hierdie oomblik. Jip,\nOp hierdie oomblik. Wie bel ek? So jy ping in die no look. Vir die bestaande Hou vas. Wag gou.\nPresies. Bly stil en luister. Moenie wees kwaad vir my dat ek dit verstaan\nbeter as jy. Ek bedoel, kyk, jy s\u00ea hy het 'n paar spesiale\nmanier om nee te kry en hulle is reeds voor hom. Hulle het\npresies dit. Om die agent te kry, moet\nstuur hierdie klein haaie blikkie stem nie saam nie. Kyk hoe kry enige agent\nin 'n huis saam met die ander Tegnologie. Hulle loop op, boeta,\nhulle is in die huis. So wat jy is s\u00ea is wat die agente doen,\njy kan die verbruiker in staat stel om doen, nie waar nie?\nEk dink ons is besig om in te haal. Behalwe as jy gebruik nie die agent nie,\njy wil nie die agent bel nie en jy wil dit so beskikbaar stel\ndat die sleutels net daar is en iemand wat gemaklik is met sleutels\nkan dit gebruik. Maar hy kan dit nie doen nie net omdat hulle 'n natuurlike\nVoordeel. Hoekom stem ons dan nie saam nie om nie saam te stem om 'n miljoen Lock te bedraad nie\nBokse die tradisionele Sluitkassies draad a\nmiljoen daarvan per jaar verkoop. En hoekom is die ander maatskappy het miljoene\nvan dollars se verkope reeds presies dit doen?\nAl wat hulle hoef te doen is om 'n bietjie om te draai en brei hul gehoor uit en hulle\nWen. Hoe verbind jy?\nSterkte ouens. Ek wens u geluk om jou geld terug te kry. Ek het 'n\nGeheim. Ons sal saamstem. Ons stem nie saam nie. Nee, jy het dit verkeerd,\nChris. Ek wonder soms hoe jy al daardie geld gemaak, Mark. My naam is Dave Asson. Ek is die\nstigter en uitvoerende hoof van Brightville. Ek is hier op soek na 'n belegging van $ 400,000. Vir 4% aandelebelang in my maatskappy,\nBrightwell is die mobiele toepassing vir kleuterskole,\ndagsorg en gesinne en ons is 'n vroeg heeltemal revolusioneer\nOnderwys. Nou glo ek ons almal is ouers hier. Ek wil vra,\nwanneer jy na 'n lang dag by die huis kom en jy vra jou kinders,\nWat het jy vandag op skool geleer? Klink dit bekend? Alles wat ek gedoen het en ek wil vertel\njy wil my vertel. Ek weet nie. Dit is die ervaring vir miljoene\nvan ouers regoor Amerika elke enkele dag en veral vir\njonger kinders. Jy was apart van jou klein mensie vir ses,\n810 uur per dag en dit is al wat jy Kry. Jy wil deel wees van hul\nDag. Jy wil byvoeg om te begin hardloop sodra jy by die huis kom en jy\nkan nie. Dis gut wrenching. En aan die ander kant,\nAan die skool se kant is dit nie beter nie. In toevoeging tot die werklike opvoeding van ons\nKinders. Onderwysers bestuur 'n klomp\npapierwerk. Laat ons eerlik wees, hulle bestuur eintlik ouers.\nEn boonop, hulle bedryf selfs 'n besigheid. Die\nstelsel is gebreek en Brightwheel is 'n oplossing. So kom ons spring in en\nkyk hoe Brightwheel werk. So met Brightwheel,\nonderwysers kan kinders maklik inboek vanaf die mobiele toepassing. Hulle kan aanmeld\nAktiwiteite en assesserings tydens die dag kan hulle vinnige opdaterings stuur,\nen hulle kan selfs hul besigheid alles op een plek. En ons is\nnet 'n ongelooflike hoeveelheid sien van foto's elke dag op\nHelderwiel. En dit is die rede jy vat dit. Jy merk dit en jy is absoluut\nklaar en nou gaan ons kyk na die onderwyser-app. Dit is dus die\nonderwyser se kamer en ons gaan klik op aktiwiteite onderaan\nhier en dit word alles gedoen op papier vandag en so het ons dit geneem\nen dit gekombineer en super gemaak Vinnig en super maklik. So ons gaan\nom hier op middagslapie te klik en dan is ons gaan merk drie kinders wat net\nhet afgegaan vir 'n middagslapie en die. Die sleutel oor Brightwheel is dat ons\nspaar onderwysers tyd. Jy eintlik Het meetbaar meer tyd saam met kinders\nelke liewe dag. En nou is ons gaan baie vinnig omdraai na die\nouer ervaring. Laat ons dus spring na die mobiele toepassing. Dit is eintlik my\ndogtertjie Serena, en dit is haar dag. En soos jy kan\nSien Ek kry 'n gevoel van nie net wat sy is nie\ndoen maar wat sy leer. En so as ek by die huis kom, kan ek eintlik\nvoer 'n gesprek met haar oor Dit. My verbintenis met my klein\nmeisie is soveel dieper as gevolg van regte wiel en terloops,\nin die middel van 'n taai dag, dit maak nie seer om 'n foto soos\nHierdie. Haaie. Dit is 'n unieke geleentheid om 'n massiewe te bou\nbesigheid wat 'n massiewe impak het op mense se alledaagse lewens en\ndis iets wat ons elke keer hoor Dag. So ek hoop jy sluit aan by Serena en\nons span en bring Brightville na elke kleuterskool, elke dagsorg,\nen elke gesin regoor die w\u00eareld. U verkoop my hierdie platform,\nhierdie paneelbord? Is dit wat gebeur?\nJa. Hoeveel betaal ek vir reg Nou? Jy betaal niks, reg?\nWiele. Bright Wheels gratis vandag. Wanneer ons ons premium produk het,\nU betaal 'n maandelikse fooi vir Dat. Die ouer sal betaal of ek sal\nBetaal. Jy sal betaal as die administrateur of die eienaar. En sal\ndie ouer ooit iets betaal? Nie vandag nie. Ons bou 'n platform.\nOns sien baie geleentheid om by te voeg waarde vir ouers langs die pad.\nBehalwe dat jy nie daarop kan adverteer nie Platform. Korrek. En ons het geen\nvoorneme om te adverteer. Wag. Jy kan aan u almal aan die ouers adverteer\nwil h\u00ea. Ons wil nie. Ons dink daar is 'n klomp maniere waarop jy kan\nhet jou tyd met daardie model. Nee Manier. Nee. En ons het. En ons het geen\nvoorneme om. So laat ek jou loop deur hoe Bright Wheels lyk.\nSo het ons in die herfs met 'n vlie\u00ebnier begin 2014. Hoeveel skole het jy gekry?\nJa. So het ons 10 skole in die Vlie\u00ebnier. Letterlik geen produk nie. En so\nOns het saam met hulle gewerk. Ons het geluister na Hulle. Ons het hulle behoeftes verstaan. In\nJunie vanjaar, ons het in die openbaar as Bright bekendgestel. Maar\nOns het van 10:00 af gegaan. En dan nou ons het 2500 skole. Op elke staat regoor die land.\nWow. So, hoe gaan jy geld verdien? Eerste\nEk wil dit net s\u00ea wanneer jy kyk na ander bedrywe,\nAl hierdie bedrywe het regtig wonderlike toegewyde sagteware wat is\nverskaf deur baie groot maatskappye. Dit is 'n massiewe mark wat\nhet dit nie. En so is dit wat ons onsself sien inpas. 'N\nbaie daarvan het te doen met die feit dat hulle nie geld het nie, want\nhulle is baie klein eienaars, maar hulle het maar hulle het begroting.\nHulle word net wanbestuur. Ek het 'n vierjarige 'n 2-jarige en 'n twee\nweek oud en ek trek my hare uit soms kyk hoe die\nkleuterskole word bestuur en dit is 'n besigheid, nie waar nie?\nEk het aangebied om sagteware vir my te skryf kinders kleuterskool en daarom is hulle\nhou daarvan, want ons haal dit alles af hul hande sodat hulle meer tyd het\nmet kinders. Jy doen so baie dinge tegelyk. Dit maak dit 'n\nbietjie moeiliker om dit op te stel. Ja dit mag wees waar die geleentheid\nleuens na regs. Jy doen iets vir skole,\niets vir ouers, iets vir onderwysers ook,\nRegs. Ons is in alles van vier persoon in tuisversorging s'n. Selfs baie mense is eintlik\ngebruik ons met kinderoppassers, so enkellopende persoon tot by\nelite ketting van kleuterskole. So ons is gaan die lae pryspunt bied\nongeveer $ 40 per maand vir 'n regtig klein in die huis dagsorg en dit\nskale tot $ 200.00 in terme van in terme van die topprys is 200. Dat\nkan 50 kinders wees, nie waar nie? Daar is 'n paar baie groot sentrums,\ninsluitend di\u00e9 waarin ons is, ons is in sentrums met verskeie\nhonderd kinders. Sodat dit is steeds 200 dollar. Ja\nJa. Het jy enige geld ingesamel van Beleggers? So gebaseer op die vlie\u00ebnier,\nons het saadronde van 2,2 miljoen ingesamel en $8.2 miljoen waardasie. Behalwe\nGeld wat wil jy h\u00ea moet die Haai\nDra hiertoe by tot jou onderneming? Groot uitdagings. Nou kyk ons na\nSkaal Ons wil 'n globale bou\nMerk. Ek is nie net hier vir geld nie, Ek is nie net hier vir PR nie. Ek is hier\nvir die vennootskap, moontlikhede om haaie aan te bring\nonder ons span en die waarde wat Voeg. Ons wil die handelsmerk wees van\nvroe\u00eb onderwys. Die probleem is die wet van klein getalle. Ek bedoel\nEk verstaan eintlik wat jy is doen en was in jou spasie,\nhet eintlik baie geld daarin gemaak, en ek dink dit is briljant. Ek veronderstel\njy het iets regtig gedoen interessant hier. Ek weet nie wat nie\nJou planne is in die monetisering. Dit is dus 1 000 000 volgende jaar, 6 000,\n000 die jaar daarna, en 20 daarna. Ek glo dit. OUKEI\nKyk Ek sal vir jou 'n aanbod maak. Ek sal gee\njy 400,000, maar ek wil 10% h\u00ea. Ek bring net ook\nBaie. Kevin, ek waardeer die aanbod,\nEk doen regtig. En die feit dat jy wil meer deel hiervan wees as\n'n Aantal van die kenners het ges\u00ea hoe kan. Ek verstaan dit is soos en kyk,\nselfs jou agtergrond, jy het 'n onderwysmaatskappy verkoop wat\nis waardevol. Waarvoor is uitdagend ek is ons beleggers het my rug gehad as 'n\nsoos ek U daarop vertrou. Maar hoe kan ek Kry. Ek dink jy gaan h\u00ea\ndieselfde frustrasie. Ek bedoel jy het geweet jy sal moet onderhandel,\nRegs? Ja. En ek wil iets vind\nwat werk, maar ek weet nie of ek jou kan h\u00ea nie.\nLuister, jy het Markus, jy het Chris regtig vaardig daarin\nSpasie. Jy het Kevin wat verstaan kinderopvoeding. Ek doen dit nie\ndink ek kan jou help. Ek is uit. Ek waardeer jou tyd. Doen regtig. Hoeveel skole gaan jy byvoeg\nhierdie maand? So voeg ons gemiddeld by,\nOns het gister 'n 38 gehad. Ons is gemiddeld ongeveer 40 tot 50 per dag. So\nGoed, kyk, Ek hou baie van hierdie besigheid. Ek waarsku\njy moet nie belowe soos ons nooit is nie gaan adverteer, ensovoorts,\nwant ek dink wel jy kan 'n baie waarde met aanbiedinge,\nkoepons. Mense in hierdie demografie wil eintlik h\u00ea dat goeie produkte moet wees\nsit voor hulle. En so dink ek Dit kan een prettige kanaal wees. Ek\nwil u 'n aanbod maak, maar ek sukkel om meer te betaal\nas wat iemand anders vir die Besigheid\nveral in ag genome wat ek bring met my agtergrond,\ndie waarde wat ek dink ek vir jou bring Platform. So ek wil graag vir jou die 400 K gee\njy soek, maar teen die waardasie van $ 8.2 miljoen van\ndie laaste ronde, ons sal jou die 400 K gee en ons is\naf na die resies. Kan ek eerstens vra,\nDit is 'n wonderlike aanbod. Het jy het enige begeerte om saam te werk met\nander Haaie? So as ek na die ander kyk\nhaaie en ek gaan hulle toelaat in my ooreenkoms,\nEk moet oortuig wees dat die stuk van die ooreenkoms wat ek oor het, is\ngaan gevolglik meer werd wees daarvan. En met jou maatskappy,\nEk is nie daarvan oortuig nie. As ons as ons T-hemde verkoop of wat ons nodig het\niets in die bed Bath and Beyond, Ek het mense tougestaan oor\nvertaal as julle verloorder is. Ek wil nie in die middel van\nEnigiets. Jy vertel my. Wat doen jy dink jy het nodig van die res van die\nre\u00ebl hier? Is jy ernstig? Is jy regtig so clueless? Nee\nEk is net ek is ernstig, is jy regtig so clueless? Een haai is uit. Dave het twee\naanbiedinge op die tafel vir sy vroe\u00eb Onderwys sagteware platform\nHelderwiel. Egter dinge het warm geword in die\ntenk nadat Dave voorgestel het haaie gaan in op 'n aanbod saam. Jy vertel my\nWat dink jy het jy nodig van die res van die lyn hier?\nIs jy ernstig? Is jy regtig so clueless?\nEk is net, ek is ernstig, is jy regtig so clueless?\nEk het jou nie hoor praat nie, Merk. Ek luister, nie waar nie?\nEk het jou 'n goeie aanbod gegee en ek was Selfvertroue. Ek hou vas. So as iemand\nanders wil nou 'n skoot h\u00ea, hulle moet. Chris\nEk neem die aanbod. Ek wil net weet of ons gaan saamwerk met\nEnigiemand. Jy neem die aanbod,\nso jy luister nie eers na Enigiets anders. Ek wil hom saam met Chris h\u00ea. Chris is\ngaan 'n klomp waarde daarop toevoeg. Om by die hangende vrae aan te sluit,\nJa. Waaruit het jy nog meer nodig? iemand anders?\nEn is iemand hier besig om te nomineer self bring iets na die\nTabel? Ek moet myself nomineer. Ek is\nluister, nie waar nie? Ek hoef Chris dus nie te oortuig van\nEnigiets. Ek het geen probleem met Chris en die waarde wat hy bring die\nander maatskappye wat hy het, net wanneer hy sy naam daaraan toeken\nhou baie St. cred in sy klein deel van die w\u00eareld. Sodra jy\nkom buite daardie borreltjie genoem Silicon Valley,\ndit beteken nie sover ek weet nie, as jy wil,\nAs jy 'n handelsmerkwaarde wil skep sodat iemand wat in\nTexas. In Florida en wil 'n\nekstra vlak van vertroue om te s\u00ea weet waardeur dit bekragtig is\niemand wat ons vertrou, iets wat ons weet. Het die rekord. Jou werk kry\nmakliker, maar dit lyk nie. Hou aan\nterwyl die twee punte van die tenk is twis soos hoenders,\nEk wil net iets uitwys. Die enigste haai wat nog ooit 'n\nmultimiljard dollar uitgang in jou ruimte is mnr. Dit is my\nSpasie. Ek weet presies hoe om te help jy, en ek dink eerlik,\nEk bring baie na die tafel daarop. Ek gaan nie met Chris baklei nie\noor of hy alleen moet wees of om nie betrokke te raak nie. Nou moet ek\nkompeteer met sy ooreenkoms, so ek is bereid om hom te pas, want\nEk het geen keuse nie. Ek hou van die ooreenkoms, Ek doen regtig. Die persentasies van die probleem,\nwant die skuifeldekstoele aan die Titanic,\n\u00f3f jy gaan dit maak \u00f3f jy is nie, reg?\nEn so of dit nou op 8.2 of 10 is Miljoen\ndis nie die probleem nie. Is jy oorweeg om dit oor te maak? Ja\nEk hou daarvan. So ek bedoel, hy het die meeste van die werk gedoen. Dis\ngaan daardie ander skole wees op die marge of daarin wees. Ons kom by\ngroepe of om te kan skep vertroue omdat die aansoek\ndoen die werk wat dit doen en dit werk Groot\nRegs. So wat skep die vertroue wat iemand net maak\ns\u00ea ja vir 'n besluit wanneer miskien hulle verstaan dit nie heeltemal nie.\nMiskien is hulle nie in die stuurhuis nie van hoe jy transaksies kry\nTans. Die grootste hekkie wat probeer oorsteek,\nDave, as jy hierdie ouens invra,\nIs jy bereid om meer prys te gee ekwiteit vir meer geld?\nEn dit is wat ek probeer uitvind uit sodat hulle selfs kan weet hoe om\nposisioneer hulself. Ek sou Dink daaraan dat ons hier ingekom het met 'n\nkonkrete vra in terme van 'n begroting. As dit beteken om meer haaie te kry en\nom meer mense aan tafel te h\u00ea, dan sou ek dit oorweeg. Ek sal dit doen\nhoe dit ook al sy. Ek dink om saam te werk met Chris is slim en natuurlik sien jy\ndie waarde daar en ek gee nie om nie doen dit. Jy mag nie dink nie\ndaar is waarde. Ek sal dit aan Hom\nof ek sal dit aan jou oorlaat en s\u00ea ek sal slaan jou #400K teen die prys wat jy\nhet teen 4% by die 10 miljoen dollar. Ja\nwant ek het genoeg vertroue dat ek genoeg waarde toevoeg dat dit sal\ndryf. So jy is bereid om die transaksie teen 400,000? Ongeag wat hy oor my ges\u00ea het,\nRegs Ek sien die waarde daar, want ek is\nSilicon Valley is sy eie klein W\u00eareld. Ja. Soos Uber werk in\nsy eie klein w\u00eareld en Twitter werk in sy eie klein w\u00eareldjie,\nen Instagram werk in sy eie klein w\u00eareldjie. Ek was nog nooit\nbuite San Francisco. Ek's jammer. So laat ek dan vra, Chris, jy weet,\nMerk Mark het net gevra of jy oop sal wees vir\nspan saam vir u ooreenkoms. Is dit iets waarvoor jy oop sou wees? Wat as ons dit by die waardasie doen\nwaaroor Markus gepraat het, 300 van Markus en 300 van Chris kry\ndit gedoen en wanneer ons hierdie ding bou Saam? Ons betaal meer as die laaste ouens\nBetaal betaal 25% meer op daardie tydstip\ngehad het nie. Ons het nie die produkte gehad nie,\nons het nie die handelsmerk gehad nie, Ons het nie hierdie span in plek gehad nie.\nJy het ook nie Shark Tank gehad nie. Moenie dit aan jouself doen nie. Ek sal 300 en 300 teen 9 teen 'n $9 doen\nmiljoen waardasie. Kom ons doen dit. Omhels dit, ouens, omhels dit. Jy stel 'n span op. Dankie ouens. Ek regtig, regtig,\nWaardeer dit regtig.

prom carmichael also from nashville tennessee the name of our company is minuscal we're seeking 500 000 for 20 of the business i am now 45 million americans go on a diet each year but the fact that 70 of adults are either obese or overweight means that something's not working we need more lettuce and fewer french fries that's easy to say harder to do and it's always a lot less fun that's where minus cow comes in a science-based snack bar and diet tablet that block fat when you eat it and how does my scalp block fat so imagine your digestive tract is a party and our ingredient the co-leave is the bouncer when the fat shows up at the party without an invitation co-leave escorts the fat out of the party and out of your system keeping you from absorbing those calories from fat it's that simple and coleave is not a sketchy chemical coleave is a proprietary all-natural blend coming from fermented tea that's our trade secret and we're able to put kohli in a variety of delicious foods minus cow is a great way to lose weight and to achieve better health so sharks who's ready to have your cake and eat it too with minuscule do we get samples i'm going to give them to you right now lori thank you thank you so much very welcome oh is this pill like in the matrix that's right one red one one blue red one blue if you take two of those pills before a meal it will help lowering cholesterol i've been taking the product for about 12 years doesn't taste great but what doesn't taste that great can you walk us through the co cold leave again and what is it you spoke about very fast sure sounds like that's the essence of your business yeah cole leaf is a is an all-natural ingredient that's derived from fresh green tea and what we do is it's a particular molecule the active ingredient in green tea we extract that and we increase the potency of that particular molecule by 20 times so explain to me explain to me actually the result it'll do two things it will help lower your cholesterol and we have a clinical trial that we did 12 years ago it lowers cholesterol 17 to 20 percent and then our chief science officer he went back and looked at the test results when he said the evidence shows that the people who took our product versus the placebo also lost weight and so we went to the university of kansas and they came back to us and said what your product does as it works through the lower intestines as it leaves the body it takes about 100 calories worth of fat is there anybody that should avoid this product or is it safe for everybody safe safe for anybody it's all natural that doesn't necessarily make it safe for everybody but at the same time look guys you know i'm a skeptic about all this stuff you can't claim that it's going to reduce 100 calories out of what you eat by taking two pills we don't make that claim that's what he said we are going to make the claim that is going to block fat at a percentage depending on our individual your t-shirts say minus cow that's cause that's the brand name of the company when a consumer looks at it what do you think he's going to think minus cal minus calories right what is your strategy what did you do mine is the strategy is to make you think that this is how we do this ask my question how long has this product been around we just launched so i assume you have very little sales is that right that's correct all right guys i'm standing you guys are dealing with people it's these questions you guys really they just invented this product out of nothing and gave it a name what's here it's my understanding trying to understand what i'm investing in marketing you're investing it's high fiber weight you have a bar it has natural things in it yours market's not mark let me just say this lark mark it's not air yes it is so you took green mark mark let me say this i have the data to back it up so if listen if you want to get out get out but but you're wrong no i'm not rock so listen you took you took uh green tea extract right and you invented a product called green tea extract that's what you said i said it's derived from green tea we take a particular molecule we increase that concentration by 20 times because that green tea molecule can lower your cholesterol by by 20 right everybody knows that everybody knows what so listen um i find mark's points potentially persuasive but in my philosophy the way i like to eat is ingredients you can see and pronounce real food and i feel nature over thousands of years has nurtured us in such ways that we can just eat the real stuff best of luck to you but i'm out here's where i'm at five hundred thousand dollars for twenty percent of a startup that has no revenue is way too high you asked for too much you made a strategic error i'm out i don't know about co-leave and i know that it's dangerous to claim that certain products will do miraculous things like not have fat stay in your body or whatever so i don't like to associate with those things i have no problem with you but i'm out look i i'm so frustrated i have no idea i really don't know what your business is i don't know what your strategy is i really don't know anything mark sometimes your level of arrogance really pisses me off and i mark it out let me and i only say that you don't give people a chance i wish i knew what their business was if you would let people talk you know what their product is robert your level of arrogance sometimes just surrounds the room and you're respectful to you robert i won't say what i'm thinking of people it intimidates people and i'm just telling you i have you might be a hundred percent right i just wish i had the opportunity to hear it i know how hard people work to get on that you know what's even harder you don't give them a chance i know it's even harder than them let me let me just say one thing please neither one of us claim that if you take this product you'll lose weight look at your shirt i said neither one of us said we would lose weight look at your shirt what what does your shirt say it says fewer calories right how do you lose weight wait wait may i please finish we're not claiming that you're going to lose weight we're saying that we are going to take some fat out of your body now i don't care what you say i know what my science says and you're wrong you're just plain wrong that that particular molecule that extract also will help you on your weight it won't make it will help you will help you lose weight but it won't make you lose weight actually krom now now you're pissing me off yeah yeah you're digging up and it's got nothing you're kind of losing you just said you're not you said you're not losing weight what does it say right here i i i will stand behind the fact that the goal is to did you no but yeah just to help people wait i know i i think we're done here to everybody who's watching don't buy it i'm out okay thank you gentlemen thank you go in peace thank you mark's never going to invest in a supplement millions of people take supplements it's like saying to a personal trainer who says i can help you lose weight and then you hire him and you don't lose any weight that it was a scam that's not exactly fair or logical you ", "Bala Bangles": "[Music] first into the tank is a stylish way to stay fit [Music] hi sharks my name is natalie holloway and this is my husband and co-founder max kislovitz we're from los angeles california and we're seeking 400 000 in exchange for 10 equity in our company sharks you remember the 80s aerobics were all the rage and who could forget the wacky fashion that came with it from headbands to leotards from leg warmers to you guessed it wrist and ankle weights mr wonderful i'm sure you remember it like it was just yesterday all right are you guys ready it's that time i know you're ready i'm gonna enjoy this oh yeah it's time to sweat i'm strong i'm strong i'm starting wrong nice i'm late for my meeting susan hold my calls nice great job guys great job let's take five and cool it off nice [Laughter] susan oh my gosh sharks i am sure we can agree that some trends were better left in the past but of all the changes over the last 40 years there's just one that stayed the same the sweaty loose sand filled wrist and ankle weight that is until now introducing bala bangles the world's first stylist wearable weights adding our weights to your workout will increase heart rate burn fat and build muscle so when you wiggle they'll be a little less jiggle whether you're channeling your inner yogi or training for that next marathon ball of bengals will make you sweat in style sharks who's ready to get sweaty we will now pass out some samples for you all to try and i'll show you how to put them on so what you're going to want to do velcro facing out and then you just roll down like this and roll up the first time you do it's a little tricky but then you're good as tight or loose as you want and thank you guys we can take it from here all right guys so our first product is the one pound wrist and ankle weight that you guys have bala is designed to be additive to a workout that is already exhausting these are gonna make it incrementally harder i know we're supposed to ask you questions but when was the last time that you worked out kevin oh shazam excuse me very important you may want to know this i got up at 4 30 this morning to work out but i appreciate the fact to be able to match my watch band to this red weight i like that i like the outside textures it looks spectacular you know what i really like about these i like the fact that you don't have to hold anything yeah and that's how it was designed actually i'm a certified yoga instructor so basically it's hands-free so i can do yoga all of my poses without having to pick up dumbbells put them down and i can literally do a whole class of yoga and get that extra oomph okay guys you're asking for 400 000 for 10 of the company correct that's correct so what are your sales so last year which were the first six months in business we did 260 000 wow and then this year so far we're at 1.2 million 1.2 million well in the year with 2.2 million wow we just placed pos with bloomingdale's nordstrom so we're 60 retail we're 30 amazon we're 10 direct to consumer through our website our blended margin is about 58.3 gross and we net about 49 having said that our biggest challenge and why we're here is we've been trapped in this vicious inventory cycle it's been difficult for us to keep the right level of product yeah inventory management is always a pain yeah what what is this retail at well landed we're 12 we can get that down wholesale we're 25 and retail over 49. good for you what are you gonna use the money for two key challenges the first is inventory which we spoke a little bit about uh the second is we're not out there proactively selling because we're just trying to keep up with the orders so we believe your capital will help us solve the inventory issue and then to bring in an external salesperson to essentially blitz the market so that nobody copies us but wait wait wait why bring in another partner right now i mean you're gonna make two million they need help to market this thing yeah if i were to make this investment how do you see me helping you besides you bring money a tremendous amount of credibility to the product to have you endorse this product you know there's no better so you know you would see me as a spokesperson for this project and you are literally like we looked at your instagram you're literally our ball of customer all right guys look i like it because it's got fantastic numbers i'm gonna go at it a different way you need capital for inventory it's a classic problem i'll give you the four hundred thousand dollars as debt for three years okay and i'm gonna charge you seven and a half percent interest on it i want five percent equity in the company for doing this you get the benefit of being in my ecosphere of shark tank companies and you get mr wonderful there's a lot of sports stars and sports owners and yada yada but there's only one mr wonderful sure thank you very much for that thank you well it's a start thank you very much you shouldn't give up too much equity given the ramp you've got let's hear the other offers i like this a lot i think it fits in my category very well i've actually been using the one and two pound weights for my shoulder recovery in the past year so i know all about it i like the look and feel of it i love your design i will make you an offer but i would like to bring in another shark with me i'll give you 200 000 if you can get another 200 from another shark but 10 is not enough for me no disrespect to anyone on this panel but i make a lot of money just being a spokesperson an endorser of a brand but i'm not going into this just as that there's a lot more hustle that i'll have to be delivering i would take thirty percent i would match that i would jump in the window i would match that as well i would i would match your fantasy maria i will do it with you 200 000 from me 200 for you for 30 go in with her you feel 30 is the right offer but i have the same proposals i can't split you into the stores all over we can all do that over maria you threw out an offer here and you said you wanted another shark you now have two sharks fighting to be your part what did you decide what are you gonna do would you be happy to go in with another shark [Music] i'm listening right because i think you have to be fair to them first and foremost we don't want to erode the value of the company below 3 million and we don't want to give up more than 25 unless two sharks were involved in which case we'd go up to 30 because we understand that you need a big enough piece of the pie to sort of make sense of the interest you are saying you'll part with 30 equity if two sharks are involved at a 3 million value you want 900 000 so each shark has to put up 450 000 to do your deal that's a big lift on your ass my friend it's huge i'm whispering over there mark you're not in on this yeah and don't try to throw me off i'll try it i'll show anybody under the bus maria is mark trying to woo you away from me i think is he is mark trying to woo you away mark wants to do it i'm sorry i don't like that i'm gonna make my own offer so my offer is five hundred thousand eighteen percent [Music] wait wait wait wait wait wait okay here's what here's what we like to do i agree with maria she can take this to the next level we haven't even discussed globally yeah and that's where really she distinguishes herself from anybody else on the panel right and because we both believe in it if you believe in the company you don't nickel and dime the cash down you you go all in and so what we'd like to do maria yes this okay let him take you what we like to do is offer you the 900 000 for the 30 just what you ask for [Music] you've got a deal done oh snake snake congratulations so much snakes in the grass thank you well i must say it's the first time in shark tank history i've actually seen sharks fight to be a partner what a snake no no no maria is the devious one don't put it on me maria is the devious one she gets all the credit i was fishing ah i can't believe it having maria mark is a dream come true having maria she's gonna blow this up tomorrow she is our baller girl we are so excited maria is an icon a global icon she's going to make bala explode you ", "Bug Bite Thing": "next into the tank is a simple solution for a common annoyance [Music] hello sharks my name is Kelly and I'm Ellen McAllister and we're from beautiful South Florida and our product sucks we mean it and

at least she has some items around the house to help her with the itching and swelling right wrong at this point she's desperate and starts scouring the internet from Mommy blogs and home remedies that tell her to do things like rub dryer sheets over her bites or even apply a hot spoon but none of these remedies are working either none of them are addressing what is causing her body to itch and swell huh in this case it's the mosquito saliva for other insects it can be their venom but what if I told you that I have a tool that can remove the insect saliva Venom from a biter sting so your body stops producing the reaction that is causing you to itch and swell I tell you get on with it I'm dying over here here use this bite thing oh that's neat what's it called bug bite thing yeah

going to tell us about that so like i said i i started this company last year with 500 500 that i only put into marketing and um we made 246 000 wow wow we are at 355 000 wow really what's your customer acquisition cost it's zero zero so you're doing you're doing three over 350 000 of sales this year so far with zero cost at this point zero requisition we're not spending any money on digital she's got a 200 000 followers that's excuse me it's not even the youtube channel we're we're always constantly going viral on instagram and tick tock like are you selling out of these hoodies yes and that's my biggest problem and that's also why i'm here like i want to make the deal so that i can buy more and stop being on pre-order so although you're a pre-order yeah the thing with pre-order is that it takes four to six weeks so you're making customers wait four to six weeks yes when we sell out i have to put the products on pre-order or else when you come to the site you can't buy anything so then i'm not making money how much money do you have in the bank right now i have 150 000 and how much do you have an inventory in inventory in inventory i got like 500 or less look i'm very impressed with what you've done there's no question about it but when i invest in an entrepreneur i want to use my following five six million followers and different platforms to help reduce their customer acquisition costs the only product category that i've ever had a problem with i've been successful in everything except hair care products and i can't understand why it just doesn't make sense to me so i'm out thank you so wonderful you are a poetry emotion uh a chaotic poetry motion i see in your presentation of your facts as well as i even think in your thinking which doesn't mean to say you aren't brilliant i think you're brilliant no doubt you are what i see often in business uh super creative the downside to super creatives is they have an idea a minute and then they act on it and i don't think you need a shark partner because you'd be too much to handle i spend all day long controlling you okay you need a working partner truly and you need someone who's exactly opposite someone who knows numbers someone who loves to live off to-do list okay i have to say i'm going to go out sadly but i think you have enormous potential thank you uh philadelphia i agree with barbara i always partnered with people who were anal and i gave up big chunks of my business because i'm a ready fire aim person and you seem to be a ready fire aim person as well and you need somebody who is like no you got to stay within the baseline change i'm here for it no you can't and that's not i'm not asking you to change i don't want you to change you're amazing the way you are but recognize one of the greatest skills an entrepreneur can have is knowing what they can't do and you need somebody there full-time that lives it as much as you do and that can't be me so for those reasons i'm out okay thank you you're welcome you still have two sharks left you do have two sharks left but i think the valuation is an issue and i think you've got a lot of kinks to try and figure out with this business you're gonna make a deal so listen i'm here to make a deal too i think what's really interesting and just understanding the landscape a bit more at the moment in retail is that all retailers are looking for black female founders and so i actually think that this product speaking to the audience that it does looking as diverse and inclusive as it really is has a huge window of opportunity

is the contraption so this is the brand new hammock Throne this is our high-end hanging solution that we've just introduced yeah I did so this one is somewhere in the neighborhood of 2200 yeah whoa wow but it's an indoor piece of furniture see that seems like a lot tell us a story of how you get started here our inspiration to start this was to literally end poverty in really vulnerable communities in the developing world the idea for the company started when I initially went on a backpacking trip across southeast Asia without me together in Boston at the time and I stumbled across a hammock on a remote island and I was immediately struck by how soft it was I was really impressed with the quality and I started asking some questions and learned that it was woven by this hill tribe Community it was part of an economic development program to help this hill tribe group out of poverty and I was really struck by that in Thailand so I went to this community and I got to meet the actual Weavers and hear their stories and I learned that this community that started making the hammocks with the help of an aid worker had been previously in debt slavery and the thing that really struck me was a lot of people kept coming to this community asking to join the program but they were being turned away because there weren't enough sales and I thought well we can start a little hammock company and you know provide enough jobs in this region so it came home with a backpack stuff full of hammocks and I came home to Rachel I was thrilled that my boyfriend wanted to quit his Finance job and start a hammock company as you can imagine yeah what are your sales this year we're going to hit 1.3 million wow last year we at 860 000 your sales are primarily online it's about 50 50 between a combination of direct to Consumer sales to our website as well as strategic Partnerships a big part of our early pulse kind of scatter shot patio stores we took a step back from that to focus on strategic Partnerships who uh it's virgin voyages which is virgin's new Cruise Line business so virgin voyages will be putting Yellow Leaf hammocks in every single balcony of every single cabin what price do you get from them for these they care wholesale price but they'll also be retailing them so they'll be on the room service menus in the in the cabin and on the stores the retail store is projected to more than double our current business so you've got to be profitable then right last year on uh 860 000 in Revenue our net income was a hundred ten thousand that's right they're paying yourself after paying ourselves yeah John Rachel yes here's my offer bam I wrote the five sharks here I probably have the most credentials about building social impactful businesses so I understand the challenges you're facing I really love a lot of what you stand for but you have a hundred thousand dollar profit with a crazy 5.7 million dollar evaluation so my offer is as follows and it's an explosive offer I want 33 of the company and I'll give you one million dollars wow say yes or no and then it's done all sharks are still in Rachel and Joe are seeking four hundred thousand dollars for a seven percent stake in their mission-based hammock company Yellow Leaf hammocks Daniel is interested and has made a staggering offer what what I want 33 percent of the company and I'll give you one million dollars say yes or no and then it's done billion dollars you you mentioned our profitability on last year I want to mention our profitability on this year yeah right and I think the order yeah so on the 1.3 million that we're doing uh this year we're doing 360 000 in profit one of the biggest things that we're looking to do with this money is we have a huge product roadmap of solutions Rachel so we started talking and take the deal he's paying you over eight yeah that's an amazing offer we also recognize that we might not need all of that money right now all right well hey well listen he just said maybe he doesn't need all that much money so I will give you an offer I'll go four hundred thousand for 20 now a granted his might be better offer for you a million dollars for the 25 and both of you I don't want to go to the million about 500 000 for 25 percent what's your counter for 25 600 000. 14 percent oh wow I love the idea and I think you guys are the real deal thank you I will give you the 400 000 for 15 percent if you take the million dollars from me you won't need to dilute yourselves again you know how much money kind has raised in its entire lifetime for the business the total we ever raised in our entire history was 5.2 million dollars we sell over a billion dollars in sales I'll teach you and I'll help you run the business in an efficient way are you okay with 33 or is that too much for you I think it's too much because the maximum that you're willing to do for someone that's going to really roll up their sleeves and help you we're looking at the future if you took 33 now I worry that we would it would hurt us at a subsequent round when we grow what subsequent wrong when I started my business started with one product I took out a bank loan it was about 325 000 I paid it back within a year and I never had to take a loan or bring in an investor again so listen I don't think you need to just sit there and take on all these investors and take in a whole ton of money you just need to be strategically smart and take in the right investor but you need something that's the bottom line so I'm going to change my offer I'm gonna go two hundred thousand dollars flat then I'm gonna give you a loan of 200 000 at seven percent I'm going to fund purchase orders if you need them and I'm going to ask for Seventeen percent are you making

I'm so thrilled thank you congrats ", "Hug Sleep": "first into the tank is a product to comfort and relieve stress hey sharks my name is matt munt and i'm angie cupper and we are hugsley we're a husband and wife team from milwaukee wisconsin and today we are seeking 150 000 in exchange for 10 of our company sharks like so many people out there we've got a real problem in the bedroom between his sleepwalking and my restless legs there's a whole lot of action and not enough sleep so that's why we invented sleep pod a first of its kind sleep solution designed to simulate the feeling of being hugged or cuddled sleep pod uses a specialized four-way stretch material that wraps around your entire body as this fabric stretches it wants to compress providing a gentle calming pressure helping you to relax and fall asleep now i know what you're thinking and you're right it's essentially an adult swaddle but sleep pod is so much more than that it's made from a breathable material that doesn't trap heat it's lightweight so it's easy to travel with and best of all it's machine washable and my favorite part is your significant other can't steal your covers but all seriousness sharks we spend a third of our lives sleeping yet so many of us struggle to get a good night's rest with hug sleep we can bring some magic back into the bedroom and get people sleeping like babies again so sharks who wants to jump in bed with us so i know 2020 has been a little bit of a stressful year to say the least and it looks like all of you guys could really use a good hug right now we would ask robert and we'd love to have you come up here and uh test out sleepovers to hug you no no no no there you go unless you really want a hug all right go ahead and have a seat on the side of the bed you're going to put it on just like you would a pair of pants so put both legs in both both legs yep and you're going to stay seated for this but go ahead and scooch back and swing your legs over onto the bed go ahead and get comfortable you may want to go back to your chest yeah yeah you can squeeze your butt stand up pull it yeah now robert start hopping so it's pretty snug that's it we don't advise to do that because we don't want you to fall oh it feels great i know you want to put your arms put my arms right so you actually want to lay down before you do that because i would hate to see you fall i'm an advanced sleeper there you go so now yeah you can lay down [Music] it's actually really soothing why is there a pocket yeah so we're going to tell you about that that's the newest addition a lot of people like to sleep with one foot out for temperature regulation oh that is a pocket so you can if you want but if you choose not to okay that definitely normally okay let's talk about acceptance in the market are we going to talk about rob's sitting there bleeding we're going to talk about that [Applause] get a lawyer before i bled to death it was very comfortable good good okay so guys sales so it's been about 16 months or so since we started selling lifetime sales to date are about 490 000 so in the last 12 months or so we've done 335 000 in top line sales on that we grossed about 215 and our net on that is about 140. why are we selling yeah so we sell direct to consumer through our website as well as amazon and what do you sell them for online and what does it cost you to make landed it typically sells for 99.99 and each sleep pod costs us on average about 22.50 to make but as we continue to scale we can get that down to about 18. so i just put it on it's warm it's very s uh silky soft feeling very snugly very stretchy absolutely so i think it'd be really helpful if we took a step back and kind of explained how this came to be so a few years ago i heard about weighted blankets like the rest of the world i ended up buying one of these weighted blankets and i tried it on and i loved it that initial pressure really brought on this sense of calm but i went to sleep later that night and very quickly i ran to the all too common list of complaints associated with weighted blankets one they trap heat like crazy and they just overheat next they're very difficult to wash you can't just take a 30 pound weighted blanket and throw it in your washing machine washing machine probably explode right i'm a mechanical engineer who's been able to work at some pretty cool companies so i'm no stranger to creating solutions to problem like okay maybe you don't use weight to create pressure but you use compression and this way it wraps around your entire body and really truly stimulates the feeling of being hugged and angie what's your background so i'm a therapist i have a master's degree in community psychology i specialize in the treatment of anxiety disorders for kids and adolescents so i knew more than a lot of people how important sleep is not just for our physical health but our mental health too so when he told me this idea i was already aware of deep touch pressure therapy not only for things like autism which is what it was originally designed for but for anxiety disorders for post-traumatic stress disorders deep touch pressure therapy is basically gentle but firm pressure applied to the body that triggers that relaxation in the body okay the question is here how much time and energy do you have to spend explaining the merits of the product to acquire the customer so our cost of acquisition has been phenomenal what is it eleven dollars and fifty cents blended wow and that's over the last six months uh and this is scaling i'm merely on facebook uh yeah so we're running ppc campaigns on facebook and instagram what did you do last month what did you do last month uh so last month was our highest revenue month ever we did 50 000 last month and were you profitable oh absolutely yeah okay so how much did you make in profits uh so our our net profit is usually about 41 of our top line sales so it was about 22 000 good for you that's awesome thank you so you're killing it and we did bootstrap this company with 2 dollars yeah yeah baby that's all you put in that is all we put in and we were profitable within the first week or two of selling i hope so everybody at home is hearing that all right what are you gonna use the 150 000 for so demand has been crazy um and we really need inventory i get it so um i like it i want to offer 150 000 for 20 well thank you for that thank you [Music] would you like to say yes so i don't want to drop valuation that much you can encounter what's your counter matt i'm intrigued also because of one why don't you let him answer he was about to say it may be better maybe my offer will just make demons evaporate that's why you don't have to worry about it just make you evaporate no i just look at it and say that you've know your customer acquisition cost i would just like to pour more money onto that very model the value i would add here is to drive that acquisition cost down i'll do the deal at 15 thank you thank you thank you for the offer are you gonna accept it wait a minute i'm gonna give you an offer whoa my offer would be 150 000 also for the 15 thank you thank you well and i guess there's something i want to make sure i put out there there are a lot of people suffering from anxiety sleeplessness we're not getting a lot of hugs and so this really is something that hugs you back even if you are alone i personally really benefit from the sleep pod because one of my my best memories from childhood was being tucked in um by my mom every night [Music] the reason i went into psychology is i lost my mom to suicide when i was 17. and through all of that pain i found a passion for helping other people and can help so many people i love helping kids i'm dedicated to helping kids but there are adults out there who need help too and this product can fit so many people and so many needs and so i i want to make sure that we make a deal with somebody who's just as passionate about this as we are you know i love it guys and i've got people in my household and my family that have sensory issues so that's why it's very close to me and so i'll make you an offer i'll give you a choice i'm going to give you two offers one will be just what you asked for 150 000 for 10 and the one i prefer is 300 000 for 20 so that way we're closer partners that i think we could really give you the same offer and the same choices wait a minute i'll match the same offer [Music] all sharks are still in and a bidding war is underway for angie and matt's therapeutic swaddle for adults hug sleep so guys you're going to get five offers i don't know how often that happens um not off no and look there's only one person up here who actually bled for you guys right here's my offer 300 000 for 20 that's my offer guys this is extraordinary uncharted what do you guys want to do [Music] uh well i think we certainly understand the value that all you sharks bring and you know if if any of you guys would be willing to kind of come together i think that's just going to continue to explode this company all right lori and i will do it together um the 300 for 20. well i think if you guys are teaming up and kicking us to the curb kevin damon will you come in because i think three sharks is better than two oh that's interesting i think so all right okay i'll come in with kevin and yeah three sharks first three sharks three hundred thousand for twenty percent yeah that's a tough one oh my god three's better than two this is a good problem to have very good problem to have i know we came in initially targeting mark and lori if you guys want to do a deal at 20 for 300 you got yourself a deal [Music] done i'm suing you for making me bleed i'm not gonna sleep at night now congratulations 2020 has been a scary time and i i think sleep pods can help a lot of people a little bit that we can do to just help people to feel safe and secure and less anxious and i'm so proud of you i'm proud of you that was incredible you ", "Peanut Butter Pump": "[Applause] next up is an entrepreneur who has solved a familiar problem [Music] it happened so fast one moment i was the family breadwinner the next i was unemployed and had to start over but i didn't get mad instead i got hungry so i went home and i made a sandwich and that's when i knew i could change the world the world of peanut butter my name is andy sharer i'm asking two hundred thousand dollars for fifteen percent of the company sharks peanut butter inspired me to become an inventor it's delicious it's nutritious and one bite of that sandwich took me back to my days as a kid in school a lot has changed since then but peanut butter hasn't changed at all it's just as hard to get out of the jar and just as messy when you do i decided it was high time to take peanut butter into the modern age so i created the peanut butter pump it makes peanut butter better now get ready because for the first time in history on national tv we're going to download a sandwich oh wow ah voila one downloaded sandwich that's cool now anyone can make a sandwich or a healthy snack quicker cleaner and easier than ever before you can easily measure it for your favorite cookie recipe and look how it cleans the sides of the jar so you don't have to i designed it to get every last bit of peanut butter from the jar people love this pump it's truly a game changer together we'll change the world the world of peanut butter there's good news here i am a peanut butter connoisseur wonderful and in my home i buy artisan peanut butters okay i've been known to make my own peanut butter i got a lot of questions okay number one when you get to the artisan peanut butters there's a lot of debate about how much chunk you have in the crunch factor oh my god how big will you let the chunks be before it clogs up the pump right now the inlet has a 10 millimeter all right i'll give you that now within the peanut butter community there's a raging debate or refrigeration after it's open okay do i put that giant stack in the refrigerator no do you keep peanut butter in the refrigerator oh yeah many many it's a huge debate in the community in the community because it gets too hard no no no no no no no no no no within the peanut butter community there's a massive debate because the oils separate at room temperature where do you find this community go online do you have a sample of it that's not in the jar well this this is uh that's what the poster is here prototype so let me tell you oh there's no sales yet let me tell you there are sales i i have plenty of pre-orders but let me tell you these are prototypes okay and it only works for stabilized peanut butter tell us about your history okay how you came up with the idea i was laid off from a job in financial services you worked at a bank currency exchange and i was laid off i decided to become an inventor how long ago was that that was two and a half years ago and then the peanut butter pump was born and then the crowdfunding campaign pre-sales the initial ask was twenty thousand and the the total sales now or 129. during the community thank you how much does it cost what do you sell it for the average price on the campaign was uh 27 is that a lot it's a lot let's focus on the task at hand the truth is 30 want chunky it's a raging debate in the community everybody knows that so i have to buy i have to buy two pumps to have both available and you won't let me refrigerate it to offset the rancidness kevin who is the leader of the peanut butter community the community has two debates all right no but who's the leader i am how do you know so much about this it only works for stabilize so for people who are stabilizing that means stabilized which includes extra wax which i'm against because it taints the pureness the virginal aspect we have peanut butter kevin we don't care so mr andy for peanut butter pump when are you telling your kickstarter contributors that you will deliver within the coming months i've already passed the um initial promise date but i've been up front and transparent but you need money to make them i do i need money so you took in the money and you already spent it i haven't spent all the money however i have withdrawn a little bit of money and i'm i'm that's not really what it's for but i mean i'll go ahead and do this even if i have to sell my house i mean i'm going i mean i'm going to make good on it that's that's really the whole point you have to got a question please damon i got a question please what what problem is it actually solving it's really the the classic last mile but for peanut butter i mean you have to take it out of the jar you have to scoop it you have to scrape the sides of the jar i mean some people get i'm out okay damon however you know 30 days a hundred thousand dollars in sales in 30 days you did 100 000 that's correct if you use peanut butter once a month you're not going to need a pump isn't this better use in a commercial because how do the commercial how do hotels whatever cases how do they buy they probably buy in huge tubs right this is for high volume users so families with children with school-aged children that's probably about 14 15 million households juice bars every fitness bar has a juice bar anybody really needs a pump to get their peanut butter out of a jar so i'm sorry but i don't think anybody needs a pump to get hand lotion out either and yet i think it's different andy i think this is i mean i think this is a very elegant design that you've come up with for a problem that i'm not sure it exists so i'm sorry i'm out so andy let's disclose the community now because they're watching you are not supporting the 40 of the community that wants to refrigerate after opening you know that they want refrigeration after opening because it's weird because it you can't put it that you're not supporting kevin i am so yes no true or false disclose now andy i am so sick of your peanut butter mark this is very important are you ever going to solve for the viscosity created by refrigerated peanuts i have told people not to put it in the refrigerator the real basic problem is two hundred thousand dollars for fifty percent is crazy there's no bigger advocate for the commodity than i am but this price is nuts like two hundred thousand fifty percent the whole business isn't worth two hundred thousand right now i wish you the best of luck but i'm out andy you're being a great sport right we're having a little bit of fun at your expense and you're going with it everything's factual mark don't insult the community anyways from an investment standpoint it's just not a fit for me so for those reasons i'm out good luck andy [Music] good luck good luck this is not the end of the peanut butter pump people love it and it will be me i think the sharks are a little bit out of touch and that's all there is to it it's a shame that they didn't go for it but somebody will you ", "Kawaii Lighting": "[Applause] [Music] [Applause] next up is a product to help you look your best online

ring lights like my makeup artist has a ring light and my sister has a ring light but like they're the only people that i know that have one and i've never thought about it with that i've recommended ring lights to everyone i know when i say you don't have a ring light and you're on zoom covet bursts the ring light it really did what's your mode of selling so we're selling direct to consumer on our website only and you are not on amazon is there a reason we've actually avoided amazon because we didn't want to create that competition by showing off and so we focused on making sure our customer service is the best that we can possibly be we made relationships with celebrities and influencers to make sure that our brand was the one that was supported by the people that were visible look what you've done is great right just starting and going to shenzhen and putting all the pieces together awesome brilliant thank you the reality though is this is a hard business there's always somebody over your shoulder trying to do the exact same thing so as an investor i don't see a direct path to scale so for those reasons i'm out thank you so much on what you've done thank you do you have a design patent on any of these no we actually do not have a design patent phase one of our business was let's prove the market are cute ring lights something that people would even care about so that was phase one and that's where we are now let me tell you uh something lon i love hearing that you know we hear entrepreneur after entrepreneur spending the money on a patent when they haven't even discovered if a single person wants to have any interest yeah they reverse it so it's so refreshing to hear that i'd like to offer you a hundred thousand dollars for 22 percent that's more money than you're asking for and i'd like to get barbara you know how shark tank works on the front end ten dollars a light what do you call that thing the ten dollars royalty a royalty a stupid royalty that he's always talking about but in this instance it makes sense ten dollars so i'm on the same page with you but i'm gonna overpay you a hundred thousand dollars for twenty two percent what do you say how long does that royalty go yeah it goes up just until i'm paid back so until you're retired she just gets her capital back and then she keeps the twenty two percent but i don't wanna sit around and just like be considered because i went over the price would you take my offer i'm leaving this up to you i think the 10 royalty is a lot right there's got to be a way where an investor recoups their money rather than waiting to the finish line five years out when you have a big company to sell and you know i'll tell you what just to keep interesting i'm going to make an offer barbecue i'm not finished yet do you want to hear my offer no i don't want to hear you off well i know you don't wait excuse me don't be so rude you want to hear another offer do you know why it's important just say yes okay great i'll tell you my offer i will do the deal barbara i'm sorry i have to finish my sentence at least okay just at least be a gentleman the reason the investor needs a means of of getting the money back is you always want them on the same page with you so when you have the success along the way they're having the success along the way and then when the big payday comes everybody celebrates and loves each other now you can talk the way i would do this is i actually like this idea and i think i could help you sell a lot of these i'll do 88 000 for 22 my royalties five dollars till i recoup my 88k the five dollar royalty also might be a little high i just want to make it a little bit easier for you and clear the field i think what you do is really cute but it's just that for me it's just cute and i don't think i'm the right investor to help you do what you really need to do so for that reason i'm out thank you emma thank you right lori what do you want to do i think it's cute i think you did a great job love you guys thank you i just have concern about um the marketplace and the competition so for those reasons i'm up thank you so much lori just to mess with mr wonderful i'm gonna drop the royalty to five dollars because i don't want to see him get this well i think the the the opportunity isn't barbara yes is that a yes yes great thank you today love it and i love you we love our lights too [Applause] thank you thank you for taking it and thank you all for your time we really appreciate you pleasure thank you so much [Music] oh my god that was experience of a lifetime honestly this moment means that our dreams and our hard work everything that we have just been putting everything into for over a year is really starting to realize i

you could lower inflammation increase fat loss strengthen your immune system sleep better reduce muscle soreness have more energy in just one minute well this isn't fiction this is reality and this is not a bathtub this is a cold plunge studies show that cold plunging increases norepinephrine levels two to three times their normal amount i don't know what that is either but apparently that's what leads to all those incredible benefits sharks all over the world cold exposure is exploding but buying 40 pounds of ice is a huge hassle our revolutionary cold plunge uses powerful cooling and filtration to give you cold crystal clear water whenever you want all in a beautiful sleek tub just set your temperature anywhere from 60 all the way down to 39. so sharks who's ready to take the plunge wow how about you robert you look like you could use the plunge i'll try it i'll try that's cool let's do it baby amazing what's the temperature set up it's five right now 55 that's not bad it's pretty cold 55 no i've done cold plungers like many times because we have one at the mavericks obviously why can't i fill up my tub with cold enough water cold out of the tap isn't going to be you know 55 maybe some times of the year if you're in a cold environment you can throw ice in it though that's what most people do right now they're buying ice and then it's like they have to drain it right after where our unit is always filtering it's always set it's always clean it's about if all right the key here is going to be anchoring to your breath your body is going to want to be really excited you're going to want to get out but you want to override that with slo just relax robert how long is he supposed to hold back the urge to jump out two minutes there he goes two minutes is

seriously like i feel no it wakes you up if you go like on it wakes you up ready to go let's go let's go so michael and ryan the big ice cube in the room is the 1.2 million for five percent and shoots a 24 million dollar valuation you better be selling a lot of them we just launched a year ago we were building out of his garage literally 12 months ago we sold our first unit to date we've done 4.9 million dollars in sales wow over the 12 months 4.9 year-to-date 4.5 and we're on pace this month through one point one walk us through the economics yeah thank you thank you what's it cost to make one and how much do you sell it for and how do you sell it so we sell them all on our website and so this plunge is 4 800 so it's very affordable our landed cost is 2 400 and that does include shipping do you have an installation service that's the amazing part of it it shows up they put it wherever you want it from there you have about 15 minutes of setup and that 15 minutes is mostly filling up with a hose the question is how big is your market right because what happens when somebody comes up with a good product you get all the pen up demand as people hear about it and they dive in right so you get this initial surge at a 24.5 million valuation and only having five percent you have to make 24 million dollars in distributable cash profits in order for us to get our money back right i have to think in terms not only can i get my money back but how much more money can i make in it and for you to come on here with that valuation i can't blame you i can i'll do the blaming okay so i like the deal because of the revenue but i also see lots of competitors that could knock you off i'll make you an offer i'll give you the 1.2 million for 18 equity but i have to get my money back somehow so i get 18 of the distributions you get the rest every time you take out a dollar i get 18 cents [Music] let me tell you what i think i agree with mark i think about like how many years is going to take me to get my money back i wish you the best of luck but i'm out so guys is more money better like is the 1.2 million when you've calculated what you really need or is it like if you got more money would it make life better would make things go faster so so 1.2 million gets us it's enough for 400 units that we can build what we want to do with the money is to really ramp up production okay i'm going to give you an offer i'll give you the 1.2 for 20 and it's going to be in the form of half a loan or line of credit whatever you prefer because i think that's your real need you just have cash flow problems and then the other 50 up front got it thank you i asked a question about cash because i wanted to see what you were doing with it if you have more cash do things go faster and it sounds like they do uh i'll give you 2.4 million 1.2 million for straight equity i want 15 for that and i'll give you the other 1.2 million as a straight up loan same rate you will get from the bank because i do think more money will make things go faster so that's my offer [Music] guys i'll simplify all that okay i'll offer you the 1.2 uh million 15 right i'll finance your purchase orders and it's just got to be first dollar back to me on the sale and so if you finance 100 units or 200 when you sell those i get paid back first right so it's just first dollar back got it so you guys you now have four offers what a lucky day for you guys what are you gonna do robert would you would you drop to ten percent i dropped to twelve percent [Music] mark ten percent [Music] robert we got a deal wow incredible 12 months ago we were in my garage building cold plunges and now here we are rob we have a deal with robert 2.4 million dollars it's incredible you ", "I Want To Draw a Cat For You!": "[Music] my name is Steve Gatlin and I live in Evanston Illinois I live a really normal life I'm a dad I'm a husband I love my family I work a 9-to-5 job building websites a lot of that's just sitting at a computer steering at code all day so I think it's important to fill your daily life with strangeness with exciting things I'm I'm an ideas guy I think of really cool interesting ideas a lot of my ideas come to me in the bathroom and I think that's that's the voice you really need to listen to so I have a product that on its surface seems really simple but there is absolutely nothing like this on the market anywhere right now the first time you see it you're going to roll your eyes you're going to think nobody needs this nobody wants this but you think about it for 2 minutes and you're going to buy one [Music] hello Barbara hello gentlemen my name is Steve Gatlin and my company is I want to draw a cat for you I'm seeking a $10,000 investment in exchange for 25% of my company little music maestro [Music] hey there sharks my name is Steve I got an offer that you won't believe for the low low price of just 10 grand you get a quarter of my company you understand you go to my site you describe a cat I draw it I mail it it's as easy as that I'd invest if I were you and I want to draw a cat for you I'll draw you a cat that's short and fat I'll draw you a cat with a pork pie hat I'll draw you a cat whatever the vibe I draw the cat that you describe [Music] I want to draw a cat for you I want to draw a cat for you I want to draw a cat for you I want to draw a cat for you well done love the dancing thank you that's my signature move Now by now I'm sure you're asking yourself how did this idiot make his way into the Shark Tank well let me tell you there is an economy for stupid and I am overflowing with it now with their Universal appeal my cat drawings are poised to be the next pet rock I charge people $9.95 for my cat drawings $932 of that is is profit I took the liberty of drawing some cats for each of you ones I thought you might order if you came to my website so Robert I know you're into fast cars thank you Steve Barbara you just close the deal and you're looking fabulous vroom vroom Mr Wonderful you are taking your morning uh bath and your tubo cash Damon here's a fancy man about the town and Mark congratulations on your Championship thank sir I have customers whove bought enough of these drawings to start their own cat drawing Gallery why are people buying them people ask for their dead pets they want to draw about their breakup or sometimes I have cats fighting an octopus and a T-Rex on the moon so they try to test you for like Bizarro stuff too yeah part of it is hey they know this is going to go up on the website they want to show off their crazy idea post all these drawings every single on the website yeah and then they share them with their friends and then their friends come and they purchase cat drawings to outdo one another um and there's some people who take this very seriously you draw these yourself I draw these myself I sit down at a table and I I take this person's very personal request uh let it play around in my head for about a minute and then I can knock one of these out in about 2 minutes how leverageable is that how many can you draw in a day I can draw about 25 of these in an hour uh in a week I can knock out about a thousand of these but that's just with me doing this by myself you know as this business grows because of the profit margin it starts to pay for its own growth so the really nice thing about this is I'm a web developer when I'm not drawing cats I'm building websites so I don't have that overhead that any other company would have what are your sales today okay I've sold over uh ,00 of these cats in what period of time this is about a year Steve what do you do with my $10,000 if I give it to you what I'd first like to do is build on my e-commerce platform that I have and grow it even further uh the other thing I want to do is start dabbling into things like greeting cards I love the stick I love the dancing Barbara was getting excited when you turned your behind so it's all very exciting but how does this go from $99,000 to 100,000 well here's the leap of faith working with me on this you're partnering with one of the most creative minds period I strike gold in very unpredictable ways what you guys bring to that is the business Acumen to take those ideas we have a fun little marriage there and I believe my ideas are billion dollar ideas problem every business model It's All About Steve nothing wrong with that but what happens if you're walking outside and a media crushes you into Road Pizza Steve you've convinced me you're a very creative guy but am I buying into Steve the creative guy and taking a leap of faith and saying let's go baby we'll figure out the business tomorrow or am I are you trying to sell me the cat business I'm trying to sell you the cat business and a partnership with me um I I have so many ideas which will seem at value equally as stupid as this it's obviously PR is the big push cuz you're not out there spending money to drive people to your website there are no cat drawing fairs or so tell me about the publicity um process so I'm a real Hustler for everything I do I tend to bring a lot of press attention to what I do on a local level I emailed Groupon I knew they had a cat mascot and I said hey I draw cats do you guys want to do a Groupon for this I got a response the next day and then uh you know on Black Friday we launched it and it was uh one of their most successful sold out very quickly um and how many did you commit to do well the nice thing about Groupon is a thousand people said I'm buying but only about half of them ever actually redeemed got to keep the money exactly look very interesting really small dollars not investable from my point of view can I tell you something Kevin you know let him go out just let I want you to go out and then I want you to go back to your hotel tonight put your head on your pillow I promise you the last thing that's going through your head before you go to sleep is I want to draw a cat for you I want to draw a cat for you I beg you please let me do this I'm out okay I I accept I accept it and I'd like to counter if I could so Steve you've done a phenomenal job of free PR but does it worry you that after all this PR that the net result is$ 7,000 I'm out these guys just don't get it I get it I love love your creativity I'll give you 25 grand for 33% just say yes 25 Grand 33% oh man cuz if you don't if you say no that means you don't really want to [Music] work I'm interested I'm interested hold on I'm the one that knows technology I'm the one who get dir trick he's done it before I'm not going to go in a bidden a cat guy Ste you got to make a call here no Mark I would love to partner with you on this I want to ask one thing what's that maybe one in a thousand cats will you pitch in and draw it for me yes you got a deal done what I love it you're hysterical thank you very much I'm very like hit it to the side turn right ready turn around that is ugly no it's not as good I love it thank you congratulations B we're going to do great we're going to make a lot of money can't wait to work with you thank you so much Mark I don't care how hard you look you cannot find talented people like that who have the vision and have the guts right the make a lot of money with him I love it it's hilarious to

My ma\nhet by Dunkin 'Donuts gewerk om te ondersteun Hom\nen ek is gebore. En toe gaan hulle terug na Suid-Korea vir 'n werk. Toe ek 14 was,\nEk het besluit om na die state te kom deur myself om aan 'n kosskool te studeer\nin Portland, OF. Ek het na Duke gegaan vir my voorgraadse,\nwaar ek dubbel hoofvak in ekonomie gehad het en Chinees. En my eerste werk uit\nkollege was 'n beleggingsbank.

En wat het geword met daardie maatskappy?\nSo ons het 'n paar jaar gelede 'n maatskappy verkoop. Na die verkoop van die maatskappy,\nEk het na Stanford Business School gegaan.

Ek sal graag wil wees omskep in meditasie omdat\ndie mense wat meditasie doen, lyk baie gelukkiger as die mense wat\nMoenie. Ek sou dus huiwerig wees om raak betrokke by 600,\n000. O skokkend.

Laat ek jou vertel wat ek Dink. Kom. My God, ek is hier weg. Ek bedoel, as die vertoning nie kan aangaan nie,\ndie vertoning kan nie uitgaan nie. Ek dink dit is so oneerbiedig om te s\u00ea net omdat\njy het 'n goeie werk gedoen om groot te maak geld wat jy nie verdien om te wees nie\nHier. Almal wat dit hier kan maak verdien om hier te wees. So welkom by\ndie Haaitenk. Wel, hou vas. Richard het u 300,000 vir 10% aangebied,\njy benodig 600,000. Ek sal jou 300 gee, 000 ook vir 10%. So jy het 600,\n000 as Richard saam met my sal inkom teen 20%, teen 20%, Daar gaan jy. Verskoon hierdie baie onbeskofte mense op\nhierdie paneel, wat ek natuurlik een gestraf het.\nOns sal die ander een uitsorteer in 'n Minuut. Die laaste ding wat iemand\nmoet skaam wees oor is goeie geld ingesamel het vir hul\nMaatskappy en ek dink hoe groter die oorlogskis\nJy het die kans is goed dat jy sal bereik\nmiljoene mense regoor die w\u00eareld en ek sal graag wil. As ek jou kan help om di\u00e9 te bereik\nmiljoene mense. Ek waardeer die aanbod baie,\nmaar ek het wel die verpligting om te bly billik teenoor sommige van die beleggers wat\nvroe\u00ebr in my bel\u00ea het en het op my gedobbel. Ek bedoel\njy moet saamstem dat daar 'n waarde om 'n haai te h\u00ea. So dink ek\nsoos Markus ges\u00ea het, ons is nie ek nie, Ek voel nie verplig om aan te bied by\ndieselfde waarde as die ander beleggers het,\nmet alle respek aan hulle, maak ons 'n toonbank.

Ek is mal oor jou dryfkrag daarmee. Dis\nnatuurlik diep persoonlik daaraan. Jou toonbank is ongeveer 6%. Ek kannie\nkom daar. Ek bedoel Ek sal daal tot 15%. Ek sal graag wil wees\ndaarby betrokke. Ek wil nie praat vir Richard. Ek is baie bly om\ndoen dit op daardie basis. Jy het die Wys. Daar is geweldige waarde van\nhier aan te wees. Ek dink eintlik Dis wat sy ges\u00ea het. Ek eintlik\ndink daar is 'n waardetoevoeging tot jou beleggers wat jy dalk nie is nie\nin berekening bring. U het die sigbaarheid waardeer,\njy waardeer die verhoogde bemarkbaarheid en die waarde vir jou\nProduk maar jy het ons regtig nie waardeer nie. Ek en ek kry my posisie dat\nDie drie maande van yo-yo bro gelukkig. Ons doen graag 15% As jy wil\ndit was opgewonde. Ek sal graag wil wees daarby betrokke. Ek kan net nie 15% doen nie.

", "Hopsotch": "[Applause] next up is a business hoping to inspire budding tech savvy entrepreneurs [Music] hi sharks my name is Samantha John I'm here from Brooklyn New York seeking four hundred thousand dollars for four percent equity in my company Hopscotch back in the day when you were little sharks did you ever run a lemonade stand or mow your neighbor's lawn kids love running businesses because it's a way to make their own money and participate in the real world but in today's digital economy lemonade stands are a thing of the past that's why I created Hopscotch it's the best way for young entrepreneurs to build and run their first business on the internet all from their mobile device they use the kid-friendly programming language I invented to make incredible games that rival anything you see in the store and that's not all shark by selling those games to the hundreds of thousands of children in our community they can turn their Creations into real currency and the best part they're learning real coding skills that will be valuable Tools in their future college classes and even careers through our fun educational app parents will be blown away with what their kids can make they'll learn Concepts from game design to Graphics animation and so much more so sharks you've all talked to kids about how they are the entrepreneurs of the future here's your chance to put your money where your mouth is which one of you wants to Hopscotch with me into the digital age your last name is John my last name is John I feel and you were an affinity from Brooklyn yeah we we might we might be family I might have to call my mommy so in front of you you have an iPad and I've chosen two of my favorite Hopscotch games in a demo version of hopscotch for you to try you to pick the ones I did that I've posted all at the Hopscotch with my daughters oh so the first game I want you to try is called Kaleida Cosmos and it's a drawing game where uh everything you draw will be repeated eight times so you make this really cool kaleidoscope drawing and this game was made five years ago in Hopscotch it's since received over 2.2 million plays heck it's a lot of fun to do isn't it yeah can I see your drawing well I'm not sure I'm so proud of it but there it is oh I love it oh I like that that's like a logo oh Kevin I like that boring yes we call it man's inhumanity against man Damon what you got that is really cool it kind of looks 3D oh damned yeah the second game is a platformer game and that was created more recently in Hopscotch this game was made by a kid who has been on Hopscotch for over four years I got up to the first level oh my god well I'm not winning this game that's just this is Child's Play literally ah I'm so ill with mine I actually want to show you guys a demo of how the coding in Hopscotch works so you can just get a sense of it so this is the coding editor and you're coding with these cool characters I'm just going to show you walk you through making this game where the crocodile is gonna go after the octopus and then it's gonna eat it um and then you can do it's just a little bit more code you can start to see how this turns into a game so now the crocodile has all these other people and it's getting bigger as it eats more it's pretty cute thank you Samantha tell us about you how did you come up with this you know when I was a kid I never thought that coding was for me I was like computers those are for boys and it wasn't until my senior year of college I took my first computer science class and it was it was so empowering it was so creative and I was like why didn't I know that programming was so fun and creative and interesting and I could make things that people actually care about so Hopscotch actually launched in 2012. and at that time it was all free and our first week we got 20 000 downloads so we got a lot of press you guys are on top of the world you were dominating for kids programming languages there was no Revenue at that time you just no Revenue no Revenue model we are first-time entrepreneurs we were like grow grow honestly guys like when you comes to kids in school there's some other Alternatives but Hopscotch is the go-to name they crush it right and by the way when I said I used it and put and posted an app I meant it right I've yeah I use scratch and then when my kids first got into it at school we used Hopscotch and developed game it's intriguing how do I make money so we have a currency that you can buy in Hopscotch from the app store and then you can you'll be able to use that currency inside another kids game so that'll be the revenue you'll keep the two-thirds of the revenue from the app you'll sell yes and then eventually we want to let kids share in the revenue as well so we would do eventually let kids cash out that they earn in their game what's the active user base our active user base now is about 200 000 active users a month what was your Peak our Peak was in 2015 I believe and we were at about 400 000. so what happened is we raised our first round of venture capital in 2013 after we launched the app and then we raised our second round in 2015. and then we saw the trajectory on where it was all about growth and we were going to have to continue raising capital and we didn't want to run the risk of just going out of business if we couldn't raise money so we started switching to a subscription model so we are profitable now how many subscribers do you have uh we have about 6 200 subscribers right now what's the cost per month uh the Hopscotch costs eight dollars per month or eighty dollars per year how profitable are you now so we're basically not really burning cash not really making cash but that's kind of a decision to have a team you're breaking news and that's kind of why I'm coming to you Charlotte we have the subscription business and it keeps us in business but it's not really the right business model for Hopscotch we want a little bit more Capital so that we can start getting rid of that paywall letting everyone in for free and playing a long game where they can start buying into it and you hope that gets traction because by taking down the subscription paywall you give up that Revenue stream in perpetuity I'm not really crazy about your business model of giving up what you've worked very hard to achieve a subscription you know six thousand people paying you every month is a good business it looks like you want to scale but I just don't think it's figured out yet and uh it's a little dangerous for me so I'm out I really love what you're doing thank you I personally don't know how I would help you to blow this up as a business so I'm going to say I'm out uh Samantha I'm I'm not going to take a journey with you I've I've been in your sector and spent many many years of my career in it and I swore that when I left and I exited that that was it for me that I would try other things I'm out what I see here is uh you are a tremendously Brave young woman you reinvented your business from what I'm counting here roughly three times you're going into another new model how sure are you that your new model is going to work I don't believe that you are sure I feel like I'm watching someone who's frightened and not quite sure which is the right way to go am I reading that right um it's not that I'm not sure I'm sure that this is the right way to go of course I'm frightened I naturally am a very conservative person I'm like no like don't spend the money hang on to everything I don't call that conservative I call that smart thank you uh but I also realize that to make Hopscotch what it needs to be we do need to take this step you should trust you got I'm sure you're going to do that I wish I could give you the 400 000. just because I believe in you but I don't know enough about it so sadly I'm out [Music] so first I want to ask you a question can a kid do this on a lower end iPhone yes okay so honestly I mean I've been a hopscotch fan forever I mean just talking to you like I look up to you for what you have what you've been able to accomplish and what you've been able to do for my daughters and my son I mean thank you doing these games with them was thrilling to me that's awesome so I'll make you an offer you're not gonna like it four sharks are out Mark is Samantha's last chance for a deal for her kids coding app and Marketplace Hopscotch so my Foundation Mark Cuban Foundation we do something called the AI boot camp and we want to introduce kids to high school kids primarily in minority communities because they don't get the chance right I could work with you to do a coding camp for kids how to make money with your phone right how to create games to make money yes and go in even if we have to provide them so I'll give you the four hundred thousand dollars but I want 16 16 yeah and I'll tell you why because this is a lot of work and I'm going to be that person you call or email mark I would love to have you be one of our investors can I negotiate with you on the price Mark you know if you're valuing this as a startup it's like a startup with an experienced entrepreneur with eight years of experience building programming languages for kids who's proven that she can get earned media who's proven that she knows how to run a profitable business she's proven she knows how to earn 35 000 in Revenue per month after eight years and I'm not trying to take anything away from you at all obviously I'm incredibly impressed but the future of your company is truly in the balance right now you know you know Hot Scotch is my baby I need to value my company for all the amazing assets that I have so okay so only because I'm a softy okay what would you do knowing that I don't want to come off the 16 what would you do so how about uh six hundred thousand for five percent I'm out oh [Music] ouch I'll give you one more chance [Music] we're not close you've got at least yeah we're not close I think that maybe it might just be that the way I value Hopscotch just isn't quite there's no way in the world you thought you were coming in here and getting four percent and if five percent is your end then you really did not want to deal but yeah I was gonna say 600 000 for ten percent for 11 you got a deal how about [Music] you don't over negotiate I can't believe I got a deal oh my God [Applause] oh my gosh ", "Muvez": "first into the tank is a new concept in footwear [Music] hey sharks my name is ryan this is my brother eric and my best friend kev and we're the moves team and we're seeking a 200 000 investment for a 15 equity stake in our company sharks i don't know about you but when guests enter my home and keep their shoes on it drives me crazy oh yeah he gets really really intense about it shoes bro you're trying dirt bacteria and who else knows what he's right so for eric we make sure to wear our slippers we're in the house they're great and all but if i have to run outside for a quick trip like taking out the trash or walking the dog i don't have to find my shoes put on sock tie laces i just want to go it was up to me i would leave the house and then come right back choose bro so to fix this comment problem we created moves footwear moves footwear is the only footwear on the market with dual soul technology oh my god so now harry can keep his floors clean and ryan could transition to an outdoor shoe in one easy step while he's out and about his moves he's both comfortable and stylish no one even knows he's in his house slippers we engineered the moves to hold on tight whether he's walking running or even jumping oh there it is there it is the coolest thing about having removable outsoles is they're all completely interchangeable now changing the look and feel of your shoe has never been easier so sharks who's ready to join the movement and help the world move easy wow can we try the music of course thank you guys we actually set you all up with your own personal pair of movies can i try so please pull the tool tab in front of you lift it up yeah robert we made yours red to match one of your race cars lori the closest thing we had to white for the queen was carolina blue no you gave me carolina blue look at this side of the box mark on the other side um yeah right now we are currently just in the front we actually named it after you and your team mavericks blue uh carolina black yes damon those are our post pipers in the streetwear industry the all blacks i mean if one of the trucks want to come up and help them demonstrate just like you would kick off your normal shoes like how you use your back yeah so basically what you want to do is when you come home and you're entering your house you want to remove the outer sole so you're going to plant your toes down firmly on the ground step on the back and then clean your normal shoes and then lift forward there you go there it is yeah so the back is designed for when you want to move a little bit more um so it's it's an elastic kill kind of cool what do you think damon i think they're cool thank you the design is cool too we focused very much on the design itself what do you sell them for 110 and they include shipping and what's your cost to land 26 that's good and what what have you sold so we've done 73 000 in sales since april with uh practically zero marketing spent online online so basically uh majority of our sales are e-commerce so it goes through our social media channels what we're doing in the second phase of the business is allowing the customers to buy the outer soles separately right so that you're building your products so how much does it cost you to make one and what would you sell it for just the outsole is eight dollars eight dollars right and you can sell it for 19 or 29 or whatever yeah that's right so that's where your real money's going to come yeah but there could be an app this is cool as hell this is cool as hell it's been a really big impulse purchase but the best part about it is we have a less than two percent return rate tell me about your challenges you had when creating this where do we start uh well we traveled china twice our first factory after uh financing samples and mold costs and material sourcing they were about three to four months into it and they told us that the project was impossible it couldn't be done it could not be done so we honestly truth be told we purchased supplies from a um over-the-counter hardware store brought them to our garage in new jersey nice where they casted my foot as a mold and then that was our first proof of concept with rubber power broke baby that's that's yeah that's all it is it wasn't perfect but for us it was beautiful and it was enough to investors so guys i'm not a slippers guy okay i'm not a shoes bro household right how are you going to get to the point where you have enough people where you can sell enough that it matters well we're hoping to utilize a platform of athletes because they have hundreds of thousands if not millions of followers why are athletes attracting big focus to position ourselves as the post-game footwear but i think that's a different market isn't that like what's athleisure a lot of people actually have indoor slippers and then outdoor slippers so they'll have their pair of slippers that they only wear in their house i think that's a new jersey thing people wear slippers outside now so what we're doing is we're pitching the comfort and convenience but we're adding functionality and then also capitalizing on the hygiene factor it's it's different if there's no question about it it's you walked in here with something we haven't seen before absolutely and when it comes to shoes that's rare but to me it's not proven yet i admire what are you talking about to me this is a tough tough tough business well i don't find your valuation crazy i find the wrist crazy i'm out thanks i appreciate that thank you guys my challenge is not the product or design i think we all loved it up here i think the branding part of it is going to be really really hard i i wish you all the best because it's a fantastic product i just don't know how you're going to get to market like that without burning massive amounts of money i'm out thank you appreciate your feedback yeah guys i'm kind of in the same boat it's hard and you guys already know that and i don't even think it's about the amount of money it's just it's going to be a slog i just don't have an angle where i can just walk in and say this is it and if i don't see that angle that i can just take a hold of and run with it then it's just not a deal for me so for those reasons i'm out [Music] i think it's really quite brilliant um you know for me as as an impact it's cool thank you thank you it's an investment for me so much i'm just not sure um so the way we see you helping us is definitely with your expertise and qvc and getting us in front of the eyes listen there's so many people that do not want shoes in the house if you can get another shark here to go in with me i'll go in and i'm going to leave that to you now oh for sure that's that's fair damon you're the only one left oh so damon i know you have bomba socks so we we know that as a yeah i also own the company tonic as well yes a footwork company but this is a this is a tough one i love the design i love the product the ingenuity so i don't want to even insult you with an offer three sharks are out laurie may be interested in ryan eric and kevin's removable soul shoe company moves but wants to partner with another shark damon you're the only one left this is a man this is a tough one i love the design i love the product the ingenuity so i don't want to even insult you with an offer well let's hear it um would you be willing to possibly go in with lori offering money is never an insulting never an insult never never be insulted by money all right so i'm just letting you know the reason why i would give you this offer is because surely i would be taking you someplace to license this you do not want to do this business yourself you really don't and that's where we see it for us we're looking for that you know the shark to partner with to get that exit strategy it would be two hundred thousand for one-third of the company hello is laureen on that deal [Music] yeah oh yes definitely um lori do you have anything to offer as well i've not been in the men's footwear space before i think it's more i just would prefer to have one of the sharks with me on this damon would have been a great partner but he threw me under the bus yeah yeah it would be i mean my main goal would be licensing yeah what do you think of his offer i think it's a great offer um are you gonna take it no no um i would like to counter if you're if you're okay with two hundred thousand for twenty-five percent it's just so that we can have ten percent remaining in case we run in some a roadblock and we have to raise additional capital and we're in new jersey we're a stone's throw away from from your headquarters he's never been to new jersey he's in manhattan really but we know we know where your office is yeah we know your offices is stalking you i'm just saying but i mean did they risk these people here and they know where you live all right let's do it let's go let's go congrats guys that's awesome thank you so much good job thank you thank you congratulations great shark for you guys definitely good job dj that's a great deal having damon on board we believe we can be a global brand in a few years his licensing and manufacturing capabilities will strengthen and accelerate our growth and we couldn't be happier damon is is our dream shark you ", "Sparketh": "first in the tank is a business seeking to spark creativity in kids hey xerx i'm duane and i'm tim we're childhood best friends and co-founders from atlanta georgia and we're seeking a hundred thousand dollars for eight percent in equity and our company sparketh a child's mind is like a blank canvas there's no limit to the magic they can create they're filled with curiosity ideas and emotions but with art not being a priority in schools they really get the opportunity to explore them and that's why we created sparkit an online art education platform for kids and teens where they can learn art anywhere and everywhere esparkitth membership comes with access to our library with over 1 000 art video lessons taught by engaging mentors within their specialized fields spark at this build from the ground up with awesome features that cater towards kids and teens such as five to ten minute bite-sized video lessons and a virtual art portfolio that they can create and share with our global community with sparca's creative spark budding artists from blank sheet of paper to complete masterpiece you have us curious [Music] wow that's cool wow so starks who wants to help make the next generation the most creative generation by investing and sparking our work of art i definitely wanted to do a quick activity with you guys yeah okay we're gonna draw a very quick and easy step-by-step feather take the toothbrush and you're going to swipe away [Music] going left to right just like that so you're going to go from top blend them as you're coming down just like that damn i'm talented okay at the end you're gonna take the back of your toothbrush and gonna start at the top and you're gonna slide all the way down to create the stuff so i actually call this piece a man's inhumanity to man what is that mark it's a self-portrait [Music] i have a tornado i like that that's the most abstract beautiful one in here you say that to all the girls come on so how do you sell who's your audience for how much so to start off we start off with the homeschool market and over time it branched off into any parent who is struggling to teach their kids creativity how do you reach those parents the homeschool market is really like closed off and tight-knit so it's hard to get into so we kind of like infiltrated ourselves into it we went to expos so when we started sparking we started off by going to one expo and to get into that expo we literally had no money we were broke college students we started with 500 and after we built the website which we didn't have the best technology so i worked at a graphic design job and so i snuck tim into the office after hours yeah for days i love it yeah yeah and we taught ourselves php css and html just enough to build out the mvp yeah i taught the courses he filmed and edited them that's my passion filming video so he's the artist here he's gonna so where'd you guys go to college kennesaw state university in atlanta georgia georgie but we ended up dropping out when the business was uh you know as it started growing so how good is the business if it's enough for you to drop out for me i think that personally i just love entrepreneurship and i realized that that was my passion early on and also i was born with sickle cell disease so that's been like super tough on me sickle cell disease is a blood disorder and so the average lifespan of someone with sickle cell is 30 years old and that's when it really clicked in my mind that i was like i don't really have time to take the traditional path or anything i have to go for what i want what i'm passionate about and that's entrepreneurship i truly feel like i'm very gifted in it and even if i wasn't making a single dollar or i was a billionaire tomorrow like some of you guys i would be getting up every day and doing entrepreneurship so how old are you now i'm i'm 25 years old now yeah he looks like a baby how did you guys meet what's your story man so so we actually met as kids growing up through a mutual friend and through magic tricks actually yeah we we love magic yeah do you guys actually want to see one real quick yes yeah for sure all right cool so you know we did go through a lot of dark times in life but you know this is a very bright situation [Music] nice there you go it was black before right yeah it was black before good one yeah all right what are you doing in revenue so last year we did 300k in revenue all direct to consumer all yeah all b2c online art classes yeah it's a subscription model business so a parent will sign up and pay 25 a month and then they get two student accounts so you have to acquire that customer then you've got to keep them there what does the cost you acquire customer and how many actually stick with you past 12 months yeah so right now no one's sticking with us past 12 months there's about more around like 160 is a lifetime customer value which is about like six to seven months is around the time that people are staying and 51 and 50 cents to acquire a customer whoa hey dwayne you mentioned you made three hundred thousand dollars last year was that your first year in business no it wasn't our first year in business we actually started in 2015. we are not profitable though say last year come the last two years how did they compare last year we did 300k the year before that was 75k and then the year before that was 110k so something did happen in there um what happened is 2018 we pushed ourselves so hard traveling non-stop we were going to homeschool expos we started with one then the next year we had three then we did 11. then we did 22. and the sickle cell and just not getting a break every weekend selling and being on my feet we i ended up like putting myself in the hospital like and dwayne also ended up putting himself in the hospital we were both hospitalized at the same time at the launch of the website so we went through the guys will do anything for a vacation what's the 100k for how are you going to use it so the 100k is for content and to build out a better version of the platform another quick question so you're how much are you burning per month we break even so we just so you're not making money but you're not really losing exactly we could be profitable if we wanted to we just are spending so we don't we haven't had a guy tried to be profitable is this a business or is this a hobby [Music] so this is this is a business why it makes no money we haven't tried to be profitable you haven't even told us what you're tracking so far for 2021. yeah 2021 we're on track to do 500k this year well listen for me i love creativity i love opening up kids minds to be inventive and to create but for me i'm not really the app person so for that reason but i'm going to go out okay thank you so much thank you so much okay guys i i look at it and say how as an investor because i i like what you're doing and i think there's there's merit in it um a hundred thousand dollars for eight percent so 1.25 million dollar valuation for business that is let's call it what it is it breaks even right i give you a hundred thousand dollars how would i get that back listen kevin i'm going to tell you this and be honest this is more than just getting a quick buck back this is more about a true vision we want to impact the world i should set aside my traditional demands for returns exactly of money and get something else and you see the impact to change the world i can't invest in this i'm not yeah all right i totally understand guys look i i see where you're going with this the real challenge i see in this as a business you don't have that one thing to hang your hat on you need something that says this is why we are different this is what makes us unique why am i going to do this instead of just watching free youtube videos you don't have that one marketing thing for you guys that's an accelerant and and that's unfortunate so for those reasons i'm out you guys are so charismatic and endearing and i listen to you and i'm looking for a reason to invest and you keep using the same phrase if we wanted to make money we could we can but you really have to convince an investor how to make money but because i really love you i'm gonna make you an offer oh i'm gonna offer you a hundred thousand dollars for 20 of your business ouch but it's contingent on you proving to me after six months that you've been able to make a profit if you don't make the profit you don't get the money if you make the profit you get the hundred thousand dollars guys i'm struggling enormously because i can tell that you're actually holding it inside and i can tell that the struggles are probably even greater yeah they are knowing the sickle cell disease that you have and standing up and continuing to work and not give up on your dream of getting chills just thinking about your journey and at the same time you're treating this as a charity rather than with the seriousness and respect of an entrepreneurial vision well said so i would like to partner with barbara if she's up to it and i'd like to mentor you together with her but give you the six months to turn into a business if you'd like me as your partner it depends daniel i mean it's only 20 for 10 equity you're willing to jump in here for these

get not one but two sharks daniel and barbara i realized that i've always had this potential within me and dwayne were unstoppable you ", "LovePop Cards": "I'm womi and I'm John and we're from Boston Massachusetts I think this should be more of a pirate red John and I met 10 years ago in college studying ship design Naval architecture and Marine engineering we reconnected at Harvard Business School a few years later and decided to pursue a business idea together I think we got it let's get it in the computer we use our background and ship design to create a unique twist to an existing product we're using the same software we're using the same 3D thinking that can help people create meaningful connection this business means everything neither of us took a job coming out of school we're under a lot of student loans we pretty much invested all of our money into this business we could have taken lucrative jobs after graduating Harvard but we believe so strongly in our idea that this is all we want to focus on we need a shark to help us grow the business open more retail outlets and really get our brand out there we want to continue to touch people's lives with our designs and a shark can make that possible in a big way [Music] hi I'm John and this is my partner womi and we're the creators of love pop and we're here here today to offer you 10% of our company for $300,000 remember that time when you were in the drugstore and you were searching for a birthday card you're going through that rack of thoughtless uninspired Cards doing that multiple choice selection process and you end up with something that's okay don't settle anymore come to love Pop where we create intricate paper art that pops just like this in today's digital and distracting World things might be coming more impersonal but a love Pop is unique because it's unexpected it's tangible the reaction we've gotten has been so positive and so emotional that we realized we're tapping into something much bigger the human need to connect so sharks help us spread the love we actually have a couple special edition cards for you guys here today good I would expect anything less here you go thank you you're welcome Lori thank you oh wow that is so cool I love it how unexpected it is yours is shopping love it yeah shop to your Dr what's yours Barbara real estate of course but his is money yeah his is cool absolutely yeah I like his what's yours Mark basketball shocking shocking look how intricate it is so tell us about the business model you handcrafting each of these are you online s or at St so let's let's break it apart into two questions so the one is what's the business model how are we selling these and one is how do we manufacture good idea I love how you're controlling the sharks so we'll start with the first one which is uh how do we sell them so we have four kiosks in Boston so in Boston in Boston that's right where are they that's Hometown exactly so our strategy is kiosks and that's where we meet the customer that's where they have the experience opening the cards what you just experienced then those customers come online into the love Pop ecosystem where we offer additional services like send us Sur prize where we'll actually handr write a note in the card and mail it okay what does that cost $8 to $13 a card and if you choose to send a surprise option it's $5 more are you guys artists what's your background so we've actually known each other for 10 years we went to undergrad ship design school together really I went to Louisiana and actually designed ships for 4 years we're traveling in Asia and we came across this art form of slice form kirami yeah and we fell in love we were just like oh my God the possibilities are endless so we came back we started designing car we started selling cards to People John you just graduated 3 weeks ago how long have you been running the business so it's been a year and a half entirely while in school and what are your sales in that year and a half uh $300,000 but if it's an artisian business and you guys are Harvard grads did you ever test price sensitivity because why wouldn't this this is absolutely stunning why would it be $129 why isn't why it's a piece of art why isn't it $99 we want this to be an accessible but you want to make money right that's true but we do make money right now we laser cut these cards we designed them in a computer literally the same software that I use to design ships let's say I sent you 3,000 orders a month how would you produce them we actually open our own production facility overseas we produce 20,000 cards a month right now and we're scaling that up and how many different designs we have about 100 different designs right now let's take a single kiosk and extrapolate over a 12-month working period yeah what do you think the revenue will be so we about 20 $40,000 per kiosk per kiosk what would be the profit on that it's going to be about $40,000 and what percentage of a kiosk person goes to the website and buys more product so we tested this for a month and a half and we had 34 people come online and buy that's not a lot actually yeah we believe in the kiosk model as a marketing vehicle why because it's profitable so we are attracting customers profitably and our focus is on building the brand and then taking that Community online and that is actually your focus is on building a customer base that in turn creates a brand for you through their awareness so what is the capital cost for each kiosk it takes around $220,000 flat to open a kiosk can I tell you what I don't like about your business quite honestly at first when you started talking I got all excited I thought oh maybe this is my next cousin's main lobster two guys running a shop are pretty happy making $200,000 a month on one truck but the difference between you and them is they're not fancy and I kind of like that they wanted to get everything perfectly in order before they even bought their second company truck the cards they're nice but I've seen pop-up cards in every fancy store I've gone to what's the difference there your little kiosk idea it's a smart idea but I'm telling you it's too much too fast too fancy that I mistrust it and I've invested in businesses like that and I always lose my shirt so sadly out thank you thank you I think that they're beautiful beautiful cards and I think that people will love it but I can't see your valuation right now $300,000 for 10% so I'm out thank you L I have a lot of businesses that are in this space online that are involved around marriage and engagement and times when people emotionally are willing to spend a lot on on artisian items like this let me show you something because I think you'll find it interesting for your wedding customers yeah it's beautiful oh that's it's spectacular and I have so many customers that would buy this and the thing that I love about those customers they don't care what it costs what is the price of this at 100 at a time so we've sold those packages for between 2 and $3,000 for how many 100 to 200 and our minimums are actually pretty low guys the way I understand your MTO is it's a get wide as opposed to get tall model where you want to get as many locations as you can but malls with traffic those rents are going up and those kios spaces are going to get more and more expensive I think you can do it I just don't think you can be big enough because of the risk within the real estate industry so for those Reasons I'm out thank you Mike I see that you guys have a fanatical culture around service and your customers execution is a little bit questionable because you haven't done enough of it on scale but I'll make you an offer 300,000 for 20% you want to partner on that Robert I have a lot of customers here I don't think it's big enough for me to partner On It Kevin I think you want to take it to a different same offer exactly I'm no partner and I bring a pretty big database I think I can bring a lot of customers to you what are you going to [Music] do three three sharks are out womi and John have two equal offers from Robert and Kevin for their greeting card company love Pop you have two offers now all of a sudden Roberts which is 300,000 at 20% and you have Kevin's which is equal I think I can bring a lot of customers to you yeah I think you got to build up the retail presence what are you going to do first thank you very much for those offers uh we do believe that our valuation is fair at 3 million

with my other companies in this space well I see the retail present I love the idea of the kiosk model you got to build out the customers that'll get you the brand and by the way I'm in Boston so just

inside somewhere and you're in Boston we love the wedding connections yeah that's phenomenal I'm make a killing with this it's great guys it's cool thank you very much excited you there's risk thank you goodbye boys bye congratulations we're really excited about the value that Mr Wonderful is going to bring he's a phenomenal business mind and he understands a wedding business which is a big potential opportunity for us ", "Range Beauty": "first in the tank is a beauty brand with inclusivity in mind [Music] hi sharks i'm alicia i'm aisha we're two cousins here from atlanta georgia and we're seeking 150k for six percent equity in our company [Music] sharks how can you feel beautiful in the skin you're in if you feel forgotten not only did the both of us struggle to find makeup for our beautiful brown skin but we also couldn't find skin care products made with our skin types in mind that's why we set out on a mission to create range beauty range beauty is clean beauty for the forgotten shades and we utilize botanicals in our formulas specially made for eczema and acne prone skin now any and everyone can feel beautiful comfortable and confident in their own skin at range beauty our true intentions hydrating foundation is available in 21 underrepresented shades using calendula flower to help with itchiness and irritation french clay to help with those nasty and unwanted toxins and even vitamin e to help keep your skin healthy and glowing that's right we keep it clean sharks we're merging inclusive makeup with natural skin care maisha show off all that melanin sharks you better get into this glow we should all be in love with our skin no matter the shade or type so sharks will you join us in showing off our range to the world great job you see our beautiful products in front of you emma we gave you our true intentions hydrating foundation the full size as well as our sample kit which we offer online to help our guests find their perfect shade really nice packaging barbara we gave you our bali full body glow i need it yes it is packed with a superfood argan oil beautiful color what about me am i chopped liver oh don't worry we're coming that way golden hour dual eye highlight to match that glowing smile wow you have our true intense bronzing primer it's a moisturizer and a primer and mr wonderful don't think to flush you out we know you i was thinking you don't love mr wonderful you have a lot of skin i have a lot of skin that's right sign free and i was just by the way i was just admiring so we gave you our smooth out translucent powder which is talc free and that helps combat shine and gives you a smooth flawless look what's your background how did you even come up with this i actually grew up loving fashion i went off to virginia tech for fashion design and merchandising and immediately after graduation i was on my way to new york and i would be behind the scenes at runway shows campaign shoots and i noticed a lot of the black models were coming to set with their own makeup kits and it made me pause and finally ask a model what was so special about this kit and she said on a previous campaign the makeup artist flat out said i can't do the look the designer is requesting because i don't have anything in my kit for your skin tone and it resonated with me because i never felt represented or seen by the beauty industry and at the same time i was also dealing with very bad cystic acne and head to toe eczema so i did not feel pretty very pretty and i just had an aha moment that why can't i merge both of these worlds why can i create makeup that includes our tones and deeper and also takes care of your skin while you wear especially if you're dealing with eczema and acne myesha what did you do in the business so i did 10 years in the united states army i'm a veteran single mom wow thank you for your service i'm like the product manager i went to school to be esthetician to learn about skin care just so i can assist her in any and everything that she needs talk to us a little bit about the business and also like what makes you guys different i would say the main thing is that our angle is x-men acne most of the times makeup brands they're thinking about we want you to keep coming back to us so you can keep covering it up while we're coming from the angle of yes we want you to be able to cover it up and feel comfortable but at the same time also have healthy skin that's our angle and we launched at the end of august of 2018 i completely bootstrapped this for about three years at the end of 2018 we left with about 20k 2019 we ended 45k i quit my job in december of 2019 to take on range full-time so last year was my first full year and we ended up with 330k wow how did you get how did you get the 330 how did you do it so last year showed us that actually ecommerce does reign supreme and so i made sure i already had things in place to help us with that our sample kit for foundations we gave you five dollars in exchange for you to put towards a full-size product so 80 of our customers who purchased our samples came back to buy a full size that's very smart last year we actually picked up our first major big box retailer and we are currently in talks with one of the largest beauty retailers to actually go in store in on which retailer target how's it selling through it's been selling out does target explain the 330 000 uptick in sales i would say last year with everything going on there was a huge spotlight put on black owned businesses and that exposure was exposure that we did not have the marketing budget for uh we were featured by beyonce on her website we were covered by major publications amazing right there yes and that absolutely contributed what's the price point give me a rough yes so our foundation is 21. it lands at 425 for cost and we wholesale at 10.50 so you're like at the mastige level absolutely what is mesty messyge is in between drugstore products and prestige products so if you're it's right in the middle i'm so happy to teach you something today i don't know well at least we taught him something about your business today i'm gonna make it easy i'm gonna clear the deck because literally the only two things i understand what they are are the mirror and the toothbrush so for those reasons i'm out okay thank you do you do the lighter skin shades or is it just because you said 21 shades right yes so we are inclusive we prioritize black women and women of color because we are the most underrepresented even though we spend the most so we spend annually 7.5 billion in beauty we spend 80 more on makeup than the mainstream market and two times more on skin care we are also exposed two times more to toxic beauty products because of the lack of clean alternatives for our skin tones and so the necessity for clean products for women of color is there but our line is inclusive to go two fair shades from ferris to fair to deepest to deep oh good [Music] i think you're amazing but um i like to make a big difference in the businesses i invest in i'm listening hard as to where i might fit in and i don't see the angle okay so because of that reason i think you're going to find a better partner here so i'm out thank you barbara i completely understand you know normally when uh makeup deals come in shark tank i'm pretty hard on them because they don't have any strategy on how to differentiate themselves and i was expecting to eviscerate you on that topic but actually uh you do have a differentiation yes i am not your shark i'm going to be hopeful for you but i'm out thank you oh thank you so much um we've had a little conversation we think that we'd like to make you an offer [Music] so you know when you get two sharks gotta be a little different than what you walked in asking for that's right so we would like to offer you 150 000 but for 20 and you're gonna get two sharks and you're going to get all of our knowledge and expertise in every arena which is really going to help you a lot i mean there was a pair to have so thank you so much for your offer honored would you be willing to do 150 for 10 no and you know girls i think that what you've done is really great it feels good it feels it feels to me like a premium product so i loved it when you said this was priced at the masjid level right and incoming you know requests from retail is one thing actually making it work when it gets there is something completely different and that's where you're going to need the help right that's where the experience and the expertise and taking what you guys do over here and actually making it work on the shop floor is going to become really really important i know that there are retailers out there i sit on the board of this incredible non-profit called the 15 pledge yes and actually you know it you know it because all the retailers that you're trying to get into have taken the pledge and what that means is that all of these businesses are looking at how can we increase the level of sales that we have with black owned businesses right they're all trying to get there so you guys are like a target for any of those businesses but you still gotta work right and that's where the benefit of two sharks can be really really key because it's not easy once you get into retail i'll tell you it's every week being on top of it it's constant you know innovation for your product line it's staying ahead of the competition considering where your sales are today i think's a good deal would you be willing to do 200k for 20 i like these guys you're going back into the other direction what she says is so true because for some people it's impossible to even get in right but it's staying on the shelf right it's that's hugely important if you don't they're as quick to knock you out because it's valuable real estate right right and it's limited so i i think we've given you an amazing offer [Music] okay you have a deal [Music] congratulations guys well done i feel like i can do something so much with emma being all about the 15 pledge and really rooting for black owned businesses and black women owned businesses and then just understanding how important range beauty is to that community unbelievable unbelievable you ", "Junobie": "next up is a way to save every last drop of a precious resource hi I'm Nikki Ramsey and I'm from West Lafayette Indiana and I'm here seeking 100 000 for 10 equity in my company sharks when I became a mom and started breastfeeding I was going through thousands of these single-use plastic storage bags to give my baby white gold I wanted a better way to store my breast milk and I knew it wasn't just me that felt this way after countless attempts at trying to store my breast milk I was left with white gold leaking all over the place precious gold sharks soap instead of the five ounces that I needed I was only left with two I literally cried over spilled milk a safe effective and space-saving storage option for all mamas out there sharks no more crying over spilled milk because now you have janovi a revolutionary plastic free and reusable breast milk storage bags fine ginobi is eco-friendly made using 100 food grade silicone and stains the test of time unlike other products out there that have no lines or measurements and can't stand upright our patent-pending product is specifically made with your baby in mind I want a mission to bring jinobi to parents everywhere for the future of our planet and for the future of our children so if you want your milk fresh fresh as can be then you have to try ginobi sharks in front of you are your very own janobe products to try out and test for yourselves so do you just slide this off yes it comes with a slider in order to make sure that the breast milk stays secure because silicone is a very soft material and it has to have something a little bit so it's dishwasher safe it's high heat tolerant I have to say this particular slider is very easy to put on which I didn't expect to be put on I'm very sure as it slides into place it stands on its own absolutely so yeah during the demonstration right so Barbara brings up a great point they can stand upright or if you compress them and squeeze all the air out they have the capability to lay flat because moms we all know they like to freeze their breast milk of course just for later use how did you come up with this so I was a traveling therapist just returned from maternity leave I had a baby of course and he had a tongue tied lip tie and um it's like a medical condition and he was nursing a lot as a result of his nursing my body he thought okay I need to produce more milk and I was going through thousands of these single-use plastic breast milk bags I went to the marketplace to look for something that was a reusable product specifically made for the size of breast milk which typically women store in four to six ounces and I couldn't find anything of course like it because it didn't exist so I started working on it and I tapped into a need honestly that I did not know existed incredible okay how much they retail at 34.99 for the four pack in our two pack retails at 19. okay and what does it cost you to make the four pack the four pack landed is at around seven dollars and eighty cents and our two pack landed is around four dollars okay good margins I was just going to say I love this part I breastfed both of my children but both of my children were born very early so the breast milk like that hasn't kind of kicked in yet becomes like gold but what I want to understand is like what your competition is who else is doing this so ginobi launched uh November 2019 within six months unfortunately we did have some uh some knockoffs coming the market and the knockoffs they can't compare to ginobi one of our competitions they have a bag and literally you can take the bag and just squeeze it open and the milk just spills out what are your sales our sales for this year today have been eighty six thousand dollars did you light up Amazon yet so we were on Amazon but because we have an inventory crisis I'll say we diverted ourselves from Amazon to our website so we can retain more of our money we're not on Amazon now not on Amazon well but she said something more interested you said you didn't have enough inventory because since we've been self-funding our self pretty much with money that comes into the company um we would so you needed to have money come in before you could buy exactly what's your lead time for the manufacturing six weeks Nikki I want to hear a little bit more about you I grew up in a very non-traditional household as a teenager I experienced homelessness one night while I was sleeping on this abandoned Apartment floor I thought to myself there has to be a way out of this generational cycle this generational curse of poverty and thankfully I told my school counselor what was going on with me and she was able to connect me with this homeless shelter and they let me stay there until I finished my academics and then I went on to college and graduated college and graduate school it's a blessing and a miracle that I'm standing here right now they'll never give up great story fabulous story talk to us a little bit more about the business you said you've done 86 000 in sales this year but what are you projecting for the rest of the year and I'm assuming the main reason you're here talking to us is because you don't have the money to fund your production is that right yes so we are projecting three hundred thousand dollars in sales by the end of this year wow amazing do you have them in stores we were working with a broker to get us in retail but when you work with a broker it can get a little expensive and with the pandemic we thought that it was better to take the money that we were giving the broker and put it back into our inventory all right so when I do a deal on Shark Tank I like to get my hands dirty in the product okay it's true because I try and tell a story about it to my millions of followers but obviously this is a disconnect for me I mean I haven't been worrying about breast milk too much lately I mean I think you're terrific I wish you the best but I'm out thank you Kevin yeah I'm kind of in the same boat congratulations on your success the the road you've taken to get where you're at I mean it's incredible and you deserve so much credit but this is certainly not my wheelhouse so for those Reasons I'm out thank you Marge you're welcome well after 13 seasons you know it is hard to say that you're not going to go in on a deal when you really love an entrepreneur you're unbelievably impressive I think you're fantastic you saw a need you had a problem you created a solution but I don't think that this is the right business for me I wish you good luck on that okay thank you Lori you know Nikki I really really like you I love your story and I love where you're at right now I think it's incredible I think that the businesses that do really well right now are those that have a purpose and that can really you know get an audience and speak to a very very specific audience and I love the fact that this is a sustainable product and that you've got a real clear Market so I'm actually going to make you an offer I think that you are at the beginning of the journey you're going to need a lot of help so I'm going to give you the hundred thousand but I think I need 25 of the business that's fine [Music] now here are other offers you're so nice here so I'll just you know I'm just raising my hands never know the office here ready to roll that's a great offer let me just tell you I would have given the say more for 25 so wish you luck at Matt Nikki what do you want to do would you do a hundred and fifty thousand for twelve percent whoa wow no Nikki right here don't over negotiate everybody here has dropped out so I'm your only hope right now right I'm just gonna tell you how it is because what you need right now is so much I can help you but I think that my offer is pretty fair look you're still gonna own 75 of it right yeah you're still going to be rich I'll give you the other side of that 25 is a hefty slice yes I'm sure you got to where you were trusting your instinct and making your own judgments and from the way I see it you've done pretty well so you might go into your own self and ask you how that fits well I wasn't looking at giving up that much Equity out of our company just yet would you do a hundred thousand dollars at 15 Equity oh I'll do a hundred thousand dollars at 22.5 final offer um that is a lot of liquid gold spilling [Music] we were not looking at giving up that much equity you can definitely walk back out that door and you can spend the next few years trying to accelerate this business or you can work with me and do it a hell of a lot quicker but you know it's your choice [Music] wow [Music] you got a deal yeah ", "Wicked Good Cupcakes": "[Music] my name's tracy noonan and this is my daughter danielle we're from cohasset massachusetts and our company is wicked good cupcakes we're from bastard and everything's wicked pisa here our cupcakes are baked fresh daily from scratch no boxes or mixes are ever used i am head baker and she is head decorator you need help with anything danielle and i have always been very close we make all our decisions together no no we don't she makes the most of the decisions all the time mom the red velvets are done we're at a point where our company is growing too fast for us to keep up and we actually have a new twist on how to share our wicked good cupcakes with the nation oh this was only half a dozen yeah are you worried the shacks won't understand that accent no i'm not worried they won't understand us [Applause] [Music] hi sharks i'm tracy noonan and this is my daughter danielle we own and operate wicked good cupcakes we're here today seeking 75 000 in return for 20 equity in our company two years ago buttercup moved out as a mom i was heartbroken i decided we should take cake decorating classes as a way to spend some time together well before we knew it in october 2011 wicked good cupcakes was born we received tons of requests to ship our cupcakes nationwide it was a big challenge though trying to figure out how to keep them fresh and intact and that's when we came up with the idea of shipping them in a jar our cupcake jars are baked fresh daily we layer them with homemade frosting and filling ship them in gift boxes with spoons so they're ready to eat right out of the package basically they appeal to anyone with a mouth we're not afraid to work hard our days right now average 13 to 14 hours plus mom's definitely getting her fair share of time with me so which of you sharks will be the first to sink your choppers into our sweet deal it's definitely a risk worth taking we found that there's a lot of dough to be made from batter thank you we got to try it we actually have some for you to try they're wicked good they also have a much better shelf life thanks to the jazz can i have a job is that your job yeah i love your accent where are you from boston and then i don't want to be you thank you no problem cookies and cream is for you oh my god that's so good thank you buttercup well ladies let me say welcome to the shark tank i'm a fellow bostonian i live on marlboro street i love street that is one damn good jar of cake unbelievable look at this it's gone already isn't in the chat for you mac how many have you sold so far tracy from january of this year we've sold 73 000 worth of jars our cupcake shop has sold um 150 000 including the 73 000 of the jars so you have a store we have a retail storefront as well correct since october 2011. are we being asked to invest in the retail store and the jar cupcake company we're actually offering a piece of bone the retail shop as well as the jars basically our sales right now for this year are slated to be 360 thousand dollars the growth potential that we have discovered with these is phenomenal tracy it's not patented someone else can put a cake in a jar and ship it across the country absolutely they could so tell me what your plan is how are you going to grow this business quickly so that if i give you 75 000 i get richer that's all i care about we want to be the ben and jerry's of cupcakes how many days has the shelf life of a jar seven to ten seven so you've and sell it right away and ship it because it's going to be two days before it's in somebody's mouth right correct have you talked to anybody about extending the shelf life because i know it's something that you can do yeah with preservatives you know the problem if you put preservatives in it's a taste that's wonderful that's exactly that's exactly the question will it alter the taste what does each one cost to make and what do you sell them for the eight ounce jars cost two dollars and fifteen cents to make we retail that for 5.95 the 16 ounce shock costs three dollars to make and we retail that for 8.95 this product will never be in retail it's always going to be an online somebody buys it you bake it you send it overnight to them actually we do have some wholesale clients we have a coffee company up in massachusetts what are you charging her a jar we're charging her three dollars a jar it's not enough margin for you okay but here's the thing we're buying in such pathetic bulk right now if we had tracy in your best case scenario i give you the 75 000 yep tell me what your margins will be sure right now it costs you 2.15 cents to make the small one and three dollars for the big one right how much can you reduce the cost i believe we can get the small address down to 1.45 question i have is on the mason jars are there any alternative that would allow you to reduce your costs considerably i got to say the mason jars are a really big draw for people exactly you can't see it's motherhood and apple pie exactly it's a homemade product in a crafty container we suggest homemade right right exactly and people do say that to us i don't think there's anything wrong with your packaging i just think you might need a better supplier for the jar itself maybe you're not buying it a big enough bowl we need more money to buy in bigger bulk bottom line that's why we're here tracy as you can tell i'm not a i'm not a big dessert guy uh so you can pass yours down this way i know this is really good pass that to mark there's definitely a novelty aspect to it because i've never heard of a cupcake in a jar so i think you can sell some of those how'd you like the

and we're just going to do great you ", "Vabroom": "first in the tank is an innovation to a common household tool [Music] oh are you all right oh my gosh oh hey no problem no looking good looking good thank you hello sharks i'm trevor lambert from champlain minnesota and i'm john badness from white bear lake minnesota and we're seeking 350 000 for two and a half percent in our company sharks messes are everywhere whether your kid throws half their snack under the table or your cat fluffy trailing litter out of the box or me taking a spill on the tank all of us deal with messes every day but for quick cleanups who wants to lug out that bulky vacuum or break their back bending over chasing that last line of dirt with a dustpan come on now there's gotta be a better way well sharks there is introducing the broom a smarter way to clean your floors no more dust pans or bulky vacuums required with the broom just sweep dirt and debris into a pile then tilt to the side the pressure activated nozzle quickly and easily cleans up any mess see it's a vacuum it's a broom it is the broom it's quick and complete with just one sweep all of that power is just over two pounds so it's easy to maneuver and handle in those hard to reach places and when done just empty the trash clean and easy bombs away oh bombs away so sharks let's not sweep profits under the rug it's time to suck them up with the broom it's a vacuum it's a broom now sharks say it with us it's now who would like to give it a try i'd like to try it all right so so sweep it normal just how you normally watch it so it like into a little line right because yeah or a pile and then you line it up yeah like this it's pressure activated the floor it'll turn on [Music] very cool yes all right now let's just drop the bomb i want to see that happening so if a boom logo goes up yep yeah not bad so you all do have a sample and it's been shortened so that you can test it why not just buy a vacuum this really isn't intended to replace an upright vacuum it's meant for quick cleanups and that's really the goal that we're doing with bobroom as a brand so tell us about you i am married five kids i love you yeah a little bit like brady bunch that's the damn reason for the best and that's why we do what we do um but to go back a ways back in college i was starting to come up with different product ideas eventually i was being hired by others to help them license products in 2010 i founded a design firm and we have various industrial designers and engineers on staff and so we do come up with some of our own products but typically we get hired uh from various folks small medium-sized companies and that's how we met john i'm a fourth generation plumber and owner of my family company it's through that company i'm constantly seeing problems and i'm making solutions for them but that led to a lot of products that i patented and brought to market trevor and his company actually helped me launch one of my items and i saw a broom as just a 3d printed prototype i knew this was the time that trevor was looking to pivot to bring a product from prototype to retail and beyond and when the opportunity came for me to invest i knew this was the product so this must have taken off already uh we we have come with sales yes and a half percent give in the last 12 months we've done 3.1 million dollars in sales wow we're projecting 5 million conservatively this year where are you selling them nice we sell direct to consumer and we just started retail we just delivered to bed bath and beyond for a two month promo in two weeks they sold out of all their online stock that they had projected for the entire promo so tell me about the cost of the product what margin so it's just over seventeen dollars as a landed cost thirty seven dollars wholesale and uh retails were 59.99 what was the profit on 3.1 million in dollars it was about 300 and some thousand dollars which we've rolled right into inventory i don't see anything on the box that says patent pending or patented we have international patents pending we have a design patent that's issued in the u.s but i'm wondering how is it really different from like a dust buster or something like that where you know it's small it's handheld versus having to have a whole broom well good question i we when we developed it we just hate the dustpan it's such a frustrating pain point nobody in the history of everybody can get everything onto a dustpan which is why we did this and people see it right away now what else what we're getting on customer feedback is we're hearing people with mobility challenges that are coming to us this is a lifesaver i have a bad back and a stick back is too heavy for me and i can't bend over so this is now enabling them to actually clean their forest how much have you invested in this i invested two hundred thousand dollars good for you john uh there was a hundred thousand on kickstarter and then it was really funded self-funded by the company this firm that came up with this this industrial design firm am i investing i mean getting a piece of that great question so what we've done is we've shuffled some of our employees of the design firm into this new entity is there a contract between what i'm investing in and the design firm correct right so there's a royalty to the design firm that's right loyalty did i hear royalty yeah yeah a royalty so you would appreciate that so rather than have to you know vabroom to pay back the design firm for the investment we just decided it would be much cleaner if it wasn't how much how much is that investment five percent trevor and john why isn't it all together why have you made it so complicated well the issue is is that we have a service based design consultancy and other products that we're launching and we would but why don't you package that up well if there's interest we would entertain offers well otherwise it gets messy guys let me clear the deck a little bit here you guys are a design firm with inventors that are really good at that you're also good marketers but you're trying to segment things out so that you kind of have your cake and eat it too right you get to control the design firm you get to segment your product into this new company that you only want to give us two and a half percent of it's not worth getting up in the morning for two and a half percent particularly when your greatest skill set is more available to the design firm and anything else you come up with outside this company so for those reasons i'm out trevor and john i i have to say i thought your pitch was really good you clearly solve an issue i'm not convinced that the issue is that big and i hear your points that you've raised particularly with people that are actually finding it difficult to bend down but i'm not sure you need to reinvent the broom you've made it really complicated today so for that reason i'm out what was your initial ask two and a half percent for how much three hundred fifty thousand two and a half percent is either i just want exposure or i'm greedy i'm not saying either it's about you it's just this one goes through our head right it just doesn't feel right so uh i'm out i like the product okay i like the fact that it's selling making a deal with you is going to be complicated you need my 350 000 for inventory i assume right correct yeah all right and growing direct to consumer we we think that ashar could help us with our immediate definitely definitely and i can also sell this for you as chef wonderful on qvc and sell a millionaire yes that's not a problem but i mean i got to be incentivized to do it because there's only one chef wonderful not two here's an offer for you i'm known for being creative with my offers i teach the sharks how to structure things so 350 000 dollars i give you that because you brought up the word royalty i didn't you did i like royalties because that's how i get my capital back so i'll give you 350 thousand dollars i want a three dollar royalty on the va broom until i recoup seven hundred thousand dollars so i'm not being greedy about this okay i just want some return of capital but i want two and a half percent of the design firm because i don't know what else is coming down all right so equity sort of a venture debt deal in a way with the structure that i get paid back it's actually not bad it's not a bad deal at all listen guys i i love innovators and innovation and you know it's a good idea but i'm not sure you'll get your patent and there's so much competition i'm sorry i'm out okay thank you lord so as usual all roads lead to mr wonderful 350 000 for a two and a half percent three dollar royalty until you get 700 and that's of the whole design firm yes yes you're only interested in if it's the design firm absolutely i mean look i'm hopeful that it's not just going we're gonna form a relationship i'm gonna help you sell these things you're gonna see the power of what the shark can do and i want to get the next product the next product the next product the next product that's the whole idea uh could could we increase your investment to 700 000 and get you to 5 no this is a good snack bracket for this particular deal i like this entry point we get this thing going it starts working we'll do many other things together ask anybody look at the bertello pizza guys boost oxygen everybody i've upped on everybody because it's working i like things that work yeah mr wonderful you're definitely a shark we wanted to uh do a deal with and you suck up well too um yeah mr wonderful you've got a deal nice job kevin all right let me tell you why i did this i buy a new broom for barbara every year so she can fly around and i really like it i really like this model this is fantastic thanks for doing business with me it's going to be great thank you all right appreciation congratulations guys well done thanks for careful hey thanks sharks well done guys let's go yeah buddy all right we got mr wonderful that's who he came in for yeah and we got it he's gonna he's gonna help us on the media it's gonna be great we kept the valuation oh absolutely we did yeah fantastic so it'd be great to have him actually with the design firm absolutely he will be so helpful and more way more than just for broom oh my god very exciting what a marathon what a marriage you ", "Just The Cheese": "[Applause] my name is david sharpman and i'm from madison wisconsin i grew up in a family of cheese makers my mom and dad bought a little cheese company in 1991 growing up around a cheese company it was a lot of fun i got to go out on demos selling cheese handing out samples when i was 16 i started working in the factory doing jobs that no one else wanted to do my dad wanted everyone to know that i wasn't getting any special treatment eventually i graduated into sales jobs that didn't require a hair net i loved working at my parents cheese company but i wanted to set out on my own path i tried my hand at bringing wisconsin cheese to asia but that ultimately failed so then i tried to make wisconsin cheese in asia and that also failed i applied to business school after i graduated i became a consultant in new york city ultimately wanted to be back in small business and that's when my wife and i had a great idea and all roads lead back to cheese i need investment from the sharks to get more people to try my product as soon as people try it they love it they keep buying it my family and i have invested over a million dollars in this if this product fails a lot of people lose their jobs a lot of people will lose money it's important for me to make sure i justify the risk my dad took on me i want to make him proud and turn this risk into a huge success [Applause] [Music] oh cheesehead hi my name is david sharpman and i'm the owner of just the cheese and i'm asking for a half a million dollars for five percent of my business wow now i know what you're thinking a half million dollars is a lot of cheddar and you're right but our business is cheese our cheese is delicious and our business is booming you know when you make a grilled cheese sandwich the best part is the cheese that melts off into the pan and gets crunchy well most people look at that and think man i wish i could eat just the cheese since we're a family of cheese makers we look at it and think huh how can we turn that into a snack bar so let me show you how we do it first we start with wisconsin milk make our own fresh cheese in-house shred just a little bit into a cookie cutter mold pop it in the oven that is it no rice no fillers it's just the cheese comes in two bars in a pack it's the perfect grab-and-go snack for anytime anywhere and because it's just the cheese everyone will love it so now for the best part let's try them let's try them feel free to read the ingredient list it's a quick read and short different flavors yep aged cheddar is our top seller if you like stronger flavors i'd start there grilled cheese is more mild really good um i have to admit i've had this before really what yes i bought it on amazon you are not alone with that we sell between four and 700 boxes a day on amazon it's very i believe it's so simple how many calories per bar per bar 75. that's it that's it the package with two bars 150 calories eight grams of protein it's sugar-free gluten-free why can't anybody knock you off i mean you're doing something so simple anybody can do this right theoretically yes but there's a lot of science that goes into cheese making and we have some extremely technical there's a ton of brands out there ahead of you i think your brand is better i love just the cheese you're very direct but there's like three or four big gigantic companies and they're just cheese also yeah so there are two big competitors both of whom have private equity overlords one competitor also puts quinoa brown rice and oat bran in it so it's cheaper and it tastes more like a cracker for reference we're usually ranked in like the mid 300s on all of amazon grocery they're ranked in the 18 000 range well all that matters is your sales tell us about your business sure so last year we launched first year in existence we did three and a half million in sales hello wow year to date we are already at 3.7 and we still have four months of the year live and how many stores are you in 700 stores right now plus 1300 from a prominent convenience store chain 7-eleven i got my first pos today what so what you did 3.5 million year-to-date out of only 700 stores and amazon so plus yeah break that down i will back up because i think chronology will help and you always were to keep an eye on the family business so we had been tinkering around after we saw wisps so we talked to my dad about it and said hey we used to do something similar back in the 90s for the atkins craze when the atkins craze died the product crater so we looked at relaunching it and my wife had the foresight to spot the keto trend and when keto took off we were pretty much the only game in town so did you raise any investment nope this family has self-funded how much did you put in to get to this point we've probably invested a total of maybe a million dollars what does it cost me to make what do you wholesale it for so at our current volume 95 cents and what do you sell it for dollar 27 retailing for 1.99 depending on the skew we make between 17 and 20 percent that's it when we wholesale it to a brick-and-mortar store it's 25. that's terrible margins what what's the plan to make more margin on so if i sell 40 000 boxes a month and what what's that volume yeah it would be 75 cents per at a dollar 27. so my margin increases substantially as i grow if there's ever a royalty deal this is it look there's no way he's in stores everywhere lori i'd like to make an offer thank you hey look i don't have a cheese provider in my portfolio i have a lot of wine wine cheese you kind of get what i'm talking about here i'll give you the 500 000 and i want a a 20 cent royalty per bar which is good silence while i make an offer he can decide whether he wants to take it or not i don't need the noise from the cheese factory right here i'm trying to i'll give you the 500 000 for a 20 cent royalty and i will give you tremendous marketing leverage on this because i think this could be a fantastic business if you can get more distribution with all due respect i think that that piggy backs off the hard work we've already done but i can add a lot of value here bringing this into my portfolio and making you a shark tank company and our interests are totally aligned i'm only asking for a little cheese on my beak every time we sell a bar look i think you've done an amazing job getting it out there i think you're probably one of the fastest zero to million plus in sales we've had on the show but i don't like the taste of it it's not a knock on it it's just a personal thing for me yeah so you know only for that reason i'm out but i congratulate you on the success i think kevin's offer smells i think he cuts the cheese i was waiting for someone to go there david here's my thoughts i think you have a superior brand but farmers of cheese are looking and shopping around to see who would like them to make these products so there's going to be more entrance i just don't think there's space and i'm up okay so i like your packaging a lot i think it's really smart it's really good but i'm seeing so many places ads for things that are competitive and i'm not sure who's going to wind up being the leaders in this and for half a million dollars at 5 i don't feel solid enough to invest so i'm out okay i'll give you another angle and this is what dawned on me at a 10 million dollar valuation even if you sell the company for 50 million dollars and i get five times my money my total upside is 2.5 million over 500 000 that's not enough for the risk that's involved i just don't see a way to overcome that so for those reasons i'm out all is not lost because the yellow cheese road leads back to mr wonderful four sharks are out david has one offer on the table for his cheese snack company just the cheese david to be clear i give you half a million dollars i ask for 20 cents a bar as a royalty i get no equity in perpetuity absolutely how else am i going to do this deal perpetuity is a very long time it's a word i like so how flexible are you in the royalty fee itself and the term of the deal i'm not negotiating against myself i'm trying to come up with a reasonable deal on the fly i just gave you one david make a counter here i'll help him i'll give you half a million dollars for 15 cents a bar still perpetuity what are you going to suggest so i'd like to make a reasonable offer so i'd like a pen and paper because i don't want to make an offer that's insulting to any of you here you go so if you were going to take 20 cents a bar yeah you would get 360 k based on my amazon sales from last year yeah that seems for lack of a better word nuts well i'm looking at a nickel [Music] a nickel in perpetuity nope 10 years a nickel for 10 years wait how many bars did you sell last year last year on amazon i did 1.8 million individual packages well i'm sticking at 15 cents until i recoup 750 000. with all due respect that puts too much short-term cash flow stress on the business i can't be siphoning more and more cash out so david david i'll offer you 500 000 i want 15 no royalty yes or no so while i respect both kevin and laurie's offers i'm out you're out oh you're out now now you have two offers what do you want to do with all due respect i do appreciate that you were the first to give me an offer yes but i'm going to have to decline i made that offer because of the tie i like it so back to me david 15 is high for me so i would ask if you'd consider seven and a half no because there's got to be enough upside for me it needs to get the scale in order for it to be worth anything to anybody and the difference between eight percent in equity if we get it to scale is buckets it's a reasonable offer but i'm going to politely and respectfully say no fair enough we wish you the best david it was an interesting ride it was a pleasure guys thank you so much [Music] i'm feeling a little disappointed my wife my family everyone who pours their heart so into making such a great product so i'm disappointed for them that i couldn't bring home a deal but i hope they're proud of me anyway you ", "Plop Star": "[Applause] next up is a convenient and discreet solution to an embarrassing [Music] problem oh wow the entrance on the throne oh my gosh Game of Thrones hello sharks I'm Tyler J and I'm seeking $150,000 for a 10% stake in my company plop star sharks I know we just met but I want to talk to you about how you poop like a lot of people if I wasn't in the privacy of my own home I wasn't comfortable going number two because of the smell I might leave behind traditional bathroom aerosols just mask the stench leaving a sticky film behind and a bathroom that smells like a stinky rose garden and all these new drops and sprays used before going number two are cumbersome leak in a purse in a pant pocket so I invented wait for it plop star the world's most discret and portable toilet odor eliminator each plop star tablet is individually wrapped for ideal portability so how does pop star work just gently drop one tablet in the Bowl before your performance wait a few seconds before taking a seat popar starts dissolving instantly releasing a buffer of essential oils on the surface of the water that block bathroom Motors before they begin so sharks which one of you wants wants to partner with us and start a movement so quick question on the advance technology when when you when the excrement goes below the surface the the odorous gases are trapped underneath the oil film surface is that the idea can I pass out some samples real quick we like to see yes samples please yes oh you're bringing us water we can all plop okay thanks buddy are there different flavors or just one plopper there's just one plopper so far we just go ahead plop it in yeah plop it in give it a drop thank you thank you sir plop plop welcome like you were in the laboratory let's see what that's oh it smells good yeah it smells like the vitamin C tablet it smells refreshing yeah there are several things that I know one I'm a man who likes to leave his Mark unbelievable no two I'm out with prejudice that's the greatest out I've ever seen this has six packets in it what does it sell for all right so we have two units right now the six-pack is called the Weekender we sell that for $4.99 and then our 30 pack is $12.99 what's your what are your sales like right now we have $122,000 in sales oh your consumer doesn't seem to be loving this thus far or doesn't seem the need no I I think what it is is and why I'm here is because I really wanted to build the back the manufacturing make sure that we had all our nuts and bolts before we kind of started you improve demand that's the reverse order of what should happen here well because you're asking me for 1.5 million valuation 150,000 10% and all you got is 12,000 in sales I don't know if anybody really wants plop star I'll tell you guys a little bit about my my backgr yeah I worked at large advertising firms and 5 years ago I actually started my own production company been incredibly successful I do broadcast spots for large corporations advertising PR and also direct to Tech firms and I wanted to create a product something that I could create the content for that looks super professional at a cheap rate and I kind of had my aha moment a couple years ago and my little daughter she loves making bath bombs and I was like wow this would be the perfect form factor makes so that was my big aha moment there is a 800 PB gorilla in this market I I guess I'll say it's poopery yeah of course and it's a $300 million brand they did $ 56.5 million it's a growing category the convenience of not having to carry a bottle it's Innovative and listen I Squatty Potty is my investment correct and everybody laughed at little stool that helps you I believe in toilet in portfolio but they have just hit 160 million in sales 5 million squatty Patty sold so you know this could potentially fit within my family of entrepreneurs and The Squatty party what you've created here is interesting I think that you've made the form factor convenient and I don't think that the target audience for you is B Toc and consumers because when people go to other bathrooms there's a mindset that's absolutely bizarre they have no respect so you kind of need to Target a business to business model where that people who are working in hotels or public restrooms they like I could drop this every time because it's the guy before and after me that destroys the place but don't you think it's a little bit expensive to sell the businesses that's the problem right there because it is pricey I mean they like industrial big huge gallons of things and you know the cheapest can be because they're just pouring it down a toilet and they don't care yes um the B2B model I don't believe is going to work not for a second but here's what we see again and again on Shark Tank which always disturbs me it's your approach to business right I see you as a cautious respectful intellectual guy very bright assessing analyzing figuring out how you're going to do you get it right you're going to get all the pieces in place but you forgot to take it out to Market and see if there's even a demand there I don't believe there's a demand for this product so I'm out okay you should flush it down the fraking toilet I'm not kidding this is going nowhere this is going to be a zero pop star sucks I'm out it's a bad idea Tyler Tyler there's a lot of competition in this area so I just don't feel it's investable for me so I'm out you're out well can I just tell you I have a 10 and 8-year-old and I love them I've been working relentlessly after hours to make this work and like my son he just goes Dad this is so cool that you're building something that's physically tangible and bringing it to Market I actually quite like your idea by the way W what you created here is interesting but where I struggle is you don't have a game plan I feel if I give you that 150 can I tell you what I do you're going to flush it because there's no plan behind it I do have a plan it's B2B it's the Omni Channel making sure if we could get into retail you see but that's not a plan so right there look I I love your energy but you said I want to go B2B great and then oh an omni Chanel and Retail it's too many ANS I'm sorry but I'm out all right plop starts over all right take the bar thank you so very much take care thank you Tyler do the right thing you're riding back out on that you guys have a good one thank you so much I really appreciate it congrats Tyler good luck he's he's coming in and going out was the best part I think the sharks made a big mistake by not investing in plop star I think you're going to see us everywhere and I really do want to prove all of them wrong and go man I should have got in on with them wait you're not subscribed to the Shark Tank Youtube channel well then for that reason I'm out ", "Kronos Golf": "[Music] next up are entrepreneurs who believe they've designed a finer more functional piece of golf equipment [Music] hi sharks my name is eric williams creative director at chronos golf and i'm philip lapooz founder and designer at chronos golf we're seeking 150 000 for a 15 stake in our company we're an indie putter company that manufactures the most precise putters in the world you might have heard the phrase drive for show and putt for dough honey accounts for half the shots of an average golfer so why are we blowing our money on drivers and shoddy putters that is where chronos comes in we mill our putters down to one one thousandth of an inch to make sure our putters are perfectly balanced we start off with a solid block of steel and mill it for over two hours transforming it from stage one a solid block of steel to stage two a roughly milled putter to stage three a more refined build putter it's a slow labor-intensive process but it's the right way to make a well-balanced putter from there each one is individually hand worked including delicate deburring polishing and painting all the while preserving that critical balance the truth is there's no putter out there that'll make you better overnight but ours will help you put more consistently and that might be the only difference between winning and losing plus they're super sexy so let's get the devil on the dance floor and give these putters a try kevin can we ask you to come on up here all right let's get you a ball now robert note how i'm holding the club [Music] should we duck kevin i'm i'm feeling one with the ball at this moment watch this go in [Music] wow wow phil your premise was an awful golfer like kevin would be better with your putter here's what we believe in a lot of people believe that they can buy their way into golf or another sport whatever it is they're looking for some sort of technology to save them and the appreciation for the practice and the work that goes into it ends up being lost for that reason what you're seeing here are putters are simplistic and they refer to older time would you agree they're fairly simple it all comes down to the milling process how do you get your story out yeah deal with the distribution problem okay i'll answer okay i want to buy a chronos and i'm sitting in new york right where do i go about two years ago we went to the pga show and we got distribution for japan and scotland but nobody stateside was interested they're interested but there's that issue of people believe that they need approval from a pro it's a proven model that's how people sell golf products what are your sales just year to date we've done 260 thousand dollars and we've done 95 of that to japan they really understand the crowd why is it working in japan do you have your own displays no it's this is that brand there's a different psyche in japan than in america we've talked about america they look for that validation in a pro player in japan they have a long history of art and the delicacy that goes into creating things and on that level they appreciate what we create at value it cost relative to a normal how face putter so our cheapest putter sells for five hundred dollars can i see one wait wait wait let's discuss the name for a second okay i happen to be an expert in greek mythology okay excellent thank you so you know that kronos he took a sickle and he castrated his father and threw them into the ocean i'm aware of that now what would that have anything to do with a putter so kronos's time his reign was called the golden age we want to go back to the golden age of golf that's why we're wearing this attire hang on a sec everything you're talking about once i feel it and look at the weight of it i mean it's it's a lot better than any other standard putter oh why couldn't you get distribution here in the u.s we could advertise and say that we've got the greatest putters you have to give a free putter to every single pro shop that's a huge thing or at least to the people on the pga yes that's the only problem to get a pro it's just how much do you want to pay them right eric 500 it sells for at retail tell me what it costs you to make and tell me what to sell to the stores sure cost roughly is about 120 per club to make well we sell them wholesale for around our cheapest one is 200 to 230. how much money have you raised so far none it's really my money i worked in consulting before this and how much money did you put into it we have about a hundred thousand dollars into it guys let me get things rolling here um have you ever heard of dallas national no i might not it's one of the nicest courses in the country it opened in dallas probably 10 years ago and one of my friends you got to join you got to join i joined 10 years ago i've never been because i hate golf for that reason i'm out oh man but i wish you guys the best and congratulations has nothing to do with you guys one thing that we touched on i among everybody up here should love this sport more than anybody else because it saved my marriage it gets rid of my husband every weekend but i hate golf i couldn't imagine supporting it i'm out all right thank you thanks so last year we did something in japan which helped our sales a lot but how you haven't solved the distribution problem for the us [Music] there are cases where something catches fire in golf and everybody buys it sure i mean lightning strikes and maybe it could strike you but it's a long shot [Music] two sharks are out philip and eric only have three more chances to make a deal for their hand-crafted putter company chronos there are cases where something catches fire in golf and everybody buys it sure but it's a long shot you know what i think your message is clear quality old time beautiful elegant you if you want to keep that upscale craftsmanship if that's what's important then you have a niche market that's going to go for that i think japan is the way to go because japan is telling you we love it i'm out tell me a little bit about you guys what motivates you guys to want to start your own business i um i'm engaged to it [Music] because i'm engaged to i'm engaged and my fiance lives in japan and she can't come out here unless i make this happen [Music] i could have discontinued my job as a consultant making fine money but this is my dream why can't she come here and list this word yeah why because i want this to be stable and you can't afford her to come here that's why i'm here today i could wait but i mean i'm oh woe is me like i can't get married but it's like do i have to choose between my company and my dreams and my fiance she's sitting there waiting it's been two years two years since i proposed her and at that time i was working and consulting and her parents approved and now they don't approve they think i'm crazy and because of the because you started a business yeah i i think in their culture they're a little bit more conservative in the sense that they value someone who goes nine to five job or so literally it's hard yeah [Music] it's moving i gotta tell you i think you were to sit tonight and write her parents a thank you note in order to start like this thank you for the insults for not thinking i'm worthy enough for your daughter watch me now and watch what i do there's no better motivation in the world than somebody who insults you those parents are guaranteeing your success and if your fiance doesn't marry you i will marry you move to japan quickly i mean look your your story really moved me i got to tell you it's it's painful listen ask him to put his money where his mouth is that's the challenge that's right if you were crying i was i was moved by that story but now i'm back in reality you know i'd love to figure out how to do this but i think it's it's a very very difficult task you don't want to let emotions make financial decisions and i don't that's what's kept me true as a great investor i'm out phillip you have one eric you have one shark left what are you gonna do look i've in the six years we've been up here here's what i've learned people that succeed in life tend to have a need for something greater than themselves i have a huge chip on my shoulder the guys always make fun of me it always goes back to the need to improve my parents life you have your own drive and that's never going to go away you're always going to work a little harder and and keep going but it takes time you're not going to change the consumer market like this this is going to take time that's the thing that we have that's what i have and i'm willing to put in and i think you know sometimes you make an investment because you see a tipping point my only point to you is there's a tipping point and it's far away it's going to take time to recoup this 150 000 for 35 all right yowie [Music] you mind if we take a second to talk about it sure yes [Music] we'd like to counter it 25 percent i'll meet you in the middle i'll do 150 000 for 30. we just have one last question for you do you want your putter now or later with your name engraved on it because we'd love to do a deal with you all right [Music] how do you say good job in japanese oh man that was crazy you ", "Fried Green Tomatoes": "first into the tank is a business centered around a southern specialty [Music] hi y'all my name is holly cooper owner of fried green tomatoes from nashville tennessee and i'm seeking 200 000 in exchange for 15 equity of my company fried green tomatoes our food truck makes every item fresh to order our bacon lettuce fried green tomato sandwich is the favorite other favorites are grouper sandwich a shrimp po boy we have a catfish sandwich oh yeah but we're known best by visitors from all over the country for our hand-battered fried green tomatoes fried pickles and our secret sauce our products are flying off the shelves in retail stores so sharks this business is ripe with opportunities so who'd like to help spread a little bit of nashville southern hospitality all over the country are y'all hungry okay all right thank you this is from our food truck beautiful thank you holly thank you you are ben thank you holly thank you i don't know if i'll get my mouth around us thank you martha thank you all right oh that's very good holly this is great thank you this is the best part of the job and the worst part of the job so we do a seasonal business of special events however i just purchased a truck that we're going to be taking out for more lunch events our uh food truck it's actually a 16 foot trailer most of our events we're doing 600 to 800 an hour and wow wow wow and we have customers waiting more than an hour to get their favorites really yeah it's fantastic i love it the fried green tomato thing i just inhaled but there's so many food trucks i mean what's the deal well actually it's more than a food truck we have a product that we sell to retailers nationwide which is just right we took that product to market in 2016 we sold in 42 states about 600 stores 600 more boutique stores and we'd like to get into more of the big box stores the batters cost me a dollar 28. they retail for 8.99 what are your sales we we did 268 000 last year good for you so it's all of your sales collectively right so holly tell us about you i was uh in the restaurant business for about 18 years i actually owned a small cafe and actually sold that business and then i got into commercial sales what kind of commercial sales fuel commercial fuel i've also sold plumbing hvac business electrical business awesome wow you should get it right honey i can sell it why did you leave sales to go back into the food business oh i actually i lost my job i lost my job i was the number one sales rep for the company i was number three in the nation and i had just sold a state contract and they let me go so that's why i started my business so i could be in control of my destiny well i'm gonna tell you why they fired you they were jealous of your talent i think so but the beauty is is you can at any point in time take your life and your destiny into your own hands and you can create a business or product and that's freedom and that's success yes what is your aspiration i would love to be able to franchise our food truck you want a franchise and i i've had more than a dozen people want to buy a franchise and i just don't really know how to do that so i'd love some help not to be negative but you know i have to speak the truth i am mr wonderful 200 000 for 15 means your value for business for 1.3 million dollars to pay a million three for this business is very difficult if you had an already established series of franchisees that were making money that makes it more believable that you can pour gasoline on the fire and right make it bigger but you don't have that yet look i think the food's fantastic but it's just too small it's not a vegetable i'm out i understand like i said i've had restaurants and i've i've done more dollars out of a food truck than i've done in a cafe what you've done is really quite amazing and i'm sure you're having a whole lot more fun working for yourself that's exactly right um i loved what i ate but i'm that person that goes for the healthy the light the low fat so the product's not right for me i'm sorry i'm out thank you thank you holly you have 268 000 in sales and that is a combination of the truck as well as the product and retailers yes i actually just brought my daughter on full time uh so with the two of us we can definitely more than double those numbers this year it's nice that you brought in your daughter but in order to really take an investment and accelerate the growth you have to get to that point where okay how can i get to five employees how can i get the ten employees and that's something really that an entrepreneur has to go through i just don't think you're investable yet so for those reasons i'm out but congratulations i remember when the cousins made lobster boys came in here the two cousins the most important question they answered was how much you're doing a day and they had only been in business three months yes and they said 5 000 a day we've done 6 400 a day it's been our top so that's more than 3 million a year if you had your trucks open six or seven days a week all of a sudden barb can do math yes well this kind of math i can do because i know it inside and out you obviously can sell like crazy i can well i am your dream partner okay but i'm gonna have to be very well paid because i can do so much for you and i can make you rich within two years no doubt in my mind oh my lord let me tell you something you can make an empire franchises out of this but the important ingredients that those two cousins have is boy can they sell and boy are they organized as a result of that they have 60 million dollars in sales i know i want to beat them yeah you will be them no doubt in my mind you will be them so i'll offer you the 200 000 for 30 of your business that's a no-brainer no think about it wait a minute now that i saw barbara all over this like a truffle pig on a truffle yeah i'll give you 200 000 for 25 and he doesn't know a damn thing about the franchise stay here stay here and he's a guy i love you i really do what are you gonna do you save five percent on the damon discount yeah barbara could we could we get to 25. look i know is that the experience worth it i'm a genius at this i i really um i really love you guys i love all of you um i think i'm going to take barbs she paid more i'm sorry i love it i'm sorry we got rid of that guy you're so smart thank you thank you too bad damon 200 in the fried food business never trust the skinny person i know i'm your guy congratulations i would have never thought you'd get a deal and you did congratulations ollie he was like taking candy for my baby why didn't you guys want that business it's a gold mine you never know what's gonna happen on shark tank it was worth giving up a little more equity uh to get barbara because i knew that she had the experience to do what we needed and she's the shark i was after and so we're thrilled to have her as a partner you ", "Cookie Kahuna": "next up is a new brand from a cookie Legend [Music] Aloha sharks my name is Wally Amos I'm known as a cookie man yes you are wow oh company is a cookie Kahuna and I am from Honolulu Hawaii asking for fifty thousand dollars a chump change for you guys in exchange for 20 percent [Music] I've been selling cookies for 40 years and for a long time I actually thought I was selling cookies but it occurred to me that I wasn't selling cookies I was selling happiness you you you guys you're not smiling I mean wonderful he looks anything but wonderful I got something to make you smile don't go away [Music] for the show s allergic to cookies you know you guys look the same shocking isn't it this close to the Sharks let me give Lori hers does it matter no it doesn't matter to me Kevin I think I'm a shortcut for you buddy let me get Barbara's in mind give me mine you got yours am I a legend thank you does that mean y'all gonna give me some money no but you are a legend gosh you're as tough as everybody said you were I like them yeah you have a light crunchy cookie it's good yeah I am the Wally Amos who started Famous Amos 40 years ago you are a legend sir oh God yes sir I was so very impressed thank you thank you that's very gracious of you I appreciate that I have a new cookie business which is called the cookie Kahuna I am no longer Affiliated the original company that I started 40 years ago what happened to that company I came to cookies from Show Business years ago I was an agent at William Morris I was the first African-American Asian at William Morris wow I booked Simon and Garfunkel The Supremes Marvin Gaye I did that for a long time I started making cookies 1970 just to share with friends and just to have cookies whenever I wanted to but your cookies were everywhere all over the world they were what went wrong was I'm a damn good promoter but I'm not a business guy and my focus was not on how much money I was going to make I just wanted to have a good time so what happened with the business yeah they're still available the company went through five different owners over a period of time really the time I got down I'd been diluted and I had no equity left I had nothing left they're used I believe your picture on the box my pictures the name Famous Amos yes they did they did they license that from you no they owned Famous Amos right out tell us about the new business I started this oh maybe a little over a year and a half ago we're online I've got my own website and I sell cookies at Costco only in Hawaii what do you sell it for Wally how much does it cost hold on a sec I'm not a business guy but I got my numbers here we like our numbers yeah you love your number you love your numbers like I love my cookies um Costco buys them for 7.89 for a one pound bag how much does it cost you to make them and it costs 5.25 is it 420 for ingredients what were your sales for the last year 36 215.97 for this year so far so can I see the numbers Wally do you mind not at all don't ask me any questions so Wally the margin you're making once you take in packaging shipping and handling is less than twenty percent that's bad it's a food business it's it that's not enough margin to sustain a business you've got to get your costs down what the numbers tell me is your packaging and shipping costs are well over 40 percent of the whole costs including the baked goods no no what just the packaging Wally that's worse than I thought Wally after what you've been through uh starting the business losing the business why would you start all over again because I love cookies and I think that I can build a business out of this cookie and replicate what I did with Famous Amos years ago I'm convinced I can one thing you bring that very few people that have ever come on the tank have had is such a huge brand associated with the food category but we don't have the full access of your image and your name and so it has all the challenges associated with launching a new brand it's not investable not for me anyways okay I'm sorry Wally I'm out that's cool no problem thank you thank you I'm a product person I've been in the product arena for 18 years and I've worked with a lot of entrepreneurs and one of the things that's the hardest conversation I ever have to have with them is about if they find that something isn't working to go to something else and I'm sure because you have that Spirit you're a promoter you have so much inside of you that there are other things that you could be doing with as much passion I understand I understand what you're saying because of that struggle I have to be out I understand that I accept all of that sure everybody knows your cookie you're you're a solid entrepreneur it's good to love the product it's really important to love the business your cost is too high you have limited distribution I'm sorry I'm out best of luck that's cool yeah accept that thank you man yeah thank you I have a similar story to you if not for a lucky break I would have had the exact same thing happen in my business I was in business about 10 years and I had a terrible turn in the market and lucky for me just when I thought I might go out of business Merrill Lynch came in and they offered me fifty thousand dollars they not only wanted me to sign away Corcoran Group which was my brand but they wanted me to sign away Barbara Corcoran for me where I was seated then right fifty thousand dollars was the equivalent of having God himself come down and kiss me I can relate and at the 11th Hour they changed their mind and didn't buy it and that same business I sold for 66 million dollars 15 years later how lucky for me that they changed their mind yeah you know the universe is filled with surprises it's true but here's what went awry here when you sold your business you not only sold the name but you sold your personality along with it without that the business has very little value Barbara what are you going to do she's not she's going to pass yeah I'm going to pass but with great respect well you're a Legend um I've learned from your story the bet the good and the bad and it taught me a lot my problem is I'm already in the cookie business so it'd be a conflict for me no question so I'm out but thank you stay tuned you'll watch me selling I have no doubt no doubt come on Wally you gotta go aloha guys I know that this was just another step in my journey Kahuna is going to be more famous than Famous Amos so you guys know the whole story of Wally it's it's an amazing lesson so business was great he was the first like high-end cookie that got distributed in grocery stores and then that brought in some competition and so business started to decline and so he went out and got an investor but he still you know said he said okay just give me the money that'll fix it all it did it and every time he lost equity and burned through the cash he raised more money so he kept on getting diluted until it was nothing what I did love about him is he was 80 years old yesterday he still had to drive how many of us he had a personality yeah you look great for 80 Robert come on before you go don't forget to subscribe to the Shark Tank Youtube channel and click on that notification Bell to keep up with everything that's

polin sarah's mom cao chief anxiety officer we're here from washington dc and we're asking for 500 000 for 10 of our company oh wow sharks as most of you know most commercially available soup is not as healthy as you might think i mean why do we need a phd to read the ingredient list i mean really sarah what is we are gum what monosodium glutamate and mechanically separated chicken i don't even know okay at supergirl we have cracked the code to the perfect soups our soups are all natural they are hand crafted brimming in plant-based protein and fiber and really really low in salt and fat and they're bursting in fresh vegetables everything your doctor says you should be eating and the soups are delicious yeah the proof is in the numbers my numbers my cholesterol used to be 2 20 and now it's 170 and dropping sharks what started off as a small local soup delivery business has organically grown into something much bigger and now it's time for the rest of the country to be eating our soups you guys ready for this you want to try something try some soup we've got some great soup for you bring it on okay sir thank you you're welcome okay so what we have here is our chilled watermelon gazpacho in the bottle we also have a west african peanut stew we have our summer minestrone curried red lentil peach and we have an indian style mama katani the curry peach is fantastic what's your background well we have been doing this since 2008. back in 2008 i was a former stand-up comic looking for a good bowl of soup something that hopefully didn't have a ton of salt and fat and i failed miserably so obviously i dragged my poor mother out of retirement yeah so let me i'll tell you the real story because she's starting she doesn't hate somebody she's been lying to us all the time no but i i was in there from the beginning so let me tell you um by definition yep she's a great bubby i can tell i think the problem started when we launched and i found our first kitchen she said to me ma i got this great kitchen we're gonna cook in it was a dungeon literally a dungeon you had to go downstairs there was no air conditioning in the summer we were schnitzing in the winter i heard a squeak squeak it was a mouse and i said i am out of here no she said no you're not you're staying and i stay because sarah is so determined and so i stayed i've been here for 10 years but congratulations the product is really good so you passed the first test thank you however yes now we get down to the numbers and quickly i must say five hundred thousand dollars for ten percent imputes a five million dollar business i love the soup but you better sell a lot of it so give me the sales well let's talk about 2016 1.4 million one wells in 2017 2.4 million very good we're on thank you and now we have two retail locations we're in almost 50 natural food locations and 20 box stores the consumer demand for this product is expensive what did you make last year on that two four how much you're doing about five percent ouch i'll tell you why sarah honey sweetie poopsie those are terrible margins hit our capacity and i had to make a decision am i going to stay where we are as a small local dc business or i'll tell you why we can't get a cobra or are we going to take this nationwide and here's how we're very quickly going nationwide meet the super meals program okay what we do is we deliver three day or five day program so the three day has 12 soups and the five day has 20 suits people will have all day every day well or or you can customize the program you have this program running we've run it on a small level we've done about nine hundred thousand dollars in sales i know that model i ship stuff in jars let me tell you what it costs how much for the three day program it costs fifty dollars to make and we sell it for 99 and that includes shipping that's not a good margin here's the tragedy no no no numbers are numbers let me get the numbers up you made twenty thousand dollars a five percent okay on the 2.4 you're priced the business at a 5 million valuation sarah that's a 41 multiple on a soup business no soup for you sarah on the planet earth during the planet's history has anybody ever paid 41 times how do you know that i know that because i know everything okay and there's no way you're gonna get that here today here's the here's the thing do you believe that you're gonna um net more and increase more than five percent over your net yes my fixed costs are quite high because of this new case well that goes back to the co-packer you were going to say why you didn't want to use it okay so there's two reasons why we don't want to use a co-packer number one we're certified kosher and there are kosher there are kosher co-packers not that can do this quality trust me we've talked to them so sarah you you won't let your baby go because you think you're the only person that can make this quality and that's costing you five to six percent soup is horrible when they're cooked in that but just for you if they'll let you be there as they put in those giant colanders but they're doing it wrong nobody does this nobody does what you're trying to do exactly do you have any uh loans or debt yes i have 640 000 in small business loans that i'm paying down you see what's happening here right you keep on needing cash yes and you're hoping that you'll make it up in volume you have retail stores and you have subscription right when i see somebody going after that many outlets that means they're not completely confident in any one i'm sorry i want to hear a little bit about how you're going to use that 500 000 let's set aside the fact that your valuation is ridiculously high the website that we're building everything that we've learned from uh our super meals program that we've done over the past year we're going to integrate into that website so auto renewal subscriptions refer automated it already exists you don't need to know how much you think you're gonna have to pay to get that done yeah about a hundred thousand dollars no that's about right and then i want four hundred thousand dollars for equipment to optimize my because my staff costs are going to come down my staff costs are still too high sarah you are literally at risk of going out of business and i don't think you realize and know it [Music] sarah you are literally at risk of going out of business and i don't think you realize and know it you see what's happening here right you keep on needing cash you are so capital intensive right yes perfection is the enemy of profitability amounts i appreciate all your feedback gave me a lot to think about how much cash do you have in the bank right now um about twenty thousand dollars oh oh that's okay wait no no it's receivable you have to service right now 640 000 of debt the business is worth about 750 000 right now less the debt so it's worth about 100 and you know change that's the truth that's what a buyer would give you for it i'm out you would have to do a hundred million dollars to make five million dollars i would get 10 of that you would have 200 million just for me to get back 500 000 i mean think about that for that reason i'm out sarah first of all i think we're being way too dire about your business no i would never count you guys out right you're gonna do 3.4 million dollars you obviously have a sense of what it is to sell your product but i don't think at the moment it's a big business and i can get a big return on it so for those reasons i'm out i appreciate that after why are you encouraging her on you know the mom you know what you know what you know what i know the mom of somebody i encourage because i think at the end of the day i think they're going to figure it out don't take any encouragement from that are you i know are you going to are you going to leave leave the show and reflect about whether or not to go uh with a co-packer sure i'm absolutely going to reflect children if you want to do it are you in i don't want you to glorious any encouragement from matthew's comments because you still have a 50 50 chance of going to zero okay i hate when he says that but in this case he might be right okay i think the super girl logo and name is fabulous thank you it's very cute it's very memorable there's one thing that for me is not great five percent profit margin our profit margin used to be much bigger but when we opened up this new facility of course it went down but it is a problem but that's a huge problem great soup but as an investor i'm out [Music] good luck guys thank you thank you appreciate the feedback thank you it's very delicious see you bubby the soups need to be perfect a super mom and super girl stand behind every unit of suit that goes out the door and that's never gonna change i don't seriously she's in trouble but entrepreneurs do that all the time perfection perfection but only i can do it only i can do it what this was this was dead soup boiling you ", "ROQ Innovation": "[Applause] next up is a stylish and functional way to bring more light into your life [Music] hi sharks my name is raquel graham and i'm

i've shown you the light who is going to show me some money so i have samples for you guys whoo that is bright yes that is bright yeah it's 140 lumens i don't know if that means anything to you guys it does that's a nice way to wear it what because you haven't cut to the side [Laughter] how do these things work peter's about to knock over at 7-eleven where are you selling them i'm i'm on a home shopping network you are is that your only mode of selling and what have you sold there okay the lifetime company is uh 2.4 million good for you for that that's so impressive for headlights i did 1.1

thousand dollars for 50 but then you get run over by a bus in chicago in the winter what happens don't worry every entrepreneur that he talks to he talks about getting run over by a business i only ask that of a single person because there's one just ask her if she's got keyman insurance do you have keyman insurance that means if you if you get run over by a bus i get paid big royalty do you have a patent i have a patent pending so how long has it been pending it's been pending since 2018. why is it pending so long i don't know did you ever get office actions back um no well yes i did um during right before covet and then it got delayed raquel raquel i can't i'll not sit here and be honest i feel like you're a little bit all over the place you're a great designer you're a great endorser but from a business perspective there's a real disconnect and i think what you really need is a supercharged entrepreneur to make this happen for you no no no no no no and that's wrong because all the things all of the things this is my point all of the things you're talking about patent you don't really know the detail you've not chased it up she's the one she's still selling she's still selling and making money she's an individual entrepreneur yeah but she doesn't want you arguing i've got good news for you raquel i'm gonna make you an offer okay thank you the noise on the sides you don't have to listen you can listen to my offer okay very you are a bit of a crazy chicken just let's lay it out there okay i get it but i like crazy chips like crazy i know why is he calling you a crazy chicken you're not a crazy here's the deal i'll give you the 200 000 i don't want any equity at all i'm gonna take two bucks a hat as a royalty until i got my 200 back then it drops down to a dollar a dollar forever of course is it ever and ever i have no equity so of course i get a dollar forever yes even after she's dead okay okay can i say something because this crazy chicken thing i like the crazy chicken but no i don't like the grain in 2016 i i got the call from hsn let's say that was march by the summer i had become really ill and when i say really ill i was misdiagnosed for three months it turned they told me i had pneumonia it wasn't pneumonia it was fungal pneumonia and i had been misdiagnosed for so long it leaked into my uh my leg and i couldn't walk wow so i immediately went into quarantine because they didn't know if it was ebola or whatever and they had to treat it aggressively in two days i had a full stroke i had lung failure twice and um and i was on a ventilator for almost a month and i went in august 26 came out the end of september and i launched on hsn in november so i'm not a crazy chicken that's right i'm really driven and i wasn't going to leave my kids so i do a lot by myself but i know i can improve in some things you championed over adversity that's good good for you and frankly i understand why that bothered you and frankly it would have bothered me too so i'm not here to speak up for kevin you know when he says that he's saying it in an affectionate way raquel that's a journey you just took me on it's quite a lonely world being an entrepreneur and when you're on your own and i understand where that might have triggered you from every single door that has no entry on it has a door behind it and you've found that door and you have a chance now to change your life forever i can help you sell this all over the world not just in the u.s i'm gonna make you an offer i think my offer is far more wonderful than mr wonderful never nobody gets a better deal than mr wonderful guests i can tell you that my offer is the 200 000 for 25 of your business it's a good offer you want to give up equity you don't have to i'm i'm not a fan of royalty into perpetuity i am see she is smart so um what you've done here is really quite amazing but i actually did something with someone that was a light in a cap for barbecuing and because i i concerned it would be a conflict with them is the sole reason why i am out on this but i love the product i love you and i'm so glad you're doing so well thank you yeah raquel i wish it was something where i could really add a lot of value because clothing is just not my thing um so congratulations on what you've accomplished but for those reasons i'm out i most likely would have given you an offer but i think the biggest challenge i have is that you didn't get the patent in a certain amount of time i think somebody else out there is going to try to block you because the gift and curse of being on the stage is now everybody's going to know you and now everybody's going to come out the woodwork so i think you have a good offer on the table and i'm going to step out i'm out however you have two valid offers on the table what are you going to do but let me tell you a little bit about me i've been sitting in a chair like this for a long time and i have to say i've been blown away by you because i also know what it's like to go through difficulty i started my first business at 16 things lit up for me and i was definitely young and naive and by the time i was 28 i lost everything literally everything but it was the best thing that ever happened to me because the lessons that i learned from previous i could now invest in over 50 different companies globally i think that this could be huge thank you i'm happy also to let mr wonderful into my deal having a bit of equity is also nice if we're going to like this a little cash flow peter i like a little royalty action but we could have a bit of both if you want to share i would love to do that you could have mr wonderful and mr global yes i've just made that up by the way i don't know where i like it i like it okay why not this deal i'll come in 50 50 with you and we get a royalty of a dollar and it goes away after let's say we get six hundred thousand back what about that so it's not actually you don't have to worry about that are you talking to me and what equity could we have you talking to me i stay with the 25 what about if we drop to 20 have 10 each yeah i do that what about that raquel you could have i've lost track you could have mr wonderful and mr global yes we could have 20 for 200 000 okay and we've got a royalty is that yeah just so we get some cash flow to get our capital back but i have a question can you explain when you have a royalty into perpetuity no it's not she he only kills that okay i'm listening again with mr global coming in all right and he asked me to get rid of the perpetual aspect of it okay so what happens is we get the royalty until we recoup six hundred thousand so three times on our money then it goes away forever and we're your partners we just want some liquidity [Music] deal congrats raquel inspiring [Music] thank you you ", "Bertello Pizza Oven": "[Applause] next up is an easier way to achieve authentic Italian [Music] flavor hi sharks my name is Andy Burke this is my brother Eric we're seeking $120,000 in exchange for 10% of our company forell shars do you like a pizza sharks you know what's even worse than what my grandfather Vinnie would think about my fake Italian accent it's the quality of homebaked Pizza in a conventional oven I mean let's be honest it's complete garbage now imagine baking authentic Neapolitan style wood fired pizza at over 900\u00b0 in your own backyard introducing Brello wood fire and gas outdoor pizza of our oven has multiple fuel options you can use the propane burner attachment or you can use wood kindling what that's not all sharks you can also use lump charcoal what but wait there's more he can use wood pellets oh wow what and with our patent Pena design you can use wood with gas at the same time what so Sharks next time someone asks you to take a bite out of a frozen pizza or a takeen baked pizza cooked in a home conventional oven forget about it [Applause] oh so sharks let's do a deal capish oh my God are you are you going to do the pitch like that very good very good great bad theater very good bad theater wow oh yes and my chopped liver where's my pie we' like to invite you up Kevin you C pizza with us oh my God are you cleaning up you going to make a pie is that the idea yes yes wow that's really good really good see how I'm doing this out of the skill a little bit more now I want to put a little cheese on pepperon is great thank you very much I'm going to do combination put some pepperoni down on here all right so you're going to want to shake it back and forth to get it moving don't worry I'm skilled at this all right oh beautiful so how long am I waiting to take my pie out uh you want to rotate it every 20 to 30 seconds I already know that all right how many minutes per Pizza up to two Max ma 2 minutes great for a party I think I'm almost done right yeah you could rotate it thank you you're burning it he should have rotated a little carbon with my pizza nothing wrong with that yeah now that's what I'm talking about beautiful is that done matter of preference good job Kevin thank you I'm taking this with me Robert's eaten his entire one nice it was so good this is really good thank you very much really really really good is there anything on the market like this now we do have one competitor but they do not have the ability to use wood with gas at the same time and they don't have as many fuel options as us what's the advantage of using wood and propane as opposed to just wood or just propane so with the propane you can preheat the oven so you just heat the oven up 5 minutes before you're going to cook throw some wood in get the flame rolling it's just faster yeah faster and easy is this allowed to be used indoor I would not generally recommend using indoor it be similar to using a gas grill inside how much does it cost it's 250 what's that's it what does it cost you to make 84 landed wow what's your net margin so our our net is 33 so guys where are you selling it how much have you sold we're selling on Amazon this year we've done 640,000 wow we've done 400,000 in the last 3 months good for you so how much money have you guys invested have you taken any outside investors any debt we have probably $90,000 into it um we borrowed $70,000 at the beginning of the year uh and just paid all of that back that's the inventory good for funded yeah for for inventory is it just the two of you alone in the business yes so 50/50 Partners 8020 what's the story you guys chefs yeah so I'm actually a licensed structural engineer I've been that makes sense I've been working in Manhattan for uh 10 years doing bridge design and Bridge inspection so I'd climb to the top of all the biggest Bridges around Manhattan climb to the top of them climb to the top verizo Queensboro Bridge Williamsburg Manhattan Bridge dang I'm in finance right out of college College I went down I worked in the biggest open outcry trading pits since then moved back to Minnesota wife kids and work in financial services so did you actually design this or did you have someone else do it with you I did everything what's been the largest obstacle you've had to overcome um really is just uh keeping up with the the demand a nice FR so we would have to wait um to get money from our current order to put money down for the next order why would you want to build your own pizza oven when there's at least five that I know exist what is the personal motivation to say forget the five that are already in the market I'm going to go and try and get share with a new yeah no I go for it I think big when I was 10 years old I started building a treehouse and I made probably the biggest treehouse in the entire United States you're an engineer like a Ewok village massive I worked on it from age 10 until I was like 23 years old which discipline dedication that's being all in and I look back at it now and I realize I have a certain quality I'm just get super passionate about whatever I do and I'm I'm obsessed with it guys look what you've accomplished is great your margins are good you're selling through the challenge is you're still just a consumer product it's just not a business I just want to get attached to but I'm not that guy who like let's heat up the grill you know and let's go build make some pizza in the backyard so um it's just not a fit for me so for those Reasons I'm out no problem thank you Mark congrats guys when you came out I was really excited obviously I love the pizza but I don't know I'm sitting here I'm not excited about it for some reason I don't know whether it's there's so much competition I'm not seeing the connection between the Andy and Eric pizza show the oven and how are you going to go to mass market and for that reason I'm out I think it's a beautifully designed oven but I'll tell you what I can't get here when you did your dog and pony show I mean we were like jumping in our seat and then you got hit with a pizza and then everything changed are you still recovering for that what what's happened your energy really went no really what's happened I'd love you to address that because that's my main point of concern two sharks are out Barbara may be interested in Eric and Andy's Woodfired Pizza Oven berell but she is concerned about their lack of energy no really what's happening I'd love you to address that because that's my main point of concern oh yeah no I'm super energetic but um yeah absolutely even the way you said that wasn't energetic I'm super energetic me talk like that's the boy I'll talk like this I can talk like this no but now it feels like an act I know before it felt like you now it feels like an act it's bad theater but what about that I mean I'm matching the the tone and energy of the room Barbara what he's saying is you're putting him to sleep no I mean I love it's an odd thing because usually I buy into products that I'm not that crazy about the product and I love the entrepreneur yeah and I do very well with it I've never been mistaken when I follow my heart on the entrepreneurs but I I really I don't think I've ever been in a position where I love the produ I live eat sleep and breathe this this piece of it I uh work on this 7 days a week 2 47 I happen I think it would do very well in retail it doesn't take up a lot of space the price point is good it looks luxurious I'm absolutely open to that option we've been the best an offer I'll give you $120,000 but I need 25% could you do I also have an offer I'd get behind this as Chef wonderful and sell a lot of it because I'm an amazing chef but I want more um it's really it's you Eric and a bunch of money required for invent and probably more optimization on digital that you've never done okay um but I want 30% if I get behind this the numbers will be up tfold would you do it for 25% yes well we' love to take a [Music] deal I don't believe it I won't step in that but i' got to be don't congratulations guys thank you you like that woo we got the same offer from Barbara and Kevin but we went with Kevin because he believed in us from the start and he made an offer right away Barbara wasn't sure Barbara you said to him he had no energy hard to get a deal when you call somebody boring maybe well you're you're right about that but that proves that they didn't recover from that I like I hope you lose all your money I hope you lose your money why you being so mean Barb I'm being mean cuz I'm annoyed that's why ", "Pricklee Cactus Water": "next in the tank is a beverage that takes advantage of a drought-tolerant plant what's up sharks i'm juan and i'm mo and we're from prickly and today we're here seeking two hundred thousand dollars in exchange for five percent equity of our business who's ready for the next big coconut water uh said no one ever coconut water is played out is this still 2005 get out of here coconut water's time has come and gone allow us to humbly introduce you to mother nature's ultimate thirst quencher with just half the sugar and half the calories of coconut water meat prickly cactus water prickly has no carbonation no stevia and dare we say it no coconuts no mo coco no mo coco cat i plus cac u equals cact us so who's ready to make cactus the new coconut right in front of you we have three samples of our delicious cactus waters let's start with the prickly pear original with hints of watermelon and bubble gum good tastes to me like a watered down pear juice the second flavor that you have in your hand is the strawberry hibiscus this one's nice and the last one is the mango ginger oh wow very gingery this is only 35 calories the whole thing for the whole can how much sugar seven grams of sugar all three of them are great do you guys have a ton of competition like is cactus a thing cactus water is a brand new category there are a few companies that are in that space as well but we have something that others don't so growing up in lebanon my my grandma used to make it from the prickly pear the actual pulp that's in there she used to juice that remove the seeds remove the spines from the outside and we used to drink that as kids growing up i was in a local market in boston and i just saw the prickly pears out of the side of my eye and i just had like a moment of nostalgia just remember my grandma how she used to make this for us so just decided right then and i'm going to take it back home and try to like replicate to the best of my ability so you know we took a sip and immediately we just knew that this was something special okay guys many many beverages coming to shark tank many many many we've had over 13 years many two questions that always have to be answered distribution is next to impossible to get shelf space the weight of the can direct to consumer makes it very expensive to ship so everybody has a huge problem customer acquisition now you're gonna tell us you've solved that problem right because you guys want a four million dollar valuation yeah hopefully you've got some sales absolutely we launched in february and we just had our best month last month at fifty five thousand and we're selling and this month we'll be at this month we'll be at 70 000. so we're selling as far as retail distribution unifi and regional distributors in the northeast so what does one can cost guys and what does it cost you to make so currently it cost us one dollar to make but we have a pathway with our co-packer as well as our ingredient vendors to get it down to 65 cents and that's landed including freight we wholesale for a dollar 67 and they retail 2.99 and new york specifically is more like 349. how does that compare to the cost of coconut water oh it's right in line look i'm a big coconut water drinker and the difference is i get a whole lot more potassium sure and i get a whole lot more of the electrolytes but your nutritional levels are really really low so the differentiator is the antioxidants with with the prickly pear versus the coconut water for example a single prickly pear contains more uh antioxidants than a couple green tea it contains all 24 beta lanes it's got polyphenols taurine and of course a little bit of vitamin c as well we anchor it to coconut water because of the immense work that's done through plant-based water right so the message is cactus is the new coconut because even though 99 of people know what cactuses are we have to give them something that they understand the product with immediately i love the fact that it's coming from cactus most things take a lot of water to grow so i think you're right on the money with something that's important but i think you're a little bit too early and so i am out but i'll be watching you oh thank you so much for your time lauren that's your whole sales pitch tastes great doesn't use water low cost low cal and oh by the way there's antioxidants and you didn't use it at all you should repackage it to something that has to do with saving the country in the world from droughts that's your missing piece so for those reasons yeah no no i agree from sustainability aspect we need to maybe have focused on that a little bit more what we're trying to do from the overall mission perspective is to really change customer behavior and promote sustainable foods guys you know you've clearly got something that's like you know interesting and doesn't seem to be out there but back to mark's point businesses now need to have some kind of purpose right and you actually have that you're just not telling us that you've got it and that's the biggest miss here i wish you the best of luck but i'm out i have to say i invested in a chill soda company going back maybe 10 11 years ago it's where i lost my first two hundred thousand dollars then they did round of investing i lost another two then another two and the reason it was lost was the distribution kill and i learned to respect how dangerous it is and so i don't want to go down that road again so i'm out you know what you're specifically talking about is distribution from a retail perspective the other aspects of other channels they're all out there's only one shark left so let me tell you the way i see it okay i hate beverage deals because of exactly what barb said we've seen them all before and they are just brutal you guys can have a really hard time getting anybody to return your call however i like this product wow i've never done a beverage deal because i hate them so much i hate you less so i'm having a hard time with it because i know if i do this it's it's hell on earth but here's my offer it's a prickly offer you might have a little trouble with it might sting on the edges but it's the only offer i'm going to make and i have no flexibility i'll give you the 200 thousand for twenty percent that's it take it or leave it don't tell me why your other investors be unhappy yada yada you had a woof woof woof i don't care that's the deal thank you so much for that offer can i ask you a quick question sure so just help us understand i mean with your immense experience i mean how how are we supposed to do that right as you know this is a cash intensive business that equity becomes currency for us to raise additional money build our operations team build our sales team to get access into those whole foods until you're making you're making regret this offer i hate this business so much you know if we were to give you 20 of our equity how are we going to return your money in you know four four five years as an investment partner right we want to honor the the faith the only way this works and it's a it's a long shot is you get it to 50 million in sales just on the east coast you can do that and then one of the big guys take you out that's what happens you will never return my question you get acquired we need that equity to raise money to get the 50 million dollar in sales that you want right like i just want to set the stage here's my answer to that if we do this deal i'm going to try and get you more capital from very smart people in distribution it becomes part of my shark tank family and the whole team goes to work on it of course he didn't answer your question did he all i'm all i'm saying is this is we're all going to get deleted together we're all going to get deluded together you really want to get in bed with a guy who doesn't like your business doesn't believe in the business that thinks it's enough are you the one that gave them the offer no i didn't because i don't like them he doesn't like the business he's trying to come in and gobble it up please no you don't have to do it you don't have to do that you you know you guys it wouldn't be what you said from the beginning i was honest with you silence please because he's a bully he bullies his way into these deals i'm just telling you the truth it's so hard that i need a big chunk because i know i'm going to get diluted multiple times as we raise more capital but this deal is not about this it's not about cash right if we want cash we can get the cash right this deal for us is about being first generation americans chasing the american dream and the sacrifice that our parents put in so would you consider the original offer of two hundred thousand dollars at five percent but as a line of credit so we bring you as an advisor as somebody that can bring a ton of value we're giving you investment back um but you have equity in the business you know i i would go down to 10 but i want a royalty i want some way to get my cash back you know what i love your heart and this i would do that for a line of credit and five percent of course because i'd love to see you succeed even though i'd be a sucker for going into another deal like this do it [Music] this is exactly the kind of deal i hate every piece of it thank you so much we're so excited to work with you but it's a compliment it's appropriate for the two of you because i love the two of you thank you congratulations guys thank you guys we just really wanted to protect our equity because we know how much money it's going to cost us to raise in order to grow this business and so we want to make sure that we're fair to the you know barbara and everyone else that's believed in us you ", "Trippie": "proud of you you're so smart oh I'm not I'm you are you work so hard thanks Mom so proud of you okay all right okay you got this okay three all right Mom all right [Applause] Mom next up is an app to help make traveling [Music] easier hello sharks my name is Ryan and I'm the creator of trippy the goto app for navigating big airports I am seeking $100,000 in exchange for 10% equity in my company airports are confusing even for the most frequent business traveler is a college student from Oakland going to school back east at Colgate and a former travel individual basketball player I was always in the airport my typical airport experience always went a little something like this I'd have my carry on bags I make my way all the way to my gate then i' want to grab a bite to eat before my long flight but I had no idea which way to turn for food and you and you know how it is an airport directory is literally never there when you need it and who wants to travel all the way up and down the terminal and search for something that might not be there in the first place so sadly what I have to do a lot of the time is settle for the little new stand by my gate that was Notorious for selling nothing but bottled water and a soggy disgusting tuna fish sandwich little did I know that my favorite Mexican Food Spot was only a 3 minute walk away from my gate with trippy I wouldn't have to settle for this disgusting nasty tuna fish sandwich oh there goes that basketball career that's why I started trippy I'm sorry instead I'd be able to eat the Sumptuous burrito of my dream yeah trippy takes the guesswork and turbulence out of navigating big airports now let me show you how it works great so you're able to select an airport so let select start National as you can see you can get a list of all the restaurants L Fish so right now let's uh select the Shark Tank Diner all right you at the Shark Tank Diner it's only a minute 108 ft away where where deals are made the top dish is the Mr Wonderful special which features extem probably closed by now it went out of business food safety and so now you can see where you are currently in the airport and it shows that that little blue dot is your location and it can guide you all the way to your destination with the arrival of trippy means a departure of your airport stress so we need your help in order to get trippy in the hands of millions of jet Setters worldwide thank you Ryan how many airports do you have today we had four airports up to this point San Francisco Atlanta Chicago O'Hare and Toronto so ever since I graduated 3 weeks ago we actually EXP expanded right now we're in nine airports R are you still trying to finish your burrito yes you go swallow take a minute swallow and then keep how do you keep your information always updated with changes in restaurants particularly menu items pricing so right now it's strictly just the description of exactly what they sell so for example if it's a bar will be like they sell like certain types of beer but like it's not like really as descriptive I'm sorry I still have this burrito that's all right you need some water you have some water back there go ahead I don't have water back there so embarrassing oh there you go there you go oh my gosh thank you thank you Eric oh so embarrassing oh we got time it's only the biggest moment of your life and you're choking on a burrito but what else could go wrong choking in the presentation else Happ welcome back yeah thank you thank you all right Ryan are you a student now yes well I actually just recently just graduated do you have a job conratulations uh I actually turned I turned down a couple jobs opportunities I turned down interviews from Facebook and Google I was my school's Google student Ambassador how do you make money today what do you do for a living so right now this is all that I do I'm I literally like like like can't go 2 seconds without thinking about this you live at home and so yeah I live at home with my parents thanks who coded it I'm the I'm the sole iOS Developer for this oh good for you yeah how long ago did you upload it so I uploaded it to the to the App Store App Store in October do you have any customers yes right now we have only we we have about 850 downloads with 160 monthly active users okay so there are other apps that do this yes right so similar who cares about the competitors why are you better so basically why we're better is the fact that our main goal is not right now trying to be an an airport directory our main goal is actually to connect air Travelers within the airport kind of like a ways of the indoor space so being able to connect Travelers where being able to like TSA wait time that's completely different I mean that's isn't Google Maps doing a lot of that cuz Google Maps has your destination stuff where it'll literally track where you walk in the airport yes we we actually use we actually using the Google Maps API the thing that like differentiates us between us and Google Maps is the fact that we're trying to make a a community of Travelers that basically are are able to communicate with one another Ryan let me ask you something if if for example you were able to get $100,000 here in the tank what would you do with that money my a priority is to get a developer that's better than me to be able to parse flight itineraries to be able to load them into our application wow and since I graduated monthly active users have jumped by 40% to what how many 169 monthly active that's a throw number understand that it's it's very low are you plugged in some kind of a backend system a directory within the airports no we do not and are you adding manually like someone goes there and gets his data how are you getting the information so basically I I work with my my brother who basically helps me with data aggregation from public websites and things exactly from hours reviews all these things and aggregating that into our backend that's tough trying to aggregate that that data essentially manually manually that's hard it is why not tying to the backhand airport systems well because we don't have connections in the we I haven't reached out to the airports you know you said something that I thought was quite brilliant you said you want to become the ways for airports I personally think if you could the biggest problem ever in airports is not knowing what that Line's going to be like when you get there that would be an amazing home run the reason why I didn't come in here pitching that because we don't have that functionality in the application yet I have a lot of ideas to where where to take this application no I totally get that I feel your mind is brilliant and you can get there but for me I like to know something's already even in the works I'm sorry I'm out unfortunately I don't have that rich Uncle unfortunately I I can't raise that friends and family around hey Ryan don't say that don't say you don't have that rich unle don't don't say that look my dad worked in a factory my mom was a receptionist you just got to deal with the reality of what you have you got to be more Innovative that's the beauty of being an entrepreneur you get to create value and then like go with what you have don't look at what you don't have the problem with the app that I see is there's nothing proprietary about it there's no competitive advantage to it but right now I haven't had the opportunity to really I don't want to quash Your Enthusiasm but I'm out and and I would add to that look you you have smarts you have passion I think that even if you hadn't had a ton of downloads even if You' come and say look guys I have a product I haven't gone out there yet but the product has something proprietary to it I would be open to that my problem is at the moment the money you need is to get to the product that's necessary so for that reason I'm All Out R don't don't feel discouraged because there's nothing wrong with you but what we have here is not yet a business we have a confused model so it's too early to come in and ask for an investment I'm out our main goal right now is to be able to build our user base be able to get our users to be able to use this application do you realize how impossible that is and when I said do you realize how many apps have tried to be ubiquitous so they have enough users so that the users can crowdsource information and make it work like ways have or like someone else have look I'm not going to over compliment you I'm not going to just build you up cuz I know this hurts and I can see it on your face how bad it hurts we're only in the iOS store we haven't even we haven't even jumped in my mom can't even download the application how many people in Toronto use your airport about about 20 million a year okay how many people live in San Francisco and use SFO San Francisco who use it about 55 million years what are the other airports Atlanta which is 104 million okay just take those three yes right your potential user base is over 200 million people you have 169 monthly active users it's not the number of airports as a application that's in beta a lot of people believe in us when we pitched last year at Colgate when this was just an idea we had three for of 30 30 CEOs you're lying to yourself to think that you're going to be so differentiated that everybody's going to ignore iOS maps and Google Maps and come to you I'm I'm I get this is hard it's hard to be an entrepreneur I'm saying this to you to try to help the one mistake almost every entrepreneur makes that we have to overcome is we lie to ourselves we tell ourselves that it's a great idea the problem with your idea is it's a feature not a

tough love and then he broke down ", "LiftID": "next up is a technological solution for optimizing brain performance [Music] hi sharks I'm Allison and I'm Ken and we're the brains behind one of the hottest devices in the world we're looking for a 200 000 investment for 10 of our company sharks nowadays everyone is searching for ways to increase productivity focus and performance to get a boost students professionals video Gamers and athletes are all consuming too much caffeine and sugary snacks these chemical stimulants raise the heart rate and travel through the entire body but only a small bit of the stimulant makes its way to the brain what if there were a smarter way to get a similar boost of energy using a new emerging technology well now there is introducing lifted neurostimulation liftage utilizes a process called transcranial direct current stimulation or tdcs our device uses a mild electric current that passes through two electrodes placed on the upper forehead area known as the frontal lobe a part of the brain that when stimulated has been shown to increase Focus attention and memory a simulation session lasts 20 minutes once a day while a user is performing a task like studying for an exam playing a video game or reading a book designed by a world-class Neuroscience team lifted as easy to use lightweight stylish and well positioned to become the coffee of the future sharks who's ready to get productive get focused and get lifted sharks we would love to do a lifted stimulation session with you and it's safe we're not going to get electrocuted it's so safe okay so what you have in front of you is a kit that has everything that you will need to do a lifted uh stimulation session so if you open the kit and you'll pull out the device this device that's the device and you turn it over you'll see there are two black electrodes and what we're going to do is there are sponges right in front of you that are in a saline solution put them inside your electrodes and then you're ready to go I'm going to put this on Allison's head okay and then what do we do okay so then you're gonna put it on your forehead and this is freaking me all right I'm gonna hold mine okay everybody reach for the button press that down for two seconds and you'll hear it beep okay [Music] it's ramping up for 30 seconds I feel like I'm being shocked that's what TDC has it's a little prickly and tingly yeah in my upper teeth too like it stings a little bit I don't feel that same stimulus like with a coffee or anything like is it immediate so this device you are supposed to be doing something to get your brain working and focusing on something and that's how you improve your focus well I'm gonna ramp it down guys how do you know something won't go wrong well first of all PCS is backed by 5 000 published studies they're using it for Alzheimer's Parkinson's any evidence it works epilepsy what is it doing for those things okay specifically the brain has billions of neurons and in those billions of neurons most are dormant so when you're doing a stimulation Set uh session and you're doing like a for example a spreadsheet what's happening is called neuroplasticity that means the more you do that the more those neurons are more likely to fire the next time when all sharks oh this is a notice to all sharks warnings for lifted neurostimulation read along with me sharks do not use if you have any electronic implantic medical device a metal plate in the brain or head a pacemaker or defibrillator do not use the view of epilepsy seizures brain lesions or severe heart disease do not use if you have sensitive skin or a rash broken skin or open wounds such as sores Cuts or pimples do not use while driving drinking operating or Machinery or any situation where you may be impaired has no medical benefit and is not intended to protect or treat any medical condition taking any medical I'm not saying you're making claims but where point is Mark this if it has no medical benefit you know Neuroscience this is for cognitive benefit it's for Focus attention and memory you're very very passionate about this it's clear why are you so passionate about this and why did you decide to do this product I've always had an eye for product I was National salesman of the year for Hasbro at 23 years old also when I was in college I sold solar hats on the streets of DC I introduced General Mills to the two-piece spoon in the lid that was on Colombo yogurt if you remember that I get it again you've got a lot of energy you hear me I just products the shark tank for an investment you won't let the investors talk I've traveled to every trade show in the world I've come to going okay for 30 years I have to ask a question okay please just okay listen Ken how much have you sold of this we have sold 1240 pieces we are here how much do they sell for they're landed for 22 dollars with duty all in and they sell for 149 so how many dollars is that Ken 126 thousand dollars here's the problem for me I have never created or been a part of or invested in any products that make claims that have to do with physical things like you'll lose weight you'll look better I have to feel that I can show efficacy 100 so I steer clear so for those Reasons I'm out Okay I accept the fact that you're a great salesman because you were telling me that but I can't justify the great salesman with the absolutely horrific presentation you did today but but Robert you did nothing but come out here and talk talk right and you were like a machine gun your job is to get me to share that passion and the way you do not do that is just to talk over everybody the nicest thing I can say to you today is I'm out okay I do not doubt for one second that you believe every single thing you shared and it may well be true I cannot connect to stuff and I cannot invest in stuff that I cannot connect to and for that reason I'm out and I appreciate that this is a dream to be here we did this and we're here today and this is a this is a major it's a major home run for us yes silence for one moment I I have a headache and I don't know whether it's you or my session on the lifted I believe you're a great sales guy I really do and you're very passionate that's clear but you're now in the Lexicon of the craziest pitches ever on Shark Tank I can't join you guys that but but Kevin I'm out guys look you tried to sell science without using science and for that reason I'm out good luck we appreciate it thank you bye-bye bye the sharks are going to regret that they did not invest in Lifted it's a multi-billion dollar category and it helps people and we've got that device and we can't wait to keep growing this particular brand lifted is here just before you go don't forget to subscribe to the Shark Tank Youtube channel and ring the notification Bell to keep up with everything that's bubbling in the tank ", "Breathometer": "[Applause] next into the tank is a silicon valley veteran with an innovation he hopes will save lives hello sharks my name is charles michael yim and i'm the founder and ceo of prothometer i'm asking for 250 000 for 10 equity stake in my company so just imagine you're at a dinner party or maybe even a tailgate better yet we're at a local bar with some friends having some champagne would anyone care for a glass yes please sure yeah well i thought you were joking thank you lori here you go thank you damon doesn't like champagne so i'll take his i was told he does there you go thank you damon's favorite drink thank you charles what should we toast to uh pitching to the sharks to you charles thank you sometimes it ends badly though so you know how it goes eat some food you have some drinks before you know it the night's over and it's time to go home and the most important question is are you safe to drive and who would want to carry one of these bulky old breathalyzers around so that's why i created breathometer the world's first smartphone breathalyzer it's so small it can fit in your pocket let me show you how it works simply retract the audio jack plug it into the smartphone activate the app [Music] within a matter of seconds you'll be able to know what your breath alcohol level is and better yet it can even tell you how long it'll take to sober up and if need be you can even hail a cab with a push of a button so please join me on this mission to help people make smarter and safer decisions one breath at a time thank you so is this already on the market are you selling it currently so we basically launched a march via an indiegogo campaign we sold 4 000 units within 30 days we generate 140 000 in revenue indiegogo is a crowdfunding it's just like kickstarter correct what do you sell them for charles 49.99 can we see it yes i thought one of the biggest issues around these things when the first handheld units came out was that you get arrested or worse you harm somebody because you're drunk and you relied on the device to make your decision isn't that a huge liability to you first and foremost there's no replacement for good judgment and so the prothominar device basically promotes making smarter and safer decisions we provide the instruction manual we clearly label disclaimers throughout the app and as long as we do our part in the due diligence and we uphold our side we're in the clear should i come up and try this with you uh sure feel free to come up and if she doesn't pass if i can't watch if she can walk in those hails you already have your answer so basically go ahead and plug it into the audio jack of your smartphone um all you need to do is hit the start button okay go ahead and breathe into this hole like that [Music] you're at a point zero four right now that would be legal yeah you're legal does it tell you if she has bad breath too uh it's funny as you mentioned that uh there's an al also another sensor we're looking into is for halitosis oh seriously and seriously i'm starting to think of this as more of a multi-function breathalyzer so the next one we're actually trying to focus on is diabetes it's in clinical trials and it's obviously less intrusive than blood pricking right charles how did you develop it are you a software guy you're a hardware design guy so i used to code back in the day i built and sold my last company within 18 months so essentially i went straight into developing breathometer as soon as i exited my last company if you sold your last business and you did very well why don't you take some of that money and invest it in this i have uh so i started off with the first initial 50 000 i've already raised half a million dollars in total from angels what are you going to use the money for uh strictly uh manufacturing of the product well the good news for you is that both in europe and canada mexico us we're going to almost a zero tolerance on alcohol and driving correct that's the trend i'm sure you've heard about the federal safety board in the united states that's true they just lowered it from point zero eight to point zero i'm a big fan of the sensor business i've got a company emotional off we're all about sensors and i think that's the future of technology okay i'm gonna i'm gonna make you an offer all right what i'd like to do is offer you five hundred thousand dollars for 20 of the company that's my offer okay i'll give you a chance to talk to other people sharks mark would you let me go in with you and handle the retailer this is not real i'm not worried about the retail that's just like a smidgen versus the long-term benefit i'll give you 250 000 for 15 you wouldn't have to lose that much equity that's not bad okay it's much less dilutive than mark's 20 percent okay and not nearly as much cash so just to open up the the the funding channel of communication so the whole idea within the next 60 days is to close a full one million dollar round from the angels back in silicon valley so what i'm proposing is i'm more than willing to open up the round to potentially involve more than just one shark because i think there's an incredible amount of value here why don't you let the sharks do the whole round that's what i'm proposing i don't want to work with the other sharks [Music] you want to raise a million dollars don't you i do want to raise a million dollars so mark's not giving you enough anyways mark's not done talking yet all right here's what i'll do charles i'll give you another 250 000 if kevin will have me on that i'll do it that makes a lot of sense to me and i'll give you another 250 000. for 30 wow okay and they have no idea what they're investing in that's not true that is absolutely true so you've got 750 three times what you asked for today right for 30 right very smart i like to surround myself with people much smarter than me that's why i have a challenge being up here thank you very much i want to uh i think i want to match what you're offering 250 000 unlimited manufacturing okay 10 and you wouldn't want to partake in the groups i've tried to get these three bobo's together at breakfast one day and it's hard you know it's like we don't we don't need all these people right now we can't agree we've got three i think we could agree kevin what if we raise the dollar amount wait wait i'm just saying for a million bucks of straight equity and get all the sharks in it now i don't know if mark wants to play ball but we need a significant discount to do that you would be an unbelievable story if that happened that's true mark because of your previous investments in sensors you need the lion's share tell us what that is because competing with each other is going to be very expensive versus colluding with each other and giving this guy every single shark come on mr cuban damn you you're in on this aren't you i'm gonna go in if cuban's in and you'll get all five sharks [Music] charles has the potential of raising one million dollars all the funding he needs at this point if mark will join the rest of the sharks on a deal damn you you're in on this aren't you i'm gonna go in if cuban's in and you'll get all five sharks come on mr cuban you get the lion's share what does the lion's share mean what what equity do i get so we get all five sharks you need a million bucks your turn now it's your turn to sell me oh wow um what can you give us on a straight equity deal this is your round right here right now the whole damn thing wow that's pretty serious uh oh charles think you got to come up with a really good offer okay [Music] would you be okay with taking say 300 doing 300 000 they split up the 700 amongst them i'll do i'll do 500k for 15 for 15 yeah okay all right all five sharks will give you a million dollars 500 000 for mark cuban for 15 and 500 000 split amongst the four of us for the other 15 so 1 million dollars for 30 um do it do it there's a reason the champagne's open my friend can i have a second to make a phone call to my cfo yeah sure of course okay thank you [Music] hey matt how's it going hey charles so they have basically uh all have uh provided an offer um all five of them and so basically a million dollars uh for 30 uh of the company so i just want to kind of get your thoughts you know a million for 30 um 30 you know to 3.3 million dollar valuation not a huge valuation sure i mean i fundamentally i'm a little bit worried about too many cooks in the kitchen i mean they all have big egos and so you know can they work together effectively who wants to bet what he comes back at he'll come back at 25. i say 25. yeah you're right well let's see what happens he's been out there a long time charles welcome back thank you you have an opportunity to get all five sharks and the power of all sharks behind you right here's the deal one million dollars 500 000 from mark cuban for 15 and 500 000 from the rest of the sharks we're gonna split it right for a total of thirty percent for one million dollars and the power of shark tank what are you gonna do i accept all right wow that's great i gotta tell you i didn't see that thank you that's great thank you very much [Music] i've never thought about raising all the cash that we needed from the entire team of the sharks i'm ecstatic right now i have no words i'm shocked you ", "Zuum": "next up is a business capitalizing on the personal electric vehicle trend [Music] okay that's cool hey my name is chico and my name's mason we're both from portland oregon and our company is zoom technologies we're here seeking a 125 000 investment in exchange for 20 of our company the trend towards electric rideables has been taking the us by storm from electric scooters popping up all over cities overnight to everyone and their mother wanting a hoverboard consumers are fascinated with the idea of electric rideables and they're eager to hop onto the trend that's where we got the idea to start our company and introduce zoom shoes to the market zoom shoes are individual self-balancing platforms for your feet that go up to a top speed of eight miles per hour with an average ride time of one hour mason why don't we show the sharks how they work let's do it with zoom shoes there are a ton of different ways you can ride them you can easily maneuver through as well as over different objects but the best part about zoom shoes is you can practice your sick dance moves hit it cheeks [Music] [Laughter] wow just like heaven we're two young entrepreneurs that are dedicated to making electric rideables accessible to the masses so sharks who wants to hop on early and zoom with us towards the future i want to try it remember your children mark you want to try no all right make sure you get on and yeah you basically just lean forward to go forward oh my god wants to go backwards do you feel like you're going to fall off oh come on laurie [Laughter] baby bye robert i locked the door oh he's got it down oh yeah it's got a whole stop wait wait wait could he stop himself or not just like a hoverboard getting on it's not hard it's getting off that's hard exactly it's a little harder to stop nice job that was awesome but what if you're in a city right there's potholes there's like divots in the street sidewalks are always like this so what happens then right so we don't really see it as an alternative to walking in the city the cool thing about the zoom shoes is you can throw them in your backpack what is the price 2.99 2.99 what do they cost landed 130. so who created this so the manufacturer designs it and we introduced it into the us and we met with a manufacturer over in china we flew over to them okay so you're a distributor you've already made products what stops me mr wonderful from going to the same manufacturer and bringing this zoom out as the wonderboard what stops you from doing that nothing but what we have nothing we have our company we have zoom and we in january of this year we launched a kickstarter campaign for these and we raised 25 000 just to get manufacturing done well we raised the money to test the market because we really see kickstarter as a good way to see is there a proof of concept mason do you have exclusive rights on the contract tell me the deal that you made to bring the product we don't have exclusive rights on the technology what relax kevin this self-balancing technology is available i get for sale but what do you have that's the reason why we're here we want to take that money um that we're asking for to create custom design that's a bad idea guys look one of the key things for any entrepreneur is to know what business you're in if you were to come in and said here's who we are we realize other people can come in and sell the same product but here's why we are the best sales organization you guys didn't come in and say that though you didn't tell us that's where your expertise was and for those reasons i'm out what's your biggest obstacle um i think it would just be i don't know what do you think chica the capital intensive and having the connect connection of like a shark you're not persuasive at all if you were to ask me what the obstacle was with every single business i've invested in this moment i can tell you exactly what they're confronting and they know it okay so our biggest obstacle with this is capital we just we have opportunities we just can't fulfill those opportunities because we don't have the money for inventory since it is here i have to stop you there i've never seen a business a young entrepreneur inexperienced entrepreneur whose problem was solved by money period the thing that solves every problem is passion and i've seen people make huge successes without a dime in their pocket if they have the passion and we will we will if we don't have the capital we'll just grow slower i have a question what's your competition does segway have one yes they came out with a pair as well they're more expensive and they have that brand recognition that's why they sell for hire that's everything that brand name is really hard to go up against when you're small so my confusion here is i understand you're repping products that's fine i'm not sure why you picked this that can have so much trouble down your road i feel because you have all those issues it's not a wise investment for me today so i'm sorry i'm out guys let's take stock where we're at you do not own anything in a very competitive market i don't want to discourage you or maybe i do i actually think this sucks um i hate it i'm out thank you thanks kevin i i'm just trying to go back what the game plan is because i'm a little unclear you don't make the product you have no exclusivity there's nothing proprietary about your product what's the vision for the vision we know some manufacturers in china that we want to innovate on top of the current electric scooter market but we want to create more of a catalog of electric rideable markets robert what are you going to do i'll do this for you i'm now robert i'm out see you later look i i wish you all the best but i don't trust you with my money i just don't trust you're gonna be a custodian of my money and make more of it with this business i'm out okay guys listen hire a great salesperson no go out and sell yourselves it's your product figure it out outsource sales when you're starting glory let them go and steep in their misery good luck guys thank you [Music] wish we could have came out there with more energy we're gonna take what they said and you know really try to sell our product and really market it and just continue what we're doing because we're on the right path you ", "Critter Pricker": "next into the tank is a way to keep unwanted visitors away from your property [Music] hi sharks my name is joe balasteri i'm from chihola pennsylvania and i'm here seeking a hundred and fifteen thousand dollars for fifteen percent equity in my company sharks property owners can never feel too secure you never know who's gonna hop your fence break on your property in the middle of night and rummage through your things these bandits cause thousands of dollars in damages a day you know who i'm talking about raccoons looking in the pest control industry for last 15 years i've seen it all these little bandits dig through our trash cans break into our addicts to breed and defecate in our pools getting rid of raccoons can be costly and of course there's no guarantee more won't move in to take their place so that's why i invented the critter pricker the most humane way to protect your property against raccoons and other pesky wildlife being that raccoons have hyper sensitive hands and a lack of depth perception once they come in contact with the critter prickers patented plastic strips they quickly move on goodbye trash panda hello peace of mind plastic strips snap together very easily either end to end or side to side to customize those locations you want to protect also our live hinges allow you to bend and shape the product around square and circuit locations such as bird feeders and fences the critter pricker won't just keep your property free of raccoons but of unwanted cats and even humans so who wants to get their paws on the critter parker and see how it works i got some samples for you absolutely oh my gosh so funny that's great it's a serious problem here you go thank you well this thing's a heavy thank you like thank you oh wow these are really serious prickers oh my god that's for real i'm just gonna say these are extremely pointy all up and down and if you just touch it it's serious it hurts yeah so let's say a raccoon steps on this i mean this is sharp it doesn't make them bleed so what happens with raccoons they have hyper sensitive hands okay they can see far but not up close so they taste they feel their hands and when they come into those areas like a pool they'll have to touch it it becomes so uncomfortable they're not keep walking past because they're only doing this why don't you break down the numbers from me i'm selling for 27.99 at 32.99 online it cost me eight dollars to make so far this year i made 80 000 so you've made 80 000 in sales that's it this year now i ran out six weeks ago because i went to a trade show in orlando and had over 800 different pool technicians say they love it so what they do they bought it they bought me out within two weeks after that trade show pretend you're surrounding this rug you're standing on with your product how much would that cost me to surround the edge i'm gonna give you a better explanation on how as long as you give me the answer i'm okay with that so what happens is raccoon's like only to defecate on the front step of the pool it mimics them walking into a shoreline it's latrine they like to hide their droppings they don't like to do their droppings where they live so you just have to cover the step front step only you're only putting around the front step but then what happens when the kids want to go down the steps the next morning so what happens is the product can be moved uh it's heavy it won't blow away but what happens set it up every night allowed my customers just leave it but it has to be put somewhere where somebody isn't going to step on it right how do you get this on top of your don't put it on you put it around the garbage can bend it's like a straight i'm missing something can you show us one piece this is a uh three connected strips you would put it you would build them out to here oh how wide does it have to be i i built it to be 18 inches now when i filmed it that will stop the like a big mama raccoon because if you see this one's about 24 inches standing on pull her out of the garbage let's have a look at it i don't think raccoons really jump that's a big one right but don't they kind of crawl and walk slowly i mean i i have never seen a raccoon that would jump eighteen eighteen inches or nothing show raccoons i mean i still there's okay when i was filming i was studying the product now if you look online you're gonna see all these gimmicky products say oh it works i want it to be different i want to show you the results joe you know what joe i can tell you a couple things one it's obvious you know your stuff right and not only is it obvious you're confident about you're even a little bit arrogant because you know and that's not a bad education yeah because you know right and you're confident in your knowledge but the thing about it is i would be terrified that somebody would set me up and let you know a neighbor walk on it cut their foot or whatever but were you installing it i mean really the only way you're stepping on it is if it's around the pool yeah but you're dependent on your customer being smart right and they're not going to sue you they're going to assume me right that's the problem for me so for those reasons i'm out thank you for your time you know i think it's a clever solution outside the box thinking my concern is a liability issue i could picture my very nice neighbor hopping across my fence and ripping his feet out so i think that really scares me can i ask you what could scare you tomorrow yeah raccoon round worm is a lot of the droppings but when it's defecated in the pool and it spreads because the filter turns on it literally just spread it so you're not using your pool i just don't see this working i'm out thank you the investor has to relate to the problem i've never really had this problem but another thing is you know my dogs will be running around the yard i'm gonna forget that this is out and it's gonna cause a lot more damage there plus i think that raccoons are very smart i'm gonna have drinks with a raccoon later on tonight i need some advices and stuff so the liability of course though for the animals and for the kids it's a little dangerous for me so i'm out thank you i know huge problem i know that it's a solution that doesn't have poisons or killing the animal which i like but everybody here's saying that they're worried about either their own pets or a neighbor or a family member stepping on it maybe there's something halfway in between you're paying me to get rid of your problem i don't want to waste time come to your house 15 times getting rid of something that should be done the first time i guess i'm just not bought in 100 but i think you're on to a good idea i'm sorry i'm out thank you [Music] are you interested cap do you have anything else in your portfolio i don't have a critter pricker in my portfolio and that fits you so well okay i'll make you an offer i know the product has merit okay i'm just trying to figure out how to structure a deal to make sense because you're telling me i got to pay over 700 000 valuation on something with 80 in sales i'll give you 115 000 for the 15 so i'm not taking any more equity but i want to get a royalty of 2.50 cents a unit [Music] how long ago it's perpetual it's a professional royalty that keeps me incentivized to grow the business [Music] you got a deal thank you joe congrats joe let's go make some money money congrats joe thank you great thank you guys for your time well done joe well done i've worked so hard to get to this point and let it all go and it feels good and i thank every doubter who gave up on me and i proved them wrong i did it you ", "LUCIDArt": "[Music] first in the tank is a new take on an old

basically you see it reflected you see like your ghost handle i see so it doesn't do the drawing for you it still requires practice and patience but it helps you get results quickly and actually helps you learn over time interesting who knew and you're saying this has been around for centuries the historical tool that it's based on is the camera lucida which was first patented in like 1807. i mean it's been centuries that that artists have used these sorts of devices um to help i can't see what he's doing i'm just tracing around the shark observe lori how easy that was isn't that amazing thank you thank you that is absolutely spectacular what do you attach it to like what are the steps yes so you clamp to the table you set whatever is in front of you then you look through it and you see basically looks like a three-dimensional hologram of whatever's in front of you then you can draw over that and it's not as simple as just tracing paper it actually involves a little more skill it revolves more practice well obviously obviously the first time you do it you you work with it for 30 minutes you're gonna be drawing things like you've never imagined you can draw do you have a patent i have a i have a provisional patents on this but you said it's been around for a long time yeah i'm sorry on the improvements and so the the the historical device it had a lot of issues it's a reason people stopped using it the image was small it was unsteady and i spent four years tinkering with my garage making it working and making it new again so it's something that artists want to use this is for either artists who already are you know serious about it or someone who really wants to take it seriously so 20 of our cells are the people learning to draw 20 are professional artists who they can actually draw just as good without it but it speeds up their process and in the middle there that at 60 in the middle are people who are amateur artists who just want to learn how to draw better so you were here before with that device you took it out behind the barn and shot it yes why did you get into this yeah what has happened since then i've been an artist and inventor since i was a little kid always drawing designs in my early 20s i was going to school and my my teacher had brought in the historical device into class and i was so mesmerized but something so simple could create that image and he started talking about the problems with it that it doesn't work very well so i spent four years tinkering in my garage to make a design that was something that was way better than one has ever been before then i went from the inventor in my garage to the entrepreneur trying to sell this thing and i hit a roadblock in like 2010 and so i got sidetracked with a few things including a a bib that you barf in that actually ended up on shark tank less yes what do you sell it for what's it cost you to make what are your sales in the last 12 months okay so the lucy flex that's going to cost him about 128 it cost us 25 and 50 cents to make it past 12 months did 2.3 million wow wow what i told you millions right at the beginning did you think lying come on no old friend that's impressive did you make any money on that last year we did 3.7 total and we made 1.6 million profits wow incredible what has been your lifetime sales 10 million what 10 million million dollars so let's break down who you're selling to yeah so you're selling direct to consumer 95 is direct 95 from from direct consumer from our website and how are you getting people are you doing facebook ads instagram ads what works best for you less well youtube is really good because people who are going on youtube and they're going to watch a drawing tutorial right so they're they're typing in how to learn to draw how much are you spending on advertising last year was a big year we did we did about 70 000 a month in advertising wow from watching shark tank every time i saw an entrepreneur coming in with these awesome numbers they said social media was what was driving it and so i sat down and actually spent hours watching videos learned how to do it so then the advertising started taking off in 2018 when i did that a million uh 2019 1.9 then of course uh 3.7 in 2020. but les why do you need the money you made 1.6 million i'm here for a shark our biggest pain point right now that i think a shark can help us with is cost per acquisition look it's a challenge because the customer acquisition you have to find a subset of people that would use a tool that want to draw right so whatever your customer acquisition costs are now and what are they it's uh about 48 on average for the year okay and your margin when you sell one unit is what cost is 25 we're selling for 130. so you're basically you're over a hundred dollars worth of profit so you're giving up half your profit to acquire the customer so now i understand your problem you want to get that every dollar you can reduce your customer acquisition goes straight to your pocket so this is really about driving sales through customer acquisition that's it so let me step in congratulations on what you've been able to accomplish but this is not a product that gets me excited at all so for those reasons come out okay i'm sorry to hear that but i got into a little bit about what i want a partnership with the shark about you know cost per acquisition and those those sorts of things one thing too is we don't have recurring income and this would be a perfect product to marry with online courses to be able to teach people how to draw with it i'm in awe of your journey no kid one day you're the barf bad guy and then you sell 10 million of something and guess what you are a success everybody in this country gets a second chance you've done an amazing job but it's just not a product i'm passionate about sincerely congratulations very proud of you i'm adam thank you thank you i appreciate that you know it's a very cool device what i find most amazing is that you are making boatloads of money yeah and you came in asking you know very fair ask of a shark i think you're doing phenomenally by yourself and i feel like it's the right product for you not for me but i wish you good luck i'm up thank you very much for your kind words i just can't believe how advanced i've become for me it's just not something i want to go down the pike on because it's too nichey a market for me i like to do scale like big i'm just i gotta tell you i didn't even believe you and you know you are the barf bag guy that's our memory no he's not he's the 10 million dollar man now yeah i listen i'm very impressed but it's just not for me thank you unless i'm out i think everybody's out except for me i'm absolutely blown away with these numbers man um why do you believe that we can change your customer acquisition costs are lower because anybody in the world who walk up to you and tell you and look at your business from an acquisition cost and say i can do better than that a hundred percent when you have done so well they're lying to you i'm not under the delusion that somehow bringing in a shark is gonna be able to run my business magically better than i can okay i just know that you will bring more value than equity that i give you in terms of not just the acquisition but also the courses well you don't know that to hear his offer i know the courses yeah for sure listen um i've never done that before i don't have expertise in that area yeah and that's a we have 70 000 emails 7 000 customers of people who have bought that before that we don't have anything to sell them oh and that's 70 000 emails yeah well that's like talking dirty we can very here's what i want to do um i'll offer you the three hundred thousand for twenty percent so i mean i think i came in with a pretty reasonable evaluation value at uh three million which is five times you absolutely did but you were in the tank baby i understand sometimes people come in here and they they evaluate it based on cells they're projecting with both math into the future and i came with real hard sales yeah 100 would you for 12 let me paint the picture for you 17.5 okay so the highest i can go is 15. that's exactly where i wanted to land gotcha thank you appreciate it give it to me come on baby there you go huh all right all right guess that now i love you man thank you thank you great job congratulations last time i left the tank i was determined not to give up so if you have an idea that doesn't work out take it behind the barn and shoot it because you are more than the ideas you have you can you can create something bigger something better and start over and that's what america is about and that's what this pitch was about and making a deal with damon um is just is just amazing you ", "Beulr": "next up is what the entrepreneur believes is the best way to maximize your time i don't see anything um hello is it just my angle well this is riveting i got it from here thank you hi sharks uh my name's peter i'm a software engineer from york maine and i'm here today seeking 150 000 in exchange for 20 of my company bueller but what is bueller well it's the first and only product of its type and essentially what we do is allow our users to be in two places at once or more anytime you have conflicting obligations me for example i like to sleep in but i did have to be here today well i can use bueller bueller is the application that attends online meetings for you that's right it's the first and only product of its type to date we've helped tens of thousands of people around the globe avoid those tedious online meetings where you kind of have to go but at the same time you really don't need to it is very simple to use let me show you how it works once you've created an account on bueller click schedule a bot and then enter the meeting nickname give it an id and a password copy and paste the meeting link enter the days of the week you'd like bueller to arrive what time to arrive and how long to stay for from there you can just upload a video of yourself pretending to pay attention sipping your tea you know having a good time and then you're all set once you complete you don't need to leave your computer open you don't need to leave your laptop running or anything like that all your online meetings are attended through the cloud so sharks who's ready to join me in helping the world to log off sleep in and be in two places at once i i thought that's what it was until you actually said it and this is from ferris bueller right bueller bueller that's great i wish this was out when i was dating so i'm sleeping but my what do you call me virtually and now you're personal my persona is attending a meeting right and mark asks me a question right i mean i ignore him the first time mark thinks it's normal he asked me again i still ignore him how does mark not figure out it's not really me right okay so there's there's two things there that i'll say the first is right now this is an mvp right like all it is is minimal viable it's a functioning minimum viable product with tens of thousands of users but um to address the question uh i'm sorry could you repeat it one more time it was someone asks you a question he's so used to not showing up he doesn't even know the questions are you in another place right now you would be surprised so okay so if someone asks you a question right now it's a static video it doesn't handle for any sort of interaction so all i'm getting today is a static video static static video that's it that's it by the way i have to commit i have to commit the hour of just sitting sipping tea and stuff to make that static no it loops a video you can use people yeah but after after two or three meetings in your company they're gonna like but it's not for companies why is it all doing the same thing how did you get into this how did you come up with this idea yeah so when i was 12 i took a computer science class absolutely fell in love with it i've been building products and and whatnot ever since and then i went to tulane i was on the path i was interning at goldman sachs i was on track to graduate summa laude and then the pandemic it was march 16th of 2020. classes went online and i had this 8 am that i was so tired of waking up for and i was thinking i'm never ever talking in this class i'm never being asked questions why don't i just send something to attend for me i'll go watch the recording on 2xp later and i'm actually giving myself more productivity so instead of it thank you thank you so instead of being in this room sitting to this miserable meeting waiting for this lecture to end i can like be in two places at once go out for a walk in the sun when i wake up and then come back and watch my lectures later productive peter how many people have used the product 92 000 at the last time i checked yeah and i've spent i spent a total of three hundred dollars on marketing it's just viral word of mouth growth do you charge for it at all so right now the way i think about it is sales should not be the goal growth should be the goal this is an internet scalable venture-backable moonshot idea but we do have sales um the only reason we have sales is because after dropping out of school i completely ran out of money when i was building it uh maxed out all my credit cards had a movement with my mom maybe you should have attended more of the classes yeah right it's a good backup so how did you get sales um so then when that happened i started charging new users around 699 a month we make right now about a thousand dollars a month why not just charge a one-time fee of like five bucks that's a good point i do like that idea though i think that's um you didn't it didn't cross your mind at all you dropped out of school dropped out of school why while i was working on a part-time while i was in school i was learning ten times more by building a product and actually being a business person the question is what skill set do you have that allows you to take this vision further dpt3 if you're talking about using ai what do you know about those areas i mean i'm not an ai expert by any stretch of the imagination but i have a as a computer science major a pretty decent understanding of how to connect these systems you must have tried to raise money a gold medal did you take it to any other we haven't taken any investment any outside investment have you pitched this to any other i have pitched it to like two it was it was very kind of informal conversations with vcs that just like getting feedback on the idea and seeing where it goes so i could see it being useful for some people students like you etc but the integrity issue bothers me and i do think it could get people in trouble as equally as it could help them it's not a business for me sure so i'm sorry i'm out i really appreciate your time though thank you uh peter i i just love it as an idea but you know to laura's issues there may be some compliance issues that may be brought forward because attendance is sometimes legally required in some of the worlds i live in and so that's my concern but i wish you the best uh i can't be an investor i'm out i appreciate it thank you i i think it's a hilarious pitch you created the new form of hooky um has the potential to be a lot more too but you know maybe i'm oversensitive to it i think communication is the only thing that separates us from the animals and to to feel like somebody opted out of communicating i don't feel comfortable with it i'm out thank you i would love to just address kind of the the idea as a business um doesn't exist there's there's no business here this is not a business you will not run this as a business you can't make revenue off this business it's a bad idea i'm out i appreciate it the app is great but there's not a direct path to monetization the the next iteration of the product would be a simple drag and drop flow of a decision builder where you still have pre-recorded videos but now if you put basic language processing on top of that or voice recognition do you realize how expensive that is though i just don't see the path peter i would go back to school because if you really want to win in this space you got to know your ai better than everybody else that's fair right it's because you can't just depend on hiring a team because it's expensive right and it's changing every single day otherwise someone's just going to jump in hey mark sam i'm out all right well all right thank you guys so much thank you so much take care when i learned today if mark cuban wants me to finish college and maybe i should i was thinking i'm probably fine but uh we'll see i might go back to school mark i just want you to know something during the back end of that when you're grilling him i actually wasn't here i just came back you ", "Bad Birdie": "[Applause] next up is a modern version of a [Music] classic what's up sharks my name is jason richardson and i'm from los angeles california today i'm looking for 300 000 in exchange for 10 equity in my company bad birdie now before we talk about the birdie unfortunately we have to talk about the bad you walk into any golf store pro shop search any online retailer and you're gonna see these basic options for golf polos solid colors or if you're feeling a little bit more edgy you can go with the stripes guys get out of here wow bye as you can see most options are safe they're unoriginal and they're based on the outdated overly proper boring golf culture of the past so meet bad birdie bad birdie makes performance golf pulls with the freshest the most fun styles that make you stand out on the course they're moisture wicking anti-odor anti-microbial and they offer sun protection they fit amazing and they just look sick baby people are loving it and we cannot keep up with the demand so sharks who's looking to pour a little bit of fuel on this fire and blow this thing up let's go baby sharks there's some pulls for issue guys all right oh i love this there we go i love this one bestsellers jason i got a question for you yeah why would anybody play golf [Music] i mean i hate golf i've heard that from so many people golf has a history of being boring it's dull it's overly proper but golf is becoming more popular for the younger generation but you don't need to golf to wear this no you don't but that's my point right i don't want because this is a performance so these are made performance for on the course to have all the technical features of any other golf polo but they're cool looking shirts thanks yeah i love golf it's wonderful i'm good for the first two hours after that i'm like i can't believe i'm out here for five hours yeah there is a lot of stuff like this in the market there's several companies in golf that have targeted the older golfer those that are say 40 and up tell us what your plan is to gain market share what's the plan to give you guys some context i started this company two and a half years ago i walked into a golf store and i was trying to find something cool and i was like there's got to be someone out there that wants to buy a shirt like this i have no background in apparel no idea how to make a golf post so i just started googling how do i make a golf polo so i just started making as many calls as i can hustling figuring it out spent 20 000 of my own dollars in the first year i did seventy two thousand dollars the second year i sold four hundred and twelve thousand dollars four hundred and twelve thousand thousand dollars this year today i'm at seven hundred and sixty thousand i should close the year at one point two wow hustler i yes so my sales go like this all online it's all online until this last year but just so you have context of sales when i release these polos i have loyal customers that buy within the first hour they come out and my problem has been i continually sell out and i'm reinvesting cash flow into it to be able to buy inventory and i keep hitting them they wait for your drop date right yeah so it depends on the shirts generally i do drops every two months if it's a super hot seller like example this one right here is called wildlife that was just launched a month ago and it sold so well within the first hour that it's going to move into our best sellers my favorite how many new designs a year are you going to drop per season i do about 30 designs and then on top of that i do a limited edition run who does the design i started doing them all myself with graphic designers now i've basically built a team of probably 10 or so designers that i work with what does it cost to manufacture and what do you sell it for so i sell these polos for 72 dollars i started making them for 40 now i make them for 25 and my next run coming from overseas is coming in for 17 and within the next six months i should be able to get that down to where do you make them now here so right now i've made them all in la last year i started selling wholesale um so far they served at about 150 000 of wholesale by the end of this month i'll have 300 000 committed for next year why do you feel that you need to expand in retail if you're doing so well online yeah i think i want to do that because it's an opportunity and it helps grow the brand and this shirt is going to have a run of how many for next year i'll probably be doing like a thousand to 2 000 per shirt okay the reason i asked that as opposed to going to retail right every kid right now every millennial gen z right you're trained by by shoes right that the drop date is the date jordan 34 when's it going to hit right everybody's waiting in line when you told me you were doing that i'm like that's brilliant yeah because that's what connects you yeah to golfers that are 30 and under now the minute you've got those same lines in a retail store yeah there's nobody waiting in line they're not going to sell out do you see the difference there i 100 see the difference what you've got right now is this incredible momentum online at full margin cash flow you're killing in these drops and we see you've got to believe us we've seen so many apparel deals where the guys get buried been there done that it sucks this conversation has gone a lot about retail i'm only projecting to keep retail like 25 or less that's that's not the point it's not the percentage right it's the relationship with the buyer if you've already paid 72 you can pay 99. yeah right if you can pay 99 you can pay 129. when those drops are limited yeah so i just want to jump in here for a minute yeah your shirts you walked in here and you said the reason why you did all of this this is your niche market is because everything's boring out there right so if that's true if your competition is boring anywhere you then put your shirts amidst the sea of dull you're going to pop and stand out that's really good people are going to gravitate to it so you can do it all so to speak anyway i think that some of my fellow sharks are more interested in investing in a golf shirt than i am but i just don't find that it's the right investment for me so i'm sorry i'm out thanks laura i appreciate that i was looking at this saying there is no way in hell i'd put 300 000 into apparel where there's so much competition but sales don't lie here's my offer i'll give you 300 000 i forbid you to go to retail i don't care what laurie says 300 000 for 30 but zero retail zero retail you don't take that offer you have to beg to get that shirt on the drop date beg like a dog for it okay so i don't see it like that i think when you're when you're hot you gotta stay hot i don't know how this all became completely about retail no no it's just to me it's like you said i'm riding the wave and you know what when when the wave crashed you can always pull back we have a great investment in a company called butter cloth we're all online about three and a half million but i like this because it's all about targeting your customer that's great i'll give you the 300 000 for 25 and you're a smart guy i won't forbid you to sell more anywhere you'll figure it out and i think we can really help you okay as much as i like the concept retail always scares me totally i would tell you jack up your prices bro if you're selling out yeah you're selling too cheap yeah i'm excited for you it's just not a fit for me right now so for those reasons i'm out appreciate it mark let me say something retail is about real estate they start charging you for hanging fees you have to sell it at half the price that you sold online right they pay you in 30 60 maybe 90 days they return good they don't like it is horrible i don't want to put that pressure on you i'm out so you have two offers jason what do you want to do [Music] three sharks are out jason is seeking 300 000 for a 10 stake in his modern golf shirt business bad birdie kevin has offered three hundred thousand dollars for thirty percent and robert has

oh there he goes [Music] [Laughter] okay so go ahead guys we'll play for a second how did you guys come up with this idea I was at a celebration and we're spraying some champagne and it was over too fast friends of mine and I were like something needs to be done here we need to have some more fun so I love building things I got a mechanical engineering background and as well as some other things but I I took it upon myself I was like I'm gonna go home and I weld it up this little item and I was like this this could be fun I just did it for fun at the time I never thought it would turn into a business and one night I was out with I got a bunch of buddies over at SpaceX and I showed them all this like dude we need to have this at all of our events we love this thing but we want you to make like a more professional version so I designed uh what you see in front of you and with the help of the SpaceX dudes we made some 3D printed ones and at that stage I was pretty much done with the project but everyone that I talked to they're like we all want this thing how do we buy one and then I met Brad who just got his MBA at the time we teamed up and uh they're being manufactured now just outside Hong Kong so what does one cost and what does it cost you to make sale price is 99.99 with a landed cost of 18.50 what it's 1850 land and you settle for 100 bucks yeah wow and how many of you sold since our launch last year we've sold 560 000 wow we sell break it from our website on Amazon all right guys guys look oh you're selling is fun you just know real utility oh you know what I would buy in this 500 bottle of champagne and I wanted to drink it out of a gun though but Mark every Championship has to have that oh yeah hell yeah I wish we had that in 09 when we won the championship yeah so I love it how much first of all how much do you own of the business how much money have you raised we're 50 50 Partners we're both we're total total contribution is 120 000. 16. we've been bootstrapping since day one so no debt no debt so tell me what would you use the money for you want to put that money to elevating enhancing our ad spin you know kind of let it you know put the fuel in the fire and additional inventory because we rented that situation our launch here where it sold out way too quickly so what's your vision for this there's a whole channel of the business to business so we had a lot of interest from you know bars hotels restaurants the pool parties things like that but why would you just stay direct to Consumers covid kind of heard because people couldn't go out and party as much right yeah so even like event companies and hotels right Caterers just buy from you because it's 99 bucks right I have a little bit yeah you don't need to have a wholesaler you don't need to go to a retailer the bigger question is can you get your price down even lower than 1850. volume for sure what do you volumes need to be I mean we do we usually do a 5 000 unit increments now but if they go down if you go to 25 000. I mean 25 000 probably closer to 10. I got to tell you guys something you came in here with 120 000 for 20 and puts a 600 000 valuation that's not crazy you might get a deal you might get a deal we'll get a deal I'll offer you the 120 for 25 percent just got to tell me and if not I'll go out that's a no-brainer done yeah I'd love to get you guys together yes you guys did that with ice sugar I think it is then you got to give us 30 percent oh could you do uh 180 for 30 percent [Music] yeah we can do that yeah let's do that done yeah congratulations guys ", "Switch Witch": "Next up is a product that the entrepreneurs hope will become a popular Halloween tradition.

Okay, we're going to read the switch witch story. The sun goes down. It's time for bed. Go brush your teeth, you sleepy head. Leave your sweets with your switch witch friend. When kind of candy in the bucket switch is coming tonight. Switch witch is coming. Dump it all in. All right. [Music] Okay. Lie down for bed, guys. It's the way the switch witch comes. Go ahead. Lie right down. While you're asleep, these words will ring. You might might hear your switch witch sing. Switch aazam. Switch a zing. Switch these treats for a special thing. When morning comes up with the sun, guys, wake up. Look. Look. Your gift is set in candy. Something you'll love. It's sure to be three. Cheers for super switch fun. Okay, guys. Thanks so much. Good job. Great costume. High five. The shark. Down goes the shark. Bye. Good job, kids. Good job. Bye, Sharks. We know our product is fun for kids and a problem solver for parents, but we need your help in this magical journey to take Switch Witch to every household across America every Halloween. So, let me get this right. You basically take the kids candy and when they wake up, their candy's gone. You're not worried about litigation? Not when they see the gift they've received from their SW. So, so the way the um whole idea came up is my kids came home Halloween night 2013 and my wife yells to me, 'Rob, Rob, do we have anything to give the kids?' And I'm like, 'What are you talking about?' She goes, 'Switch is coming.' I said, 'Who is the Switch Witch?' My kids threw every ounce of candy they had right up on the countertop and we obviously didn't have anything for them. I actually threw them five bucks each. We took the candy away. I said, 'Wow, what a brilliant idea.' So, Rob, let me understand the concept. Yes. I'm a child. I go out tricking. Thank you. I come home with my candy, I dump it after all that candy I look forward to all year and you give me this in exchange. Actually, the switch witch leaves and we don't encourage kids to leave all of their candy. Oh, they only give up some of that. They pick their favorite. So you but you give them just this or you give them a gift. Something like this basically has to be viral on its own. It can't be forced. So I'm trying to I haven't heard of it. My kids haven't heard of it. Never heard of it. Yeah. So, that makes me concerned that it's not viral and it's being forced. What's amazing to me is and when Yahoo did a thing on us on October 30th, our sales jumped like crazy. Unfortunately, it was October 30th. Um, it ended up our Facebook ended up going viral. The seasonality of this idea is brutal. And the next day after Halloween, no one cares. That's kind of like saying no one cares about Christmas because you have one day and then it's over. You don't want to switch. You said the concepts been around for a while, correct? So that's why So this is public domain. It is. So tell us by unit, what it sells for, what it costs you, and then in aggregate what your sales are. Um, we ran into some trouble um manufacturing. Uh, we we did it all in the United States. Um, so we started at $29.95. It's a plush toy for $29. A little st with a book in the packaging. And we priced it at Elf on the Shelf. Mention the bench. Mench on a bench, Lori. But where were you selling them and how many did you really sell? We sold 815 units in our first season. 52% was online, Amazon, and our own website. We did 24% grassroots. I was out knocking on doors. I was in sale in Massachusetts. We were at craft fairs. People loved this product. So, your sales 24,000. Our sales were 15,700. Parents are having a hard time with it. Why didn't it take off? We feel it did. I mean, it was our first season. Um, we did those sales. We did those sales in one month from grassroots. And look, the merit of reducing sugar is right on trend. However, for an investor, this is a nonproprietary plush doll with no brand, right? I've never heard of it. I think you should take the cue from what actually happened in Salem. In the old days, they used to burn the witches. If I were you, I'd take this behind the barn and burn it cuz I think it sucks. I'm out. Especially with the media that you had, guys. I mean, nobody ever walks onto the carpet and says, 'People don't like our product.' Right? Of course, we expect you to say and and think that people loved it, but it didn't sell. It's not like you ran out of product. The big media push was the day before Halloween. Um and and mostly the only venue for people to get the product was online. People were paying overnight shipping so after they saw the Yahoo article so that they could get it in time for Halloween. I think I think, you know, for me, I love Halloween. I love it of getting free candy. So, I I can't get behind it. I I don't see it. I'm out. Okay. Thank you, Robert. We're really trying to build a a whole family tradition around it. We did a deal with Mench on a Bench, and there's so many days of Hanukkah. Same as with the elf, it's on the shelves for so many days. But here, it's like a one night, one-time thing. Whereas both of those models, it's many days and and a leadup. This is too. I'm out. Thank you, Lori. Can I translate what she just said? What she said is your idea sucks. Well, guys, Halloween is a 7.4 billion dollar industry. Cardinal rule. You just broke the cardinal rule. When someone comes in and tells us it's just an enormous multi-billion dollar industry, suggesting that, oh, if we just get a tiny amount, we'll be okay. And you know what? I'm not buying it. I think you're introducing more stress than you're solving. I mean, because as a parent, and I have three young kids, too, right? They're young enough, we're still taking them around. When they come back, we're grabbing the bag, throwing half of them away, letting them pick their best and getting it done. I just think, you know, it's hard to push something forward and make it viral. It kind of has to be organically viral. So, for those reasons, I'm out. Thank you, Mark. And then there was one. First of all, this could be a hobby, which could be great. It can grow into some something big. FUB was a hobby for me at first. I think it's a great hobby that may grow into something amazing. It just may be too soon for me. So, I'm out. Okay. Thank you. Thank you very much. Good luck, guys. Good luck. When we came here, we thought for sure we'd get a deal. There's no question that the Sharks missed out on a great opportunity. We are going to be the next mention of the bench and out for the show.", "ChompShop": "First into the tank is a tool that brings kids imaginations to the next level. Hey Sharks, I'm Ky and I'm Max. We're from Philadelphia and we're looking for $250,000 for 5% of our company. Now, sharks, we all know that a child's creativity knows no bounds. I mean, look, I'm a cardboard knight. Luckily, I'm a cardboard astronaut with a jetpack. And that stack of sturdy cardboard boxes from all the stuff that we've bought online is perfect to be upcycled for kids art projects. But when it comes to working with cardboard, the tools for kids, just don't cut it. Scissors. We love you, but stick to paper. Uh, box cutter. Not till you're older. Much much older. That's why we created the Chompsaw, the kids safe power tool for cutting cardboard and building 3D models with ease. Because what kid wouldn't want to use a power tool like this to make awesome stuff like this? Now, the chompsaw works like a really fast hole punch, which intercepts cardboard and chomps it off bit by bit. So, Sharks, who's ready to help inventors of all ages unleash their creative potential and cut a deal with the chomp saw? That's pretty cool. I love it. Yeah. So, each of you sharks, you have a sample in front of you of our chomp saw. And we'd love for each of you to try cutting out. So, when a kid inevitably touches it, what happens? Let me show you. If I try shoving my finger, even if you take the cardboard out, nothing. Yeah. Nothing. Cool. So, my suggestion while you're cutting, try and follow the black lines. You look like you know what you're doing. I do not. Now, what's happening here? Now, why isn't it going curving when I turn it? Just like a band saw, if you push like this, you have to twist the cardboard. And now you can get nice curves, like that. Okay. Okay. Hey, did you say this was for 44 year olds? Yes. It's for kids of all ages. Kids of all ages. Voila. Oh, yeah. Beautiful rock. The kids love it a lot, but every time a parent gets their hands on it, they can't get enough. Yeah. Fun to do, though. Let's go. All right. Yeah. All right. Yeah. Wow. What's super great is you're taking the cardboard box. Yes. And then creating everything, you know, anything from a sword to a fish to a castle to whatever. So do you send instructions on these different projects? Absolutely. So it comes with just a simple user manual which explains you how to get started but our website is chock full of special instructions. We are also in the process of developing a monthly subscription for cardboard projects. Every month kids will just receive any little materials that they need to complete the project and they'll follow different themes that teach different STEM concepts. I love how you're staying in character too. It's fun to hold. What is the age group that this is intended to? Our target market is eight plus, and that's mainly due to the compliance requirements for products for kids younger than eight. I'm not going to say you can't operate it, but we highly would recommend parental supervision while you do that. I do have a son who is three. He's our number one marketing star. Uh he has blown us up on social media, videos of him operating this tool himself. You know what I love about this? Everything today is about tablets and computers and phones and this takes you back to the basics of being able to work with your hands and be creative. And people are going back to that. Like the youth want tactile things and experiences and you have the supply because of the boxes. Exactly. Yeah. So 250,000 5% of a $5 million valuation now that we understand exactly what the product does. And by the way, I would say I made the best shark. So beautiful. That's a really good exercise. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you everybody. But let's talk about sales because you better have some. Yeah. Um, so we launched less than a year ago for pre-orders only. We haven't delivered our product yet. And in the less than a year since we've launched, we've sold $2.1 million. Is that a Kickstarter or? We uh originally launched on Kickstarter. We raised uh close to $1.2 $2 million last October and since then we've raised an additional almost a million dollars. And you haven't delivered a unit yet, right? We haven't delivered any units yet. How many do you owe? We uh sold close to 10,000 units so far. And what price have you put on them? Uh they cost $230. Wow, it's expensive. And how close are you to delivering? Yeah, we'll be shipping them out in about a month. I'm actually returning our factories in China. I will be back there next weekend to oversee the last production test run of a thousand units. So your whole company ride is on the line when you go back to China pretty much. What do they cost you to make? It it costs us 73.81 to make. So you're only going to be selling these direct to consumer. Right now we only sell direct to consumer. But once we have inventory, we really want to start to explore. March is not enough to put retail in the middle of this. Kelsey, how did you come up with the idea? Yeah. So, I came up with the idea, Max and I actually both met doing our master's program of product design at the University of Pennsylvania. Um, and so I came up with the idea during a class for that program and the goal was teaching kids design thinking skills and we use cardboard so often. We got to the prototyping stage. I realized that working with cardboard is really difficult for kids as much as they love it. And have you guys raised money before? We've raised a a total of $5,000 in safe agreements from family members. What valuation? Doesn't matter. It's $5,000. I'm just interested if you told him it was worth something at the time. God, I hate safes. Why do you hate safes? Because it's terrible for investors. For the investor, there's no IOU. Hey, I promise to give you equity at some point in the future. With no cap, no interest rate, no discount. I mean, it's just ridiculous. A safe note is just a piece of paper that means nothing. It's not debt like a convertible noted. Sorry, we're going on a tangent on We appreciate that, but I just don't like how mainstream it is. I don't know why everyone's doing it. All right, look, I'll take a flyer on it. There's a bunch of question marks, particularly around production, and we don't have any reviews on the final product shipped. Yeah. So, I got to reflect that in my offer. I'll give you the 250,000 for 20%. What's your lead time right now? Starting with nothing, it's about 17 weeks. Okay. So, that's your biggest challenge, right? It is our biggest challenge because you have uncertainty about your demand. You have uncertainty about the different platforms where you can sell and you have 12 to 17 weeks to turn it around. You can't just like boom boom boom if we got an order from retail. They need a lot of work. Look, I think you guys are great founders to back. It's just too early for me. So, I'm out. Understood. Thank you. My accolades to you, Kelsey, in particular. You're rock solid. I'm going to make an offer from 250 for 20%. That's my offer. Same offer. Same offer. We just have to decide who you want to work with. It's early with me, but with complete belief because I know people like you always product's going to work, but I think it has to get to retail, too. Got two offers. Yes, we do. You know what? I'm going to make you an offer. One shark is out. Barbara and Kevin have each offered 250,000 for 20% of Kowy and Max's cardboard saw for kids, Chop Shop. But Mark may also be interested. You know what? I'm going to make you an offer. You have risk obviously in manufacturing, but you guys are product designers, physical product designers. So, you know that whole process. You'll figure that. Your next biggest challenge is pricing. You have good margins, but you don't quite know how much you're going to sell, but more importantly, you don't know what's involved on the marketing side to get the sales that you want, right? And so, I think you're going to have an opportunity to raise your prices. So, I think you're going to have a ton of margin. And I think if you do this right, it is the hot product of Christmas. And I know in your mind you're already thinking that way, right? But you've got to get it in front of the right people. And I think that that's where I can help. So what's your offer? Okay, so you guys asked for 20%. Right? So and that's probably too much. So I'll ask for 15%. So I'll give you the 250K for 15%. Say yes or no now and we have a deal. Um 250K for 15%. Yeah. This is more than you wanted to give. I know. But right 85% of a watermelon is a whole lot better, right? If you would take the 15%, I would go in with Mark. Really? Mhm. 15% split between the two of you. Mhm. Yep. Because I think you have a lot more coming. I heard you. I listened to you. I love how badass you are. 250,000. Mark and I for 15%. That's an amazing offer. Don't get caught up in a couple percentage points, right? I know when you walk in the door, everybody's got that number, right? But I'm just telling you, between the two of us, the ability to scale and do it quickly and have questions answered for everything and because we've both been there, we'll save you that delta. So, what do you guys think? I think Mark and Lori, you have a deal. Thank you so much. Let's cut this up. Thank you so much. Super stars for sure. All right. Thank you so much. You got this. So, so happy about this. Thank you. Don't leave me hanging. Thank you so much. See you guys. Congrats, guys. Thanks so much. Thank you. Would you bring those boxes with you, please?", "Chill Soda": "[Music] [Music] hi my name is Dan Mackey and I am the creator of chill soda I am seeking a minimum investment of $50,000 for 10% equity chill is a truly healthy line of soda I have some teachers in my family when California was getting rid of sodas from school campuses we saw what they replaced them with these diet sodas that are full of chemicals and no one wants to drink juices full of sugar and they're like is this the best they got if someone wanted to make a boatload of money they should invent a healthy soda oh guess what I did chill is uniquely low glycemic it's organic it has no high fructose corn syrup no simple sugars it's nutritious it's lightened calories it has antioxidants vitamins but the best thing it tastes like regular soda it is good I brought a few samples I'd love for you to taste is there an artificial sweetener in here thanks D there is no artificial sweetener because organic means there's no chemicals nothing artificial whatsoever thank you we use something called agave nectar oh that was pretty good it's good and that's Nutri ious like honey but it's low glycemic and it's actually sweeter than sugar so we're able to get the same sweetness level for less calories how many calories in one can in one can we have 85 calories that's pretty good your typical soda is 140 and a lot of the organic sodas on the market are like 160 180 okay Dan here's a question for you what is the thing that is the ultimate leverage of success for all players in the beverage Market I hope you know know this answer you got to taste good no no no no no incorrect what do you need that you don't have right now and is the reason you're standing in front of me well you got to get this you're going to have to answer it for me cuz distribution shelf space shelf space okay sorry I thought that was a given because you don't have it oh actually I do what do you have we actually already have a distributor on board they're in 40 different territories throughout the United States so we're rocking and rolling already then is there a store that I can go into today and see your product on a shelf there is not because you're getting in on the ground floor of this do you have any sales we already have sold 250 units and we have you know we're still 250 units cases or pieces cans okay how much does 250 50 cans of soda at approximately 40 cents equal well $175,000 whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa how many have you sold 250,000 can 250,000 you said 250 cans I'm sorry yeah that's not very how many dollars how many dollars of have you collected in sales from that so from that we got 175,000 that's not bad Dan you just gave yourself mouth to mouth Dan the 175,000 in sales that you got you told me that it's not available on any shelf so where did you sell the 175,000 to that was sold to the distributor and they're actually helping us with the production run they are so behind us why are

you're not I'm out when you woke up two years ago and said I want to go into a business why did you pick the most brutally competitive consumer goods Market in the world what would make you do that because of the business model behind it part of what I have to do every day is to is to try and find Opportunities where I put money in Harm's Way and I get a return I don't pick places where there are thousands of dead and rotting corpses that's what the beverage industry is it's guys like you getting slaughtered look I don't want to depress you or not give you the motivation you need who are

and our company is deskview we're here seeking a hundred and fifty thousand dollars for seven and a half percent equity sharks we are living in the age of glass new buildings both residential and Commercial they're all glass those drywall conference rooms are now glass fish bolts closed off office spaces are now open concept layouts with all this glass where do you work you consider your

who wants to help me down can it go anywhere that's not glass so we have a couple photos industry works like melamine top surfaces tile so it works on a steel case oh you can use that in the bathroom exactly it works and how does it actually attach it suction for us so what we did is we took the strongest suction disc in the industry and then we recreated and built the housings for it and built some new mechanisms around it what did you sell them for and what what does it cost to make yeah and how many have you sold the White and the bamboo those are minimalist and are natural they retail for 235 235 and our clear baller retails for 265. now what are you and how many have you sold we've sold 800 today 800 000 800 units and how many years we just received our inventory in April of 2018. we didn't mention what you what they cost to make yes so our costs are currently 80 landed for the units but I've been on an absolute binge reducing our costs over the last couple of months and I have them down about 25 to 30 percent but you have great margins 80 versus 230. why not doing such a high margin because you don't need to and you know for a desk like this it seems pretty expensive right this is actually one of the lowest price tests that you can get in an office room so when we talk to people in offices they're actually blown away about how inexpensive it is compared to everything else yours is 235 what's a typical stand-up desk I just don't know what it is I mean your typical full standing desk can range from 500 anywhere up to two thousand dollars they're really expensive we're kind of that add-on into your office or especially in the apartment in your studio apartment we kind of the only option for a standing so like you've sold about seventy thousand dollars all together eighty thousand we're at about 100 C two thousand this month will close 100. that was all on your own 100 we started Marketing in the direct consumer space but strictly on our website what we started noticing is companies were buying dozens of units so at that time we realized okay let's focus on the B2B Market there's a big large Furniture Expo in Chicago we didn't have ten thousand dollars to throw out for a booth so we got Scrappy and we put up four desk use on the side of a coffee shop and so that was in the main thoroughfare there were people coming out of the coffee shop they knew exactly what to do they were using them standing there tell us about you guys how did you come up with this I got my BS with studies at Cornell Harvard and Oxford and then went on and got my JD MBA at the University of Pennsylvania uh went on practiced three years in commercial litigation and then three years in corporate transactional law I got put inside an office that I just couldn't put a standing desk in I it actually went to the doctor and my doctor said Mike you have tendonitis everywhere from the hip down it was from sitting down I mean we were cranking 80 100 hour plus weeks regularly and I was just stuck sitting but I had these floor-to-ceiling windows because we were in a downtown office I was like that's perfect so I started building tinkering I did the first 18 prototypes with 200 in cash good for you so there was some demand especially in my office everyone's like what is that where did you get that started selling those a little bit and it was actually about that time that I met Jason yeah so we met through a mutual friend and he showed me the initial prototype of this and immediately it clicked in my head because I spent the past six years working with companies talking to Executives we want Sandy to ask our employees are demanding them but they're so expensive you're a Furniture guy just uh commercial real estate broker I don't know if I see it as a desk the surface area is just too small hold on one second I'll actually show you another one that because I never stopped working on Innovation but I over time the square foot employee in company offices has gone from 250 square feet down to 120. yeah I I don't disagree with you that's why people want to stand yeah this guy I called the big 14 inches deep yeah so we added a couple more inches for those that have larger than that we're going to price that at 275. can I speak from a perspective of an employer when I built my offices I was meticulous about the design and hated it when my sales people even put their kids in frames on their desk shelves it just messed the whole place up you spend tons of money you want a gorgeous corporate office and then people start bringing the chochka I hated it to a corporate client B2B which is your specific model it's you want someone to buy 50 of them could you imagine 50 of these along the plate glass windows of an office building Midtown Manhattan IC as a consumer individual sale Market I really do so I don't believe frankly in any of the directions you're going in so I'll have to graciously step out I think it's a beautifully designed product you've obviously put an incredible amount of work on it it's so sturdy but you know I'm kind of sitting here and I wouldn't use that as a desk I can't get there I'm out thank you I mean I can see it as a compliment I mean you know to my desk or in my office or someone's coming in from the outside keeping two of them in the closet and setting them up where needed but you know I agree with Barb that I think these more in the home so for those Reasons I'm out great thank you I prefer this selling directly to Consumers online the margins are pretty good I don't mind exploring the um the whole thing B2B but you're going to find out how tough that is and it just it just sucks cash look I'll make you an offer wow I'll give you the 150 000 I want 15 percent thank you for the offer I don't see it as a permanent desk or somebody using it all day long but I thought it was really interesting I actually think for commercial space like you know there's never enough room at a Starbucks or this or that I thought that was really smart but I don't like your price point I've done a lot of products over the years and the one thing I know is things that soar things that really do great are things that are a good idea that people like but if you can give it to them at an affordable price if they're on the fence at all they're going to buy it I respect the margin that you feel you want to make the big question is is really how well can it go so with what I've been able to do over the past couple months plus the volume based discounts we should be at around 45 landed 46 dollars landed so you can cut it in half yeah yes all right I'm going to give you a really Sharky offer I would want to be a third partner 33 000 for 33 and the third percent ouch because I feel like we'd have to go to a million factories and cross this out where it could be something where we'll sell hundreds of thousands of units not thousands there's blood in the water now Mike well yeah and with our with the projections of these you know multi-billion dollar Distributors that we're talking to I mean they're saying they'll move 900 units a month next year they're sales people but here's the difference I don't want them moving 900. I want them moving 90 000. so you guys know the more I think about this the more I listen to Lori I'm modify my offer I'm going up to 20 so I'll give you I'll give you the uh 150 000 for 20 percent this isn't uh gonna be easy because I think it's got to be 99 bucks I'm willing to take a flyer 150 000 20 you can do Lori's deal for 150 000 for 33 and a third you guys have to make a decision [Music] Lori would you do 20. but you want me to put the value add I mean I know it's going to be some heavy lifting from my end I know that because I've done it again and again and again [Music] Kevin we'll take your offer for 20 wow I just felt like okay you were the only one left congrats we're excited wow that surprised me that really surprised me why would they want to do business with Kevin you're the perfect partner well she wanted one third I wanted a third", "Bee D'Vine Honey Wine": "[Music] next up is a modern version of an ancient beverage [Music] hi sharks my name is ayela solomon and i'm from sonoma california my company is the honey wine company producers of b divine i'm seeking 750 000 for 20 of my business for centuries people from all over have been enjoying the world's oldest alcoholic beverage it's made from a simple sustainable naturally sweet ingredient honey that's right it's called honey wine ethiopia where i was born is the largest honey wine drinking country in the world commonly referred to as mead i have perfected the formula every sip of bee divine helps save our endangered bees and promotes a permanent change for thousands of beekeeping households and forests around the world ultra smooth and fragrant be divine is produced in small batches from just two ingredients raw local honey and pure spring water when you sip bee divine you'll experience the taste of exotic floral nectars dancing on your palate i love that i'm ready yes all right so we start from left to right okay on the far left is the brute non-sparkling i'll join you okay this is a shark tank tradition [Applause] so that's the brut brute is remarkably dry and complex and the oak agent gives it a nice mellow vanilla finish the next one is a sweet non-sparkling has mellow tropical fruit flavors cheers wait let's let daniel do one okay go ahead daniel to the chevalier now i just want to make a quick note for those who don't know who the chevrolet de testave is it's a secret wine club of gundam you're trying to figure out a secret very secretive not anymore there's something for everybody that's the beauty of it almost like tasting your honey wine we'll finish it off with the sparkling sweet oh i like this one i like this oh it's really good i like every single one of these oh wow thank you how much does it cost at retail the non-sparkling is 39 retail the sparkling is 49. and how many have you sold in six years now we just over 400 000. over six years dollars worth six years yes how many did you sell last year in the last 12 months we've sold 115 000. why so little about yeah well uh it's uh one by myself doing this i had a full-time job for the first five of the six years there wasn't a huge marketing budget we've put in about six hundred thousand dollars between myself family and some friends wow oh yeah tell us your story on why are you doing this i was born in ethiopia i grew up in kenya my father was in in agriculture and we always in outdoors used to grow up going on safari i came to the u.s i went on to study environmental economics and also have an mba in finance so i was able to put all these things together and come out with a product that would promote my interests and also address some of the environmental and social concerns when you came out i saw honey wine i thought oh kind of a shtick yeah and then i tried it and i loved it now i'll buy it i'm going to guess the problem with your product is people aren't going to buy it until they try it exactly and that's why i think there's a bigger problem i think it's price because 39.95 that's not a price you would sample new wine here's a fact 97 of wine sold in america is sold for under 14 a bottle 97 what's your cost for this bottle uh that's uh 5.93 so why are you selling it so expensively when you can get to that 14.99 price point because uh i mean it's just classical strategy either your small volume high margin or so how's that strategy working for you it's a long term play because this is good something you could change over time and no you've got to have an introductory you've got to have a price point where people can but mark i think you're going down the wrong road i don't think it matters what the price is and yes ninety seven percent of that cost thirty five dollars yeah the problem here is people need to try it well that's that's my point robert mark is right on the money it's that sweet spot of being under 15. right yeah and if it's not what you like you haven't really lost that much exactly i like all wines and i i appreciate the mastery of what you've made here but two big issues here one is getting trial i think robert brought that up breaching the 14 price point is very hard very hard well i mean lowering the price is not going to uh get people to buy more we've experimented with that and it's not sustainable that's ninety-seven percent of the market it's not nineteen let's focus on the issue of valuation you have to ship 50 000 cases to break even how many cases are you shipping yeah well i was doing about four or 500 cases a year or 500 yeah you know what i'm a product person uh i've done wine deals i'm not kevin but i'm not snobby about wines frankly tastes good looks good first white wine i like and i like what it is it's kind of like a dream come true thank you i love that and you're saving the bees so to me i feel like it doesn't really matter the things that you were just saying because you're talking about it this is a hobby it's not a hobby and let me tell you something i have talked with my fellow sharks here's the bottom line we're going to make you an offer yes and the offer is this you're going to get four sharks mark daniel myself and robert okay so we're gonna make you an offer 750 000 but we want 40 10 for each shark for each shark we will help you you need the trajectory the publicity the sales do you know how rare it is that you get four sharks i don't want kevin to be left out and i want to make it's not one we are very comfortable with that i can't do it i i have very complex uh yeah i know kevin o'leary whines there's two things one this is non-negotiable because this is the only way we're gonna get four in so you're gonna have to say yes to the 40. there's no negotiating and two the second goal is other than the environmental issues we're going to destroy o'leary wines we're just going to blow them away whatever he's going to sell we're going to sell four times as much because there's four stars i don't want to put anything in this house you're going to get an education i just want you to do great here's my counter no need meeting some cases listen listen no please understand your numbers make no sense just for 750 thousand dollars we're doing this because we're believing in the long term and because of what laura is saying because the value of four of us working together this is non-negotiable this is a yes or no if i were you i wouldn't even think about that you're like [Music] then let's do this what he did okay you ", "Knife Aid": "Eerste in die tenk is 'n moderne\nweergawe van 'n tradisionele diens Besigheid.

what a beautiful picture it's pretty comfy [Applause] oh yeah see get anybody barbara what are you doing right over there you have no idea what a disappointment [Laughter] you know kevin looks pretty good okay i'm really hot now so have you sold any or is this a brand new invention brand new brand new we've been at this for less than six months you've been sorry you have no sales no sales yet no sales yet we are ready to put in our first major so what is the distribution plan to be completely online at this point that is that's what are you gonna sell it for how much uh 39.99 is retail and what does it cost you to make 13 to make 17 landed 17. not great margin but it comes in one size i appreciate one size one size fits all very easy for manufacturing how low can you get the price we can get as low right now for uh right around 11 how many units about a hundred thousand that's right how'd you come up with it uh well the story goes uh we're both single dads from phoenix believe it or not we invented this in the heat and uh unfortunately i'm going through a divorce we have two beautiful kids the last thing in the world that i wanted and for those first six months after that i was absolutely devastated and so my brother took me in and uh my nephew his son which you see right here that's saxon he was uh sitting on the couch one morning i got up and he was wearing one of my brother's sweatshirts oh and he was up on the couch he had his knees pulled in he had his arms pulled in and i walked by and i'm like oh saxon you look so comfortable and cozy and warm and he's like yeah i am look at my brother and said you think we could make these for adults yeah why not and laying over the back of the couch was a blanket you know fleecy chirp a blanket we looked at and said well why don't we make it out of that material and that's how it was born what was the original let's not mention the other one what was its price at its heyday at its peak i believe it was 19.95 it was the thing is here's the problem for me i love you guys you are funny you are nice you are wonderful but the big elephant in the room for me is the other one that you mentioned it's just like it except as a hood it's not just like it was the other one what was the other one it is absolutely not the snug the thing is the snug is still being sold and and i actually do a lot of business with the people that create it i like products that are unique this is not unique enough i'm sorry i'm out okay thank you you guys know how much money the snuggie made sold 22 million units it's first year 22 million units in its first year the product for everyone but could you please explain to me what the difference between your product is and the snuggie okay so if you're on the couch with the snuggie and you wanted to get up to go do something you have to take it off every time and you're it's open in the back it's like having a robe on backwards we're not knocking the snuggie but this is a significant improvement but that's not the issue for me right i think it's great i think it's comfy i'd like to have one but the problem is even if you get your cost out right you're going to be burning through a lot of cash in order to figure out what works and what doesn't work and so while i think it's great i think you have a lot of work to do before you're ready so for those reasons i'm out all right thank you thank you appreciate it so what is it you don't have the cash to go to production we do no we're ready but this is what you have right now is still a sample do you have the money for the inventory what do you need the 50 000 for today for more inventory yeah but you haven't sold the first inventory no we haven't but they're costing we think we're very careful we are confident i mean we are what's missing from the pitch is the customer acquisition cost selling it for 39.99 it cost me 17 landed right i have that margin to play with but how do i know that's not all gonna be eaten up by customer acquisition cost and until i know what that is i mean it's it's i think we have a product that is uh a potential viral product i mean we're obviously going to take it off everybody says that no one's ever come here stood there and said we suck we suck and we don't have any chance of being viral tell me a little bit about your website or don't you have one we no we do not have it yet because we're about two months away from launching uh we don't even have a final product yet to take pictures of and everything else and we're getting that we're getting that early next the worst answers to the questions but it comes across so nice okay hey we're living the entrepreneurial dream we're in the secret ground right here amen all right robert yeah all right this is your big chance come on robert take a flyer with us love you guys you seem so genuine not gonna have to do any of the work we will do it we'll do the work i i gotta be honest with you i've never seen

robert he said let's do this deal together let's do this i'm like okay and then he makes the offer without me well i was just yeah you weren't starting you start and you finished okay so i'll of course underbid him even though i don't want to just to get rid of him and get even okay 50 for 30 but you do all the work i'm gonna know how to market it i think you hyper focus online and i can help you there because i sell so much product online [Music] barbara would you consider 50 000 for twenty-five percent and you have a deal you know i'd say not no oh wow guys you haven't heard from me yet we haven't there's always the possibility i thought you were out no i'm not out i have not yet robert [Music] but you have two viable offers okay okay [Music] let's go barbara you have a deal let's

sing a song and get 50 000 from barbara we nailed it it happened we got it if you get up and if you get up and get off the couch and do something when you have an idea you can be here too absolutely it's the american dream shark tank and we did it you ", "Haven Lock": "[Music] [Applause] next into the tank is a product to keep Intruders [Music] [Applause] out hi sharks my name is Alex belli and I'm a former Army Special Operations helicopter pilot and the CEO of Haven the world's strongest Smart Lock and my name is Clay bakes I'm the COO of Haven we're from Nashville Tennessee and we're seeking $500,000 in exchange for 6% equity in our business sharks not long ago clay and I both experienced a series of break-ins in our neighborhoods in reality a break-in occurs every 18 seconds here in the United States we quickly realize it doesn't matter if you lock your doors or not the traditional deadbolt just isn't getting the job done let me show you this is your standard deadbolt while it may feel secure when you lock it an experienced Intruder can get in in about five kicks Alex show them how easy this is come on Alex kick it hard come on Alex Alex come on Al kick it how much you sell the Deadlocks [Music] for look like we don't need to buy this product [Laughter] oh hey there go get mad and actually a Breakin occurs every 18 seconds the door knobs about to fall oh yeah that's persistence are you okay this isn't going well are you typically a Breakin can happen in less than 2 minutes in the United States one in 36 homes in America will have a Breakin smart locks based at the deadbolt are no better Alex sure we're going to show you how works as you can tell I'm not an experienced Intruder I'm good okay let's show them how Haven Works clay yeah Haven sits at the bottom of the floor right next to the existing threshold when activated the wedge based barrier lifts up using simple physics this makes your entire door 10 times stronger to preventing home break-ins to use it you simply step on the gate to open the door to shut the door you lock it with the gate with the foot pedal and you can see there's no dead bolt here right so Alex here K show them how it goes do the fly kick [Music] Alex all right sharks no finally got it that's right baby we don't give up all right that's right we don't give service absolutely God Haven is still standing strong we've got some demos we'll show you Alex you've just gone down in Shark Tank history you will be memorialized for connected version Mark you okay hell yeah here you go cool all right I'm going to grab a quick drink of water clay once don't you start so sharks we've got two products that we manufacture we have a Haven mechanical Mech that you have on this side we have an electronic controlled one and Mark's got it down here on this side it's got a key fob just like you have with your car it also has a smartphone app where you can share e keys I would be able to send you access to my house schedule that I would get notification when you come and go what is each cost so our cost for the mechanical only one we sell it on our website for $182 it cost us $67 to make it our landed cost is $82 our profit margin on that is 55% what about the Bluetooth version how much the connect version we sell for $3.49 on our website right now cost of good sold is $175 wow that's a lot think we can get that down it's our our first batch of production at that cost do you have a patent issued on this year yes sir we just got issuance from the UK we're still pending in in the US there's nothing like this that's on the floor floor and that stop somebody enter actually cover the entire door and for sliding doors so could you do it at the top yes ma'am so that's the other exciting thing we want to tell you about is due to recent current events schools started approaching us to put this in individual classrooms huge Market there's over 115,000 schools in this country this is to protect the classroom from anybody getting in our plan is to lock down a classroom within 1 second and give teachers access and give uh security resource officer SWAT team access to the it's actually a really good idea that's a great idea I don't think you told us what our your sales were okay so so far we just crossed the $250,000 Mark of of total sales where are you selling them we sell online on our on our own website how much money have you raised and how much debt do you have we've raised 1.5 million that's a lot wow and how much debt do you have if any we have uh two uh investors with a convertible note debt of a total of $500,000 there we go are you two the sole owners 25% each and then we have investors on top of that with additional Equity to sell so the school situation what is it that you have underway with schools tell them about the purchase order we got in Arkansas so in in Melbourne Arkansas we installed three locks about a month ago they had an open house the parents loved it the next day I got a call from the superintendent and said I've got 94 classrooms left to do in this school I want to put in an order that's a big order they order they order 94 yes ma'am what are you going to do with the money sure so our biggest problem is inventory simply so we're going to use part of your investment to go out and scale inventory with our suppliers guys look I think what you've done is brilliant Mark let's let's do a deal but the challenge is the your economics are awful your margins are awful to support what you what you need to we're just starting our manufacturing we have made 2,000 locks and got those into the customers we paid way over for those first 2,000 we're not going to pay that for the next 10,000 or the next 20,000 I think you're going to have a pretty hard time figuring out how to get the scale and figuring out what works and what doesn't I don't want to be part of the journey I'm sorry I'm out thank you for I think you have a huge mountain to climb and something that I don't think we'd get our money back so for me I'm out thank you Barbara thank you very much appreciate your time pitch yeah guys I just think it's going to be difficult particularly from a cash flow perspective it's going to take you raising your price you know to generate the margins until your costs come down and even then the margins just aren't there guys how about sure I think this is really smart the problem for me is I like to really understand a product when I invest in it and you might be too early I can't invest at this point so I'm sorry I'm out thank you very much for your time you know what come on Dam let's do a deal I'm very interested in it but sometimes it's it's what's in the best interest for the entrepreneur too I can give you a shark deal then you may have to raise more capital and then you get diluted or give them some to start with what do you want let them decide the only reason we're here is to get one of you on this team to guide us to Mentor us to get us into distribution opportunities and help scale our cost down we want you on this team you're not going to like what I'm going to say because me taking more of the company then you own is not in your best interest and I need you to be a little selfish for yourself so I'm not going to give you an offer I'm out thank you Damon thank you sharks good luck guys congratulations I am definitely a customer though this isn't our first objection and it's not going to be our last but there's a problem out there worth solving and we're going to keep going after it we're going to continue on uh the the team follows the motto that I lived in the Army we're never going to quit we have paying customers out there not only residentially but commercially and we're going to keep going ", "Rule Breaker Snacks": "[Music] next up is a way to cheat without feeling the guilt [Music] hi sharks i'm nancy kalisch from brooklyn new york and i'm here asking for four hundred thousand dollars in exchange for ten percent of my company rule breaker snacks we make delectable better for you brownies and blondies so as chief rule breaker it's my job to break some rules like who says you have to feel guilty just because you eat an indulgent snack you don't if it's one of ours how do we get away with it well let's examine some typical ingredients in brownies and blondies take eggs for example oh they're no eggs in rule breaker and butter oh there's no butter either [Music] in fact no animal products at all sugar well there is some sugar but not too much and it's not our first ingredient the way it is in some other so-called better for you snack brands so what is our first ingredient it's chickpeas yes beans but rule breaker snacks are so chewy and delicious you'd never guess being 100 plant-based is better for the planet and better for us but there are some rules we never break such as those that keep our snacks safe for school so rule breaker contains no nuts [Music] in fact none of the common food allergens and no gmos no preservatives but they taste absolutely incredible look at all those big chocolate chips who wants to come break some rules with me please dig into the samples in front of you you have deep chocolate brownies which are like fudgy hunks of heaven studded with chocolate chips chocolate chunk blondies which are like soft baked chewy chocolate chip cookies birthday cake blondies which have white chocolate chips then peanutter chocolate chip which tastes like peanut butter but it's nut free now let's see how this goes ready i am the ultimate connoisseur of this kind of cookie song wow they really taste like they thought they were going to taste like sand they taste pretty good very good how are you getting that hint of peanut in there well i if i really told you i'd have to kill you but i'll give you a hint we use some sunflower butter ground up sunflowers and a little other magic by roasting our chickpeas in a certain way that brings out their natural nuttiness you know i i mean wow then it says this is 250 calories yeah what would the normal cookie around this size with all the bad stuff in it be around well it's like at least you know 300 400 calories let's see what not for this size it's not gonna be 300 plus calories it's probably gonna be 190 calories some a little bit more some a little less so where is the advantage well okay so one huge advantage is being allergen free and nut free okay another thing is being 100 plant-based it really is better for the planet chickpeas are a super sustainable crop they use really little water how did you come up with the idea all right so um i actually never thought i would be in the food business i was in the magazine business for a long time i was an editor at cosmopolitan and a bunch of other magazines i wrote a bunch of books like nice girl's guide to sensational sex some other books and then i became a health journalist and so i had interviewed literally hundreds of doctors nutritionists dietitians and i knew exactly what to eat to be healthy and i have always had the worst sweet tooth and i just decided for myself i was getting a little tired of being a journalist frankly so i actually thought to myself how hard could it be to start a food company i'll do that it's brutal really and something that's an understatement isn't it nancy where did you start selling your cookies i booked a booth at one of the huge trade shows and managed to get my cookies made and found a co-packer and got my packaging done and luckily i was discovered by the buyer for whole foods northeast and only problem was that our products at that point have uh had a very short shelf life and they had now they're shelf stable but they had to be delivered frozen to whole foods wow that was hard and the distributor had made a mistake and stored them at room temperature so they arrived the first order arrived at 40. it's in the northeast spoiled we're laughing about it now i almost fainted and luckily i had a huge stash of product at my house so i just got in my car and i started driving to whole foods all over here and pulled the spoiled stuff off the shelf and then replaced it that's called details i'm surprised you weren't arrested for shopping i know right how long ago was this nancy this was about four and a half years ago nancy that's a crazy chicken story so how much have you sold to date so our lifetime sales is 1.3 million okay 1.3 million yeah nice great last year we did 500 000. did you make any money on the 500 000 last year no we're still not profitable we are on track to break even next september we got into the biggest supermarket chain in the u.s how was the sell-through we sold i think 70 000 units last year wow what does it take to break even it's gonna take till we reach about 1.7 million dollars in sales how much money did you put in the business so my total investment is i put in 1.6 million dollars on my own money shut the door was this your own money yes 10 points a lot of cookies no balls no babies do you have any other debt as well i do i have an sba loan for 123 000 i also have um a home equity line of credit which i draw on and then oh my goodness how much home equity credit have you used up for this uh right now it's about 600 i guess oh so you're in for 2.35 what is your biggest expense are there any large singular expenses trade spend basically promotions um couponing slotting fees no sucker for that still making packer issues oh i'm so sorry which i've solved by the way but yeah okay let's talk about your margins right because they're 53 okay wait one of these the retail price to a consumer is is a dollar ninety nine to 299 what do you sell it to the grocery store for 105. dollar five and it cost you 50 uh 50 cents so you got to sell a boatload of cookies in order to do this you're right your margin is double oil your actual margin is probably about 15 you could ship this directly to the customer and forget about grocery completely that model actually exists we had already been selling on amazon and doing pretty well every month it was 35 of our business in january now it's 55 of our business you know um i wasn't crazy about the flavor profile the peanut butter one tastes like a protein shake a little bit i mean i understand you have to sacrifice flavor for the health but you don't want a partner who is not really in love and obsessed with the product this is just not for me so i'm out okay thank you damon i think you've done an amazing job you've created a product that i happen to really like but i just think it would be a really really long time before i would see my money back i will be a customer but unfortunately i'm out thank you well i want you to know i am very open to alone yeah but but but nancy look look you're you're repeating your same mistakes you're gonna have to go against your home equity loan some more and that is terrifying and it should be terrifying because effectively you're putting your home at risk now and so please be careful right but for those reasons amounts okay thank you anyway mark what i love about you and i'm sitting here dying to give you money is you're so damn happy i would be miserable well i'll tell you barbara honestly and truly uh my eyes pop open every morning at 5 00 a.m and i cannot wait to get to my death good for you but that same optimism is what got you into the debt in the first place you're asking all of us to buy into a debt more than a business and so for that reason i'm at also okay thank you anyway barbara your business is worth between 800 and a million dollars okay so to give you uh 400 000 i'd have to get 50 of it this is uninvestable as it stands right now if you only want to sell 10 or 20 of the business that's worth 100 grand the rest you have to take on is dead i mean i'm feeling guilty just thinking about that offer and i'm sorry nancy i just i can't go down the journey with you um i'm sorry i'm out okay well thank you anyway we wish you the best nancy all the best yeah good luck with it all right all right bye guys good luck congratulations nancy so i didn't get a deal but i got a lot of great advice from the sharks and i'm certainly going to take it they talked about focusing my business online which is how i want to go and it's a clear path forward to success and breaking the rules far into the future rule breaker is where chickpeas go to die you ", "The Cereal Killerz Kitchen": "next up are entrepreneurs with a product they believe is to die for oh hello scary oh i get it hi sharks we're your worst nightmares we're serial killers and i'm invading your sweet cereal dreams and i'm stalking your morning cereal bowl [Music] just kidding hi i'm serial killer jeff and i'm serial killer chris we're here from north las vegas nevada seeking 125 000 for 10 of our company the serial killer's kitchen we are the first and only cereal bar in las vegas wait what's a cereal bar it's a place where your childhood dreams can come true think back it's saturday morning your favorite cartoons are on and you rush to the kitchen to prepare the perfect handcrafted bowl of cereal just when you thought saturdays couldn't get any better and comes the serial killer's kitchen where every day is saturday at the serial killer's kitchen the opportunities are endless you can mix over 140 different cereals 50 toppings into cereal bowls waffles iced coffees ice cream and milkshakes you name it your cereal dreams can come true with any combination sharks now's your time to kill it and join us on our crazy quest to take over the cereal world one bowl at a time what do we have we have three different things so you have our signature shake so this one is like our most popular so pretty much it's hazelnut nutella chocolate caramel what is in this okay so what you would love that you're gonna love this on robert so we heard that you love peanut butter and now you have it every morning so we gave you a peanut butter lover's dream in your particular ice cream it does have chocolate and then we added a scoop of peanut butter really really really good okay how many calories in that peanut butter thing uh probably between 500 and 5 000. so yeah this is like milkshakes like sundaes like this is you're combining everything ice cream yeah we do pretty much just a big difference with pretty much cereal bar but we can do so many different things i want to know what we're investing is is a retail location what are you doing here okay uh we have one open already we're opening our second location so you have one physical location but you just opened another one yeah we're opening another one and then uh we're pretty much in negotiations for our next three i mean you know the the question everyone's gonna ask yeah are you even open right now yes so we've been back open for about a month and a half now uh because we were shut down for three months our first location is in a dreaded mall so the malls were completely shut down no one can go in or out is that location even going to survive uh honestly probably not but we have we already have a contingency plan for that what's the plan uh we're opening up another store right across the street how are you guys going to afford all this just leftover money that we have because with our plan you know it's taking about 25 000 to remodel these stores how much cash do you have left uh personally about probably about forty fifty thousand how did you come up with this idea i've always loved cereal uh we do have a daughter that does have a mild case of down syndrome and she's she's a chef in her head so she's always like what do you guys want for what do you guys want for breakfast but she's always like cinnamon toast crunch so that's i was like you know what i've always thought it should have been a cereal bar so we started doing the research it was just like hey let's try to do it so what's your background though tell us about you so i was in insurance for about 12 years it wasn't something that made me happy i didn't love it i was going to quit um and the next thing you know i get fired two weeks before our wedding oh no what happened um honestly my performance wasn't there it was like i could not commit to something i hated doing every day anymore well the first time i've heard somebody take responsibility for being that i like your honesty i respect that and for me i grew up in vegas lived in uh richmond california for a little while uh when we lived in richmond you know things were you know probably worse you can get we were homeless lived in plenty of homeless shelters rescue missions uh couchsurf family to family but uh i probably went to nine different middle schools i couldn't read but now something clicked i read went to college got on the dean's list three seven so it was like hey you know we need to get this up so we can take care of our family and especially having a daughter with down syndrome you know it is my stepdaughter but that's my pride and joy like that's really what made me become a man this is not a proprietary concept i mean it's a great idea i get it but others could do it obviously i have a feeling that none of these locations that you have so far make money yet right well the second one's not open because we put up the first there is no location right now the one of them all is in the mall yes how much is that losing a month probably right now about 8 000 a month losing yeah and that one i want to just say to you um your story very moving because you have just come from remarkable odds if i were betting on entrepreneurs i would bet on you 100 thank you i have one conflict here i did a deal with an oatmeal breakfast bar place and so unfortunately i try not to do something that is a conflict with something that we are trying to build and so only for that reason i have to be out i think what you're trying to do is extremely difficult you're trying to open retail and create a brand and pull people in that is an uphill battle if anybody's going to do it it's probably going to be you guys but i'm not sure i have the stomach for that kind of investment i'm out you're very very very early i mean the product tastes great thank you i appreciate that but until you have a profitable location you're not investible okay you've got to prove it with one place you haven't done that yet i'm sorry guys it's not for me right now i'm out okay you know here's my thought i'm you know i'm i'm getting emotionally tied into the the deal because he loves it you know because of things you said this has been in my in my family's life for probably 25 30 years i knew i wasn't that good for you but he's not a quitter that's the day i'm sure hold on you know this is a 3x you know we used to wear big three x's back man after covert i'll be wearing three eggs how you gonna say no oh you can't be out come on damon everybody loves cereal who doesn't love cereal that's the easiest market problem is the cereal look in my house when daddy has to cook it's always cereal right that's just the way it works but i'm afraid for you right i'm just going to be brutally honest you guys are grinders and now you're looking at opening up more stores because you have the sense that when you get more stores open you'll get more revenue and your costs will go down and somehow it'll work out it doesn't work that way though now you've got this other 40 or 50 000 that you've got saved up which is your whole life everything and you're saying i'm all in which sounds really good to show you're committed but when you said you know i'm figuring it out you can't do it that way that you're burning that money because if you can't get one right it's impossible to do two three or four yes sir you're not ready to take investment so for those reasons i'm out but please before you open up any stores get somebody to work for you with you partner with you that is an expert in accounting that has legal background that can get you through these steps because that 40 to 50 000 for your kids for your future is everything [Music] my biggest challenge with you is that you do look spread a little thin you know listen it's a long road ahead right i do believe your business will hopefully get better in vegas it's actually a great company for you but i don't think it's investable or beneficial for an investor so i'm out okay thank you sir thank you i'm sorry thank you for for everything we really appreciate again good luck good luck good luck guys i'll be stopping we gave it our best we did good we're gonna be the biggest cereal company in the world one bowl at a time one bowl at a time i am a little disappointed that we didn't make a deal but still positive i still think that with the feedback they gave us and with our tenacity we're just going to keep pushing forward keep moving forward and try our best to just survive in these current times you ", "Ta Ta Towels": "[Applause] next up is a solution to a problem some well-endowed women face [Music] hi sharks my name is aaron robertson i'm from los angeles california and i'm seeking 200 000 for 10 equity in my company i'm in the business of keeping boobs high and dry that's right boob sweat i know it doesn't sound very attractive and trust me it does not feel very attractive either but it is something that's very real for so many women one hot summer day i was getting ready to go on a date and i could not stop sweating fresh out of the shower i grabbed my t-shirt and i put it on i tucked it underneath my girls but that just made me even hotter the struggle is real so i came up with a solution of my own the tata towel that's right it's a towel for your tatas whoa oh my goodness damon's gonna be so upset he's not here the tata towel is terry cloth on one side and a super soft liner on the other making it reversible it's like your girls are on vacation lounging in hammocks somewhere and who doesn't love a good vacation so sharks who wants to join me in the booby business and get your hands on my tata towels they walk around outside like that i came up with it just for getting out of the shower and i just figured for around the house however i have had some amazing customers and women who buy these and they are wearing them everywhere so you cinch it tighter from the neck and also tighten it underneath absolutely and you can wiggle move dance around and your girls will stay can you bend down because absolutely do the girls have to be the smallest size is a small or a big c the biggest size it goes up to is an h wow let me pass these out first all right this is for you thank you i could try this on kevin's head though it's well the same kevin this is for you we thought you might want to feel how it really feels i really don't need one of these at all but you know what they make great gifts i could see this working oh there you go yeah see there you go it looks really good on you oh my god did you put a patent on these little puppies yes sir i have a patent and a trademark registered here and in china is it a design patent or design patent and for the original which you have and then the second towel that you have is my second patent pending for maternity what does it sell for the originals sell for 45 and the maternity sell for 50. what does it cost you to make 24 how many that's high 12 months i've sold 1.1 million wow wow you're kidding me it costs you 20. congratulations thank you for saying that you're selling them all online i sell them only exclusively from my website you've got to be just crushing it and rolling in the dough right now it's been life-changing right before this happened i've been a personal assistant for 13 years hated my life it was really difficult job so i quit and i was making all of these in my living room i youtubed how to sew i couldn't even thread the needle or like get it in there and i started making them myself you're amazing wow thank you um when i first came up with this i started handing them out and then out of nowhere i don't know who got their hands on these towels but all of a sudden whenever i get a sale on my phone something would just drop down right like ding sale ding sale and all of a sudden i just say and i thought my phone was broken like las vegas so my neighbor runs out and she's like have you been online you are everywhere oh so it just it went viral on its own on its own do you manufacture here domestically i am proud to say i manufacture in los angeles they are handmade by women for women in an eco-friendly manufacturer do you think you can increase the price because it's domestically made by hand yeah because your margins are low honestly what set me back in the beginning is i went viral right and i did not know what i was doing everyone took advantage of that and jumped on and tried to rip me off and steal so i had to take a break did you i was your patent so we enforced my patent what are you going to sell this year we're on track to sell 2 million and what are your sales year to date 188 000 for the year wait wait wait wait wait okay so you're gonna go from 180 000 in the first six months to two million for the rest of the year absolutely we have so many people from all over the world like i said i had to close down how are you gonna do that i'm still trying to get my head around going from 108 thousand six months to two million well the reason is is that first of all the towels really work but that's not the problem we all assume it works you have to make it to get the two million in sales and you've only got six months yeah oh i have uh inventory on hand how much you have two million dollars worth of inventory right now 250 000. here's the problem a lot of things aren't adding up right now you had this viral moment that propelled sales in a short period of time to a million dollars you come into this year and you don't have the viral moment and you have all the aggravation of shutting down all the knockoffs but 250 000 in inventory equals a half a million dollars in sales so you've got to be able to turn your inventory four times basically well isn't qvc great i mean i'm ready for them i've got the product have you talked to them no wait i don't think there's any way in the world that you're getting to two million dollars in sales unless you have another one of those viral moments well that's why i'm here honestly is i'm not afraid to say that like i have this inventory i don't know what to do with it they are selling sales are consistent but it's not just viral it's also going global like i said forget about global global shock see and then you see you're kind of making my case right because to think that the world is your oyster and if you only sell the entire world then you're going to get two million it doesn't really work that way you're just a little bit too scattered for me so for those reasons i'm out okay well thank you aaron the words i have all this inventory i don't know what to do with it it's pretty scary to an investor yeah i shouldn't have said i don't know what to do with it i know but you did say it and what doesn't mean that you have to be punished for it what it means though is there's no strategic plan it's not selling aaron however when i went viral that inventory i'm sitting on would be completely you can't predict viral you're right so i prepared for it now so now i have the inventory and you keep saying i went viral you're answering future problems with past solutions i am here because this is how far i've gotten your strategy is hope and hope is great but in business hope is not really a great strategy i'm out okay thank you thank you aaron you're you're a product person with a great idea but i'm looking for the person that is going to show me exactly how i'm getting to 2 million in sales i really struggle with it because i like it and you know i didn't know about large sweat issues and now i do and that's great and you know i learned something today but i can't work today kevin it's not even worth 200 000 you haven't proven out what you can do here it's worth 250 she'll sell her inventory erin i'm really sorry it's a great product but i'm out okay aaron the part that concerns me is no one wants to buy into a business when the sales is sliding versus going up sorry to say i'm out okay well there's one shark left what are you going to do lori well erin i will tell you what my thought is you had me at hello i get it i get this product but my offer is commensurate to the work that we're gonna have to do okay okay so i want to be a 50 50 partner [Music] four sharks are out laurie is interested in tata towel a towel to combat under boob sweat but she wants half the business so i want to be a 50 50 partner i will make you a millionaire because that's what i do um i mean i would just love to jump with that because it's amazing and i really do want to work with you giving up 50 of my company is just something that i really can't do at this moment uh would you take a fifteen percent oh my god twenty percent oh my god i know remember son okay your business has slowed dramatically you need an army to help you i've got an army is there any scenario where you give her 50 you increase the money perhaps is there any scenario um 50 no because when i was broke and couldn't pay bills i took an investor and i gave them 10 so i own 90 percent listen i'm gonna work best offer 240 percent and my army listen you're gonna make so much money you're not gonna mind uh would you do thirty fifty percent of a watermelon is a whole lot better than ninety percent of a grape like that yeah i've got watermelons in here by the way you're not going to be sorry i won't be sorry would you be able to go up in the money then if i give you that much give her a chance that's her option let her speak so your final offer is two hundred thousand forty percent but you will blow this up erin it's not gonna make a difference ten percent either way make a decision but also erin you have to be happy with it you're absolutely right look i am so happy for this offer i need the help like you said i've made a lot of mistakes what are you gonna do i'm gonna i'm gonna take her off her yay all right thank you guys what kind of melons are those they're mid-sized but they're very comfortable my dad told me not to cry that's okay you can cry i'm going to cry too congratulations there congratulations [Music] i'm just feeling really grateful this has been a really hard road and i really believe in this product and i know it works so so well and to be able to get a deal with the shark that i wanted is perfect you ", "Incredible Eats": "Volgende is 'n plaasvervanger vir\nmiljoene weggooigoed. Hallo Haaie. My naam is Dinesh\nTaripally, medestigter van Incredible Leads en\nEk is van Planeet Aarde. Ek is hier om deel 7% van die ekwiteit van ons ongelooflike\nmaatskappy vir $ 500,000. Haaie regoor die w\u00eareld,\n'n verbysterende hoeveelheid mense is eet hul kos met eenmalig gebruik\nplastiek gereedskap. Maar hoekom gebruik ons iets net vir 'n paar minute as\ndit gaan honderde jare neem om te ontbind? Haaie. Dis 'n oomblik aan die linkerkant,\nmaar 'n leeftyd op 'n stortingsterrein. Dit is hoekom ons met ongelooflike vorendag gekom het\nEetgerei Die w\u00eareld se eerste mis\nvervaardigbare, Heeltemal eetbare eetgerei. Wow\ndie haaie. Nou mag jy jou eet lepel, eet jou strooi,\neet jou spork, en eet selfs jou eetstokkies. Het ek nodig\nS\u00ea meer? My vraag is nie wie wil nie\nbel\u00ea in ons, maar wie wil graag by ons aansluit\nred die planeet? Een strooi of een lepel op 'n slag.\nGoed, haaie, Probeer asseblief al ons eetgerei in\nverskillende geure met verskillende soorte kos. Wat eet ons\nHier? Wie gee om? Ek gaan 'n spork eet. Dinesh.\nHoe lank neem dit vir dit om ontbind? Ja\nso bly elke lepel ferm vir tot 20 minute in warm sop soos 'n warm\nKos en sowat 'n uur in 'n roomys.\nHulle is dus redelik stabiel genoeg vir jy moet daarmee eet en dit dan eet\nNa. Dit is baie goed, dankie. Kalorie\u00eb per eetstokkie,\neetstokkies ongeveer 15 kalorie\u00eb. Ek het een lepel hier en dit was fantasties\nDit was soos 'n pittige pizza gegeur broodstokkies. Ek sou eintlik wou\nom dit te koop en te eet, selfs as die gereedskap. Toe was hierdie een in die\nroomys en hierdie een het 'n vanielje geur en dit smaak soos 'n wafel\nke\u00ebl so dit is heerlik. Dan het ons het hier wat is hierdie een wat 'n\nStrooi en wat is die geur? Dit is eintlik smaakloos, so jy is\nbekommerd oor die geur van hierdie benewens hul funksionaliteit.\nOns konsep is dus om dit te behou subtiel omdat ons aanvanklike. Eerste jaar van ons verkope is\nheeltemal gefokus op voedseldiens want dis waar die swaarste\ngebruik van plastiek is en hulle wou dit om baie subtiel te wees,\nnie te aanmatigend nie, want hulle wil nie die kos wat jy verander, verander nie\neet met, nie waar nie? Wat kos dit vir jou om dit te maak?\nEn waarvoor verkoop jy dit? Ongeveer $ 0.20 om die lepel en ons te koop\nKoste van goedere is $ 0.10. Wat kos differensiaal sou dit wees tussen\nbaie groot volume plastieklepels teenoor hierdie eetbare lepel? Ja\n'n plastieklepel neig om een tot twee sent per lepel,\nmaar ons produk het die vermo\u00eb om maak addisionele winste aan die\nMaatskappy. Kom ons s\u00ea byvoorbeeld,\n'n baie groot roomysketting bestel 100 miljoen lepels. As hulle verkoop\ndit aan hul verbruiker vir vyf sent, hulle maak 5 miljoen wins en ons\nmaak ook wins. Maar wat sou dit doen? kos my as ek nie wou verkoop nie\nas 'n groot roomysmaatskappy? Ek het 100 miljoen hiervan gekoop.\nWat is my delta? Wat is my verskil in prys?\nOns het dus met $ 0.35 begin. Ons het reeds het dit tot $ 0.20 verlaag. Ons is\ngaan dit tot $ 0.15 verlaag. Dis duur,\nEk dink. Maar het jy enigiets verkoop Nog? Ek het tot dusver 1,2 miljoen lepel verkoop,\n2 tot 2 1/2 jaar. Wat is dit in Dollar? Wat, $ 170,000? En waar verkoop jy dit? Ja\nso 2019, dit was heeltemal B2B-voedseldiens\nwant dit is waar die meeste van die plastiek is. En dit gaan goed met ons.\nOns het ongelooflike trekkrag gehad. En dan die COVID-treffer en dit is gegee\ngeleentheid vir ons omdat ons kon verken B2C en direk aan die verbruiker.\nEk het twee naweke deurgebring, ses boeke gelees, my eie verpakking ontwerp,\nmy eie webwerf ontwerp. Jy doen nie weet wanneer jy dit sien dat dit is\nEetbare. Niemand weet dit totdat jy Vertel hulle. Daar is dus 'n redelike bedrag\nvan onderwys wat gaan moet Gebeur. En gaan hier na die kant van skaal,\ntoe u oor 100 miljoen gepraat het stukke en ek is die roomys,\nwat dit ook al is, die B2B speel besigheid tot besigheid,\nEk gaan myself moet afvra: wil ek $ 0.02 betaal vir die\nplastiek of wil ek 10 keer betaal meer hiervoor?\nEn dan almal opvoed wat nie net kan jy die roomys eet,\njy kan die lepel eet wat jy het dit mee opgeskep. Daar is baie\nwerk daar. Goed Wag \u2019n minuut. As jy kreatief was,\njy sal weet dat jy kan indruk en afdruk in die\nlepel en in elke stuk wat s\u00ea: maar wil ek 20 keer meer betaal\nof dit die teken het, eet my daarop of nie? 'n Kwessie lyk so opgewonde om hier te wees\nVandag. Ja. So dit is my droom om wees hier. Ek is 'n immigrant uit Indi\u00eb,\nen ek werk nog steeds. En ek was druk dit van so 7:00 tot\n03:00 elke dag vir die afgelope twee en 'n half jaar. En ek voel\nso trots dat ek verminder of vervang het 1,000,\n000 plastiek gereedskap. En ek het gevind die doel van my lewe. Ek het die\ndoel van my lewe. Dis wat maak my meer gelukkig. Daar is 100\nmiljoen plastiekgereedskap weggedoen elke liewe dag. En met ons\npatent en IP, Ons maatskappy gaan die\nplaneet en die manier waarop mense hul eet Kos. OUKEI\nkom ons gaan terug na geld, want Dit is 'n ernstige stuk verandering.\nEk sal jou baie graag wil ken Agtergrond. Ek is mal oor al hierdie goed\noor, jy weet, hoe wonderlik is dit nie. Maar ek wil my h\u00ea\ngeld, geld, geld, Geld. Kom ons hou op. Ek het teruggegaan na\nGeld Kevin. Dit is baie belangrik. Ek weet\nGeld is baie waardevol. So. OK, So Laurie, ek is in Indi\u00eb gebore,\nen my pa het my die waarde van inhoud en geluk. En hy het ges\u00ea\ngeluk is hier, Nie hier nie. So ek het na die VSA gekom vir my\nmeesters en toe studeer ek. Ek het in 'n tegnologie begin werk\nmaatskappy in die Baai. Meesters was in elektriese\nIngenieurswese. Ek het besluit ek moet Sorg daarvoor, want my kinders\ntoekoms is op die spel. Dit gaan nie oor soos ja geld is lekker,\ngeld is goed om te h\u00ea, maar stel jou voor een roomysketting of\neen restaurantketting wat dit verander om eetgerei te eet en geld te maak.\nDit gaan 'n omwenteling in die hele w\u00eareld. Jou entoesiasme is so absoluut\nHeerlike maar ek voel dat jy verblind word deur\njou eie entoesiasme. Ek dink jy vra baie van 'n\nrestaurant om in die lepel te gaan verkoop ook besigheid en om te neem\nhul miskien een sent of selfs die helfte sent koste van hierdie kos en tot\n$ 0.20 per lepel. En so dink ek jy het baie uitdagings daar wat\nis teen die norm en super kreatief, waarvoor ek jou prys,\nmaar ek is nie seker of hulle prakties is nie genoeg om te vlieg. En so vir di\u00e9\nredes, ek is uit. Dinesh,\nEk stem nie saam met Barbara daaroor nie Punt. En laat ek jou vertel hoekom dit\npassie is presies wat gaan laat jou slaag. Die rede hoekom ek is\nsukkel is jy weet, jy het nie bewys dat dit regtig\ncool konsep is skaalbaar vir die wys daarop dat Mister Wang wat ges\u00ea het:\nmaar jy het evaluering toegereken, Dit is bewys dat dit skaalbaar is.\nDie gaping tussen jou visie en jou verwagtinge van ons as beleggers is\nweg na weg, weg, heeltemal te wyd. Ek moet dit evalueer\nnie as 'n droom nie, maar as 'n besigheid met $ 170,\n000 in lewenslange verkope. Dit is nie die moeite werd nie Van $ 7.1 miljoen. So\nDaniel Ek het niks aan bemarking bestee nie.\nEk het 'n groot vermo\u00eb om te maak dit is noodsaaklik omdat dit so 'n\ninteressante produk. Ek het net spandeer twee jaar om die beste produk te maak\nwat daar is. Ek dink jy gaan om te wen,\nmaar ek gaan nie inkom as 'n belegger hierdie dorp. Ek is jammer, maar ek is nie.

So as jy 'n\nslaai, as jy roomys koop, As jy alles by 'n kruideniersware koop\nWinkel jy is reg langs die voorafverpakte\nVoedsel. En daar is dit. Wil jy die\nplaneet en sit 'n strepieskode daarop en verkoop dit individueel?\nJy verkoop dit net, reg? So ek gaan vir jou 'n aanbod maak,\nmaar dit gaan baie van my verg Tyd.

", "Genius Juice": "[Applause] first into the tank is a genius idea in the beverage space hello sharks my name is alex bear i'm the founder and ceo of genius juice we are seeking 250 000 in exchange for 7 equity instead of talking about our product we're going to sing about it and here we go [Music] coconut coconut coconut coconut smoothie up so creamy whole coconut and a drink it's amazing everything but the shell it's pure genius genius juice is the first product to include whole coconut in every bottle unlike regular coconut water we freshly crack open organic young thai coconut and blend together the coconut water and the coconut meat it's from tree to bottle within five hours or less it's truly pure genius so who wants to join us on our genius journey nice job [Applause] thank you thank goodness for their voices i'll get you guys some samples there you go this is the the three flavors original i'll take one of each one of each puppet yep there you go thank you lori you can take the ones on your right and also there's straws here just a wonderful thank you so much i think i can guess what's new so there's three flavors the green one is the original and then turmeric and also coffee all of them have whole coconut in it coconut water this is a full coconut in here yeah there's a full coconut in every bottle how many calories is this thing it's about 100 calories per bottle any added sugar no added sugar anything added at all no there's no added natural flavors no gums no junk the original which is the green one that's coconut water coconut meat so delicious thank you yeah once you get in the mindset of a smoothie and you're drinking a smoothie then it's good it could be a meal replacement and also the benefits of having not only just coconut water which is potassium and electrolytes but having the coconut meat is hitting on a lot of great trends and it's only 100 calories 100 calories i could eat this for lunch it's only 100 calories what do you sell each bottle of coconut water for the retail price and what does it cost to make yup so the coconut smoothie we sell at retail between 4.99 and 5.99 that's in the retail store our cost to make it is a dollar 87 and you have a co-packer that's doing this coconut blending yeah what's amazing is we have a manufacturing partner that is in thailand at the source about two miles from where the coconuts grow they source it at its peak in nutrition and freshness they cut open the coconuts they extract the water in the meat and they blend it and bottle it what preservative do you have in it so it makes it across the ocean so there's no uh there's no preservatives it's refrigerated transportation it's actually frozen so we pasteurize it and when it's ready to go to the stores we thaw it and it goes right to the stores that makes it really tough because you got to get refrigeration space well with distribution we are with two of the largest natural distributors in the country we are currently in about 1100 stores our distribution strategy is one of my mentors told me inch wide mile deep it's not about going into a ton of stores totaling about going in the stores where your product will actually sell best what are you selling in those 1100 stores how much last year we did 367 000 yep total this year uh so far halfway into the year we're at three hundred and twenty thousand you're probably gonna double you think potentially i think we're gonna triple it because we're launching uh also in 400 new locations at the end of next month and that's vons and pavilions and albertsons on the stores that you've already sold to are they constantly reordering yeah yeah we get reorders every single week so assuming you're going to triple let's call it a mil ski you're going to do a million bucks this year okay how much are you going to make on the mill ski so are you going to lose in the middle we are not going to be net profitable until about 2.5 million 2.5 mil yeah that's going to be our our break evening point how do i give this evaluation of 3.5 million because you're saying 250 for seven percent computes a three and a half million dollar valuation we are projecting to do six million next year so i'm going to make an assumption you have a little flexibility on valuation right there is some flexibility i thought so yeah because i would love to partner up there should be a lot of questions that you're going to need a lot more money than 250 000 exactly yeah the 250 000 is going to be enough money to get to a series a raise however i'm definitely that if there is a larger investment we can get there together i'm all ears does anybody else do a coconut smoothie no one else actually does this how much money have you put into the business alex yeah about 1.3 million wow that's a lot of money yeah you could you you would need to not personally i don't know i myself put 150 000 and what do you own in the business at this point so myself and a family member we own about 87 have you been dealing with any retailers about three years ago we were at a co-packer here in los angeles and we were in about 450 stores at that time and they were it was very abusive they were up charging us they were moving us around we were forced to leave so we had no one to make our product we lost all our shelf space in the 450 stores so i was able to arrange a deal with our manufacturing partners before they were just supplying us coconuts they not only invested in us they built machinery out and made the product and by mid-2017 they were online they invested in us and i also managed to get almost all of our shelf space back what percentage of their your equity they own right now they're on a convertible note so it's going to equate to about three to four percent wow what's your ultimate pain point and what's your ultimate need yeah the pain point right now is not having enough marketing dollars you're going to spend the whole 250 on marketing we're going to spend about 65 percent on production yeah and about 30 on marketing and five years you're gonna have to do multiple rounds as distribution grows just for inventory too right absolutely i love the packaging i love the look i love the logo everything i think it's really really great i do think though the beverage industry is very competitive and i just don't think i have the expertise here to help you i'm sorry i'm out thank you lori i think the product is good but food for thought the refrigeration is definitely a concern well i look at this refrigerator it scares me well there's a lot of brands that you have invested in that are refrigerated they still scare me and they've actually they've really taken even more i've spent a lot of work for you know to to push those brands to get to scale so now i was involved in vita coco coconut water can get scalable vitacoco's you know doing hundreds of millions of dollars in sales at the moment the reason that it did so well was shelf stable my gut operationally is telling me this is gonna be a much longer slot than you think and so unfortunately i'm up alex does that discourage you hearing that from the guy in the business not at all there's plenty of refrigerated beverages that have grown and exited alex i invest in two different soda companies about three years apart i put my heart and soul into it in the end they ran out of money the money went south and i swore to myself i would never ever invest in any kind of a beverage company again right but there's a few things here that are tempting me [Music] two sharks are out but barbara may be interested in alex's coconut smoothie company genius juice i swore to myself i would never ever invest in any kind of a beverage company again right but i love that this stamp thing is so delicious this coconut is the best i've ever had it's nothing else like creamy delicious juice i swear i'm drinking a thousand calories but it's 100 calories that's great all right and so for that reason i'm gonna go against my gut and i'm gonna make you an offer but the seven percent isn't gonna get me up in the mornings i'll give you 250 000 but i want 14 percent ouch that's not a ouch i would i was interested but i would ask for more and so i'll defer to barbs and she's asking for less so for those reasons i'm out okay thank you mark i hate beverage deals because of the distribution problems and all the other stuff we're talking about but this is good stuff thank you here's the problem with the deal i know you're gonna have to keep raising money till the cows come home so if i give you 250 000 for seven percent for three and a half mil valuation i'm just going to get diluted into oblivion so here's my offer i'll give you the 250 000 it's debt all right i'm gonna charge you nine percent on it for three years and i want the seven percent equity you know he's getting soft [Music] i love you alex barbara i can do 250 000 for 11 you're not interested in debt i take it no i'm not interested in debt if you put in 250 and i put in 250 we get 25 because i would do that and that's more of a bite-sized piece yeah yeah we're each going to put mark and i 250 000 but we want 25 [Applause] i will take that deal congratulations well done thanks and he's a hugger too who knew big-time huggers really delicious thank you guys congrats alex okay congrats congratulations high five i got two amazing sharks that have invested in a lot of food and beverage companies they have a ton of experience and i think they have what it takes to join me and also grow the company how to do that my two cents on this thing go deep don't go national we don't want your advice you didn't invest i hate when you play big shot i'm gonna prove you wrong you ", "SwiftPaws": "next up is an exciting way to keep your best friend active [Music] hi sharks i'm megan this is piper and we're from malabar florida i'm seeking 240 000 for six percent equity in my company swiftpaws if you're

go there and try it well you gotta put a ten dollar bill there then i'll do it it's amazing what you'll do for ten dollars so megan how did you come up with this i learned about this as a sport it's a competitive sport just like dog agility 50 000 entrants in the sports of chasing last year so these sports are growing and people love competing with their dogs for points titles invitationals what are they chasing basically a plastic bag this is our pro grade equipment and this is the straight line competitive sport of fast cat this is our professional grade equipment which is what we call professional grade equipment yes so we started as the american manufacturer of professional grade lure coursing equipment and that is what this sport is called and this is some of our home equipment on a larger field that's great wow so how did you get into this tell us that so i was a recent college grad i got a degree in economics and i took the summer off just to do dog sports i was doing dog agility i discovered the sport of lure coursing what's it called it's called lure coursing with piper actually this got started with a little dog named pretzel and i lost pretzel in may what happened sorry he was 14 and a half i lost him to kidney disease oh so oh he looks like a pretzel it's still hard for me because that dog he was my sidekick he had a great long life he didn't really like to play with toys but he loved chasing stuff is piper your dog too so piper's my dog i got piper a couple of years ago megan take us through the progression absolutely so we got our start making pro grade equipment the equipment out there that people would build when did you start doing this in 2012. i built my first one with the help of my dad my dog loved it i invited my agility friends they loved it i actually how big is the agility sport hundreds of thousands of entries in thousands of competitions every year i built professional grade equipment we filed for our patent and then in about 2017 we were going around the country selling this to zoos dog trainers doggy daycares and then everybody who would come to these events average dog owners would say i need this in my backyard so i couldn't let it go i said i have to make one because the pro grade equipment costs over 2 500 and that's just not affordable so then we launched this with a kickstarter in 2018 we shipped our first units in 2019. so what are sales now so i want to get to sales i don't want to leave you guys hanging so i ended up doing a seed round in 2020. ah and i did that on a convertible note 2.5 million dollar cap i raised 670 000. wow good for you so what percentage do you own now if those notes all converted today i would be at 63 what are the prices of the units so swiftpaw's home retails for 449 dollars for the kit our cost everything into the box is 135. okay meg and now's the money are we ever going to hear this that's the moment you can tell us sales sales we've done 750 000. we're on target to do 1.5 million and we've done 1.5 million lifetime what do you think you'll make on the 1.5 million 140. why so little how much did you lose last year megan so last year we did 425 000 in sales and we lost 380 000. [Music] let me tell you why we actually didn't get back in stock until june and that was because of materials delays early in the year and then we did 425 000 from june to december you lost 385 that means you kept the staff on i kept everybody on in fact i actually increased so january 2020 i hired my first employee that's business karma right there it's admirable you raise 670 you have some sales coming in yes where did the cash go so the rest of the cash was materials so we buy all of our materials we bring them into my hometown we do all of our assembly in my hometown i really think that there are ways to reduce my manufacturing costs for sure 1000 is unfortunately minimum order quantity on some of my parts i don't understand why you're assembling them here when you should be doing it all offshore right i would be open to exploring that here's what i'm here for i want to improve the lives as many dogs as i can look i'm very impressed with what you've built here i think your costs are way out of wax i would be taking this to a factory and completely redesigning the process of manufacturing it i think it's too expensive 449 is a lot for a family even that loves dogs i think you're terrific but this is not for me thank you so i was going to beat you up on the price but i got to tell you you know with your history raising capital keeping your uh employees um you're really the real deal but i don't think that i can help you as much as i would love to for this price so i'm out hey megan i just have one question yes i'm trying to figure out am i interested enough to make an offer i love my dog but 449 dollars is a lot of money do you think if it was 199 is it a 5 million company i think that swift paws is a 100 million dollar company in the next two to three years because this is a 100 billion dollar industry pets and uh i love that you said 199 that's my target price look i think it's a great product what you've been able to accomplish is just you are the american dream you were doing it the exact right way and you love the product so much you just want to spend all day selling it you are the perfect entrepreneur that just needs a little bit of help i just don't know that i'm the right person to help you so for those reasons thank you you still have two sharks left megan megan everything that you have done you made it yourself you did everything you could to make this work and you understand business really you're so impressive and then the product i think is really phenomenal and i think you can sell millions and millions of these yeah one time a year i do something i give away my golden tickets oh lord i do i do i do it once a year to somebody i feel really deserves a dog eats that soup no i you know what you really deserve it and so i am offering you my golden ticket which means that i give you what you came in asking for which is the 240 thousand for six percent oh i was not going to offer you that lori pretzel's paw prints are on the bottom of every unit and i want to continue this journey with you oh yay i'm so glad i love it you deserve it i've been up so many nights there's gonna be so many happy dogs so many happy dogs congrats guys you're all a part of my journey now thank you oh thank you congratulations i can't believe it lori and the golden ticket and i'm so glad that she saw everything that i fought for i know baby all right kevin chase okay go gary wait wait wait okay [Laughter] make it okay faster you ", "GeoOrbital": "[Applause] next into the tank is a modern reinvention of the [Music] wheel hello sharks my name is Michael Berto my name is Dakota Decker our company is GE orbital we're from Cambridge Massachusetts we're seeking $500,000 for 5% of our company sharks we give you the bicycle effectively unchanged for over 100 years now maybe it's just Me Maybe I watch too much science fiction but I want to take the bicycle and introduce it into the 21st century the geoorbital wheel is a step into the future we made a way to turn almost any bicycle Electric in under 60 seconds with no [Music] tools so what you see here is a 100% normal bike exactly as you would buy from a store completely unmodified all you do is take off your regular front wheel put on the G wheel flip on the throttle and you're good to go takes under 60 seconds to install and no tools wow now what you see here is a powerful electric bike the uh motor will take you about 0 to 20 mph in under 10 seconds you can travel up to 20 M on a single charge without even pedaling you're going up a hill no sweat you've got 500 WS of power available at the Press of a lever so can I try it absolutely here let me I got another one for you guys too let me gra the helmet for to know so it's literally exactly like you would ride any bicycle the pedals and brakes work exactly the same the only difference is this some want to try never wear a helmet on television that's just that's a blackmail photo for the rest of your life oh yeah that is very cool oh yeah oh I'm going to catch Kevin is what I'm going to do yeah look at that like riding a bike blind chasing the blind oh my God where's the break you got a pedal wow here we go yeah pleas anybody else want to try it's fun it's like magic are you a Kickstarter in Indiegogo we only launched the company about 4 months ago uh we raised 1.26 million on Kickstarter wow um and after that we've been we've had a little over 200,000 on our website directly through residual media are you shipping or still prototype we're going to be shipping in like 2 months mon first unit I don't think we know the price no we don't do we ever hear the price what is the price it'll retail for $ 950 uh right now 950 for the wheel for the wheel corre isn't it cheaper to buy an electric bike it depends on the bike um you get an electric bike for under $ 950 can you get an electric bike for almost $500 but it's the quality of electric bike that you're getting we haven't seen that a problem with our with our pre-order customers is the market opportunity for this just the bikes that are out there today that don't have electric yet we feel it's there's a hurdle to biking for people if I get anxious if I get on a bike regular bike I'll get tired I'm anxious about going up hills I'll anxious about getting sweating on my way to work right you don't have to sell us on the promise of electric bikes I own a couple of them we're going in a direction where all bikes that are shipped ultimately are going to have an electric option in them would you ever make a bike that's what I'm trying to ask you uh I want to I want to show you something real fast we we don't make any bikes currently we made something different that is a cool bike I love the banana see what do you got this is how it works you just sit on it and it's the same thing it looks looks I love that bike it's very tight turning nice tight turning there is nothing you cannot do anything like this with any other technology so this is also something we sell and this is a full electric bike it's extremely Nimble it's extremely small you put it on the trunk of your car you say you're selling them for $950 this is $200 in addition to the win where are you prioritizing your time on the new bike or that wheel oh the bike was a side note the bike is for fun to be honest that was the opposite of the answer I wanted to hear this is gonna be as fast as uh last season's Dallas Mavericks playoff highlight reel I believe that can I just say that highlight real you oh wait you don't have a team you don't have any highlights of anything do you oh my god that's literally your only comeback my God that I on a basketball team oh that was a Zinger I I believe in the space electric bikes are here to stay there's no doubt about it it I just really like to invest in the thing that's forward looking not the thing that's retrofitted to the existing technology if you had told me you were moving on this bike that I think as goofy as it looks right now is really Innovative that would have got me more excited I think there's a good short-term opportunity in retrofitting existing bikes but I want to be betting on the longterm electric native bikes so for that reason I'm out retrofitting current to make it future is the future we're making electric vehicles out of stuff that's collecting dust in your basement this is the future one of the biggest challenges having been in multiple bike companies is sales and distribution right inevitably there's an initial jump online you know you get that initial surge that you're going through right now but it's just such a competitive environment it is just so hard to compete to sell bikes against the big box retailers the small shops and all the different Alternatives it's just not a business I want to be in so for those Reasons I'm out thank you but let me also add as far as how we grow right so we're director consumer now uh in the next two years we want to do a lot more Fleet delivery services police so does everybody so does everybody every motorized vehicle but we they don't need new bikes it's kind of it's a good point police have their current bikes bike shares have their current bikes $950 a unit even significantly discounted that's going to be a big hurdle to overcome to me there's three rules to a great product is it something that people need and want is it something that solves a problem which clearly it does can it be made at an affordable price you have number one you have number two right now you don't have number three and for that reason sadly I'm out I live in the Back Bay in Boston in a tiny Brownstone with a tiny elevator and that bike the little one fits in it great I'm come over and buy one but I think you need another couple of iterations to get the cost down I think it has to go below 300 guys I'm a buyer of the small bike but not the company I'm out okay you still have one shark left I'm so intrigued by this little bike I even named it already I'd call it the bug the bug it just looks like a bug to me you know um I think it's going to be hard to sell this I think the price is too high I'll probably just buy myself an electric bike cuz I can't picture myself swapping and I think I'm not going to be alone in that regard so I'm going to join Kevin and buy one too but I'm [Music] out thank you thank you guys appreciate thank you guys good luck with [Music] everything although we didn't strike a deal with the sharks today it's definitely not the end for Geor we're just getting roll that's right ", "Flasky Flowers": "[Applause] next to the tank is a way to have fun but keep it classy same suit i wore at my wedding hi sharks this is my husband ryan moynihan and this is my wife kelly moynihan we are from delray beach florida today we are seeking 50 000 in exchange for 10 equity in our company sharks we have made saying i do a lot more fun what if i told you i had a margarita in my hand or two glasses of wine would you believe me so many brides hide their drink behind someone else's back for pictures but now the bride and her entire tribe can sip in true wedding style [Laughter] that's what's up right there our company is called flasky flowers and it's exactly as it sounds a flask within its flowers so now when a bride or a groom is walking down the aisle they can hold a beautiful bouquet with a 12-ounce beverage of their choice in the palm of their hand literally in the palm of their hand and it's simple you pick it they can be genuine they can be artificial heck it could be lollipops you snip it to the size that works best for you you stick it anywhere you want because you really can't mess it up fill it obviously with the drink of your choice you snap it oh my god and you sip it to stay hydrated all day long sharks the real question who wants to raise their flasks with us yeah baby i do oh my god so cute where's the straw wow keep spinning you just put it in your mouth okay i have to understand the genesis of this story so i'm a hairdresser by trade and i was doing a lot of weddings and i watched all the girls getting ready doing their hair and drinking and then out the door with their flowers in their hand and that was my moment i came home and i said to ryan we've i've got something we've got to do and i made a prototype that night and i used my babies formula bottle a plastic martini glass hey lee and ryan all right so kelly show us that anybody that says america is not the greatest country in the world with the most creative entrepreneurs kelly tell me let me see the product by itself so that we know under the flowers what's happening where does the wine or the alcohol go or the water it goes underneath and it's completely sectioned off yes so the flowers are not touching your drink at all no are you selling any of these our sales are twenty one thousand dollars and how long have you been selling them and what do they sell for twenty dollars they cost me a dollar seventy seven to make yeah and do you make them in the usa or where they're 100 made in the usa that's very kelly how do you sell them is it all online just online so how much did it cost you to make the mold and the tooling what did you have to invest in this so we actually sold our house he could get the money he quit his job so double wall take care of the kids and i could focus on this and make it a reality um i put in sixty thousand dollars triple whoa and how many kids do you have we have seven one seven oh my gosh god no wonder so let me understand this so you come up with the idea you sell your house you both quit your jobs you're all in you have 60k into it you've sold how much to date 21 000. 21 000 what are you living off of well i do hair we took off in 2019 and it was awesome and then i was pregnant with baby number seven and we didn't know but when she came out she needed open-heart surgery so it took the wind out of my sails but i said to him january 2020 i'm signing up for shows we're getting back into it and then coveted and as we know the biggest yeah the wedding industry went nowhere yeah and it just we're in a place right now where with the seven kids we are skating by what made you risk so much with seven children to feed you quitting your job for this idea why would you risk so much risk because i know it's possible i know i know if i keep moving forward with this um there's a finish line and i'm gonna get to it and if it's a million dollar idea it's gonna buy me a two-car garage it's gonna pay for my kids if you keep on moving you can't fall over right how much inventory do you have right now 1500. in today's world you can't just go the extra mile you have to go the extra marathon so like that's what you did you took a shot you took a chance you got in here um i think it's funny novel fun i think people will love it so i'm gonna give you an offer oh okay i will give you the 50 000 for 20 okay but wait there's more mark and i having already done deals like this with crazy chicken ideas and having made money have decided to go together all right so you get two sharks instead of just one oh and they tailor-made for this business yeah well i'm in the wedding business there's no way we can even get lori to come in with us [Music] i'd love to put laurie into this mix but we we need at least each 10 you got to realize that but we you know if it's going to be 25 25 right so we can put in another 25 to get it to 30. right so 75 grand that we'll invest for 30 of the company we realize since you're seven and you've got a full-time job you both have full-time jobs this is going to be my full-time job yeah well but we need to help you get to that point first right before you can quit what you're doing because you're not in a position to quit day one so for the three of us in there 25 grand each for 30 percent we we give you more money than you asked for we just get 10 you got three sharks on a very crazy chicken idea may i make you a stand-alone offer i can't believe this is getting multiple offers for only five percent of the business but i want to choose two of your children to take and i'll home you that same offer you know what you've got seven you're not going to miss them yeah i will i will go on a serious note i'm not going to make an order but you have great offers here i'm out yeah okay well thank you thank you so what do you think it doesn't get better than this no it doesn't it doesn't it really doesn't they couldn't ask for anything more than that i think it's amazing and i think we are so excited and a hundred percent yes to all three of you yeah my goodness i can't believe it congratulations thank you i would have thought the chance of this happening were zero oh my gosh oh my god thank you guys thank you yes yes yes that's just [Applause] you ", "Man-Pack": "next up is an entrepreneur with a better version of the Modern Man bag [Music] hi my name is Aaron Tweedy and I'm from Front Royal Virginia I'm here today seeking two hundred thousand dollars for a 29 stake in my company manpak the manpak is a sling styled vertical messenger bag designed by guys four guys you know 40 years ago men carried nothing more than a money clip but times have changed on average guys now carry 4.5 pounds of stuff things like Keys cell phones tablets energy drinks point is guys need to carry stuff and we have very few options we have the backpack the briefcase the traditional messenger bag and I'm sure all of you remember the fanny pack I have designed a superior product that I call Urban tactical you can wear this thing three different ways first waist bandolier style if you need to take it off quickly it has a quick release clasp a chest mounted utility pocket for your cell phone with a magnetic button closure line it up locks itself shut three rows them only for tactical gear and a collapsible beverage holder when you need it it's there when you don't no no collapsible beverage holder it folds up and out of the way to get into it you don't need to take it off just spin it around and open it up plus you have auxiliary pockets for things like your wallet loose Pocket Change Keys now if you're someplace we're going to take it on and off frequently you can throw it over one shoulder notice how the weight still hangs over your lower back due to the ergonomic design of the strap and if you're in the city on the Metro you can wear it reverse keep your possessions in front of you and safe from pickpockets the mission statement a manpak is to make men more prepared because a prepared man is a better man with your support we can turn the man bag Market into the man pack Market thank you for the opportunity to present and I'd be happy to answer any questions Aaron what's your background are you located baby that was really good are you what's your background are you a designer uh no I built my first house when I was 19 and uh I was in Fort Benning Georgia when I was 17. were you in the Army I was you know when you first walked in I looked at it and I thought oh another knapsack for guys whatever but you definitely wowed me with the utility of it can we see him can you head can we take a look sure yes thank you here you got me the black one thanks all right you get the XL yeah yeah he needs the XL thank you sir appreciate it have you sold any of these I have what are your sales what are your sales okay so last year 76 000 this year we're at 65 000 year to date is that online what do you think you're gonna do this year 145. what do you sell them for 59.95 and what are you making for them for they cost right now 22 dollars and five cents a piece so this product requires an explanation because it's hard to differentiate it against anything else that's true you have to educate the consumer because this is an emerging market bags are Emerging Market this is the millennial version of the merse but it's not great it's not a purse it's not a backpack but Aaron here's the concern when I was in Europe last summer with my family right I had a similar bag and I wasn't ashamed to wear it in public because every other guy in Europe had one exactly when I came back here I put the same thing on I didn't make it one block down the street everybody was laughing at me you know but that's not immersed Robert I don't think they were laughing at you for that you know a couple of things one um it's not immerse when you see the guys that I sell to the Secret Service agents and military personnel and law enforcement Personnel I never laugh at somebody with a gun right exactly well let's go to the real numbers how many did you sell last month online only probably like 40. you know I mean it's not good but I started this with five thousand dollars I've been doing a lot with next to nothing why do you think the company's worth seven hundred thousand dollars okay um 50 000 for the design pattern which but what did you get the design patent for for this model like what a bag with a strap that has so many pockets it's just the lookout what else are you adding to the value a multiple of sales for two years being the 145 000 projection 18 000 intellectual property that being the bank of uh YouTube commercials that I've created they're really funny you're putting a hard value on those value is a matter of perception and if we're on yes it is we're on an island and you have a bar of gold and I have a cheeseburger who's rich I'll take the gold okay instead of getting the plate and leave the island let's go Robert hold on wait are we done oh we don't want all the numbers oh just no um okay and 200 000 in Goodwill and 200 000 in Goodwill if I gave you 200 000 I'd have to own about uh 260 of the company a lot about that you have very small sales that's the reason I'm out I'm just a disciplined Financial investor I understand yeah I kind of agree with Kevin I think this this is a hard business to invest in I think you're a hustler and you're a great salesperson I just think it's hard for you to scale which makes it hard to invest in and so for those Reasons I'm out I'm out we've seen many people with um good sales bad sales and then we normally bet on the person and thank you for serving our country thank you we also look for small indications on how good this partner would be your I'm gonna charge twenty thousand dollars for the your videos that you may have made at home it indicated that you don't have a sense of financial intelligence when it comes to what Partners need and operating this business and for that reason I'm out I have to tell you as impressed as I am with you to me it looks like a messenger bag so you've got to go and you've got to run real fast baby you got to get out there but that's a journey for you and you're a tough guy ex-military I think you're going to do it I just you're not going to do it in the time frame but I want to do it in for that reason I'm out I don't know that much about what men carry around but I do know that in all my years in retail and at QVC and creating products the hardest thing is when there's just a ton of competition and you're not even sure how popular the market is for it and we're not sure how many people are going to be buying the product and for that reason I'm up [Music] I wish you all the best though all right well thank you guys very much what it comes down to is that they didn't like my valuation I'm sure they would have liked to have 70 percent of the business for 20 grand and you know I look forward into the future and I know that it's going to be worth a lot more because I'm going to make it worth a lot more ", "KUDO BANZ": "next into the tank is

i came home one day from work and amanda said i had a moment with my kyle he came home and told me that i'm not a good listener and she was like you know i think it's our parenting you know all these timeouts and negative he's drawing attention to that negative focus then she said you know what i'm going to make a product that's going to help other moms and dads across america and the world we did a soft launch mid-year in 2017 to really learn our market and the new category we were creating our big debut was at the 2018 new york toy fair we where we met a lot of retailers so far our sales are 80 000 micaiah where do you go to college 80 000 in sales is not a business yet so let's talk about the strategy for distribution we actually are selling it all across the us but you're doing it online right we're doing it online on our website we're in amazon what do you sell it to them for what does it cost you to make it yeah the starter kit comes at 29.95 which includes the hardcover storybook right we're talking to bye bye-bye baby we met them at the new york toy fair so yeah we've got a great plan and it's not a hobby we're all in on this business absolutely um i actually resigned from my hedge fund job about two years ago to jump into entrepreneurship amanda grew a firm she's a successful entrepreneur with 20 investment and took it all the way to a million dollar another company 20 investors and we have one of the most successful companies on etsy we are the top go ahead you can tell us your favorites of the 1 of the 30 in the entire etsy wow i think you've achieved the most important thing in life which has raised a wonderful family i understand rewards and token systems i know how many there are out there yeah and i'm just not comfortable that it's differentiated enough to be a big business so for that reason i'm out thank you appreciate your time we understand thanks i'm currently working on a book that i feel might be a conflict of interest we're sorry for now though i'm sorry i'm out and i i had a company that i invested in in season two pro flip outs and the company was creating bands uh for not roughing the same thing but it's very hard to have longevity in the in the kids wanting to wear the bands it kind of wears out after a while so with that i'm out thank you dana the fact that you have all these awards is tempting but you're not worth a million and a half dollars nobody beats you up about valuation and kids this is important i'm gonna take a kudos from you yeah that's all right 150 for 10 is a 1.5 million valuation that's a lot of money for something that isn't making any money yet our margins are huge though we make the starter kit and potty kit from 498 and we sell it for 29.95 here's your problem with 80 000 in sales you want a valuation a million five there's no investor gonna do that until there's more proof of concept and you're gonna have to give up some inordinate percentage of your company to just get the 150 our evaluation is fair it is fair i love this kid he's got you speechless he's stumped you can't he can't it's very hard for me our assets are very good we have ip patents keep going we need patents i love this kid i love it you want to take my chair i can give you some reasons why it's not kevin all he's missing is a big snout he's a little you look i i just think it's too early i can't go down the path with you i'm out thank you kevin for your time guys congratulations on what you accomplished the challenge i'm having is not whether you'll be successful right you guys are going to grind it out no matter what but sometimes that road can be difficult but we're ready for it we are ready for this market but i'm going to tell you guys more power pack team than us sometimes you got to listen you've clearly never met my favorite i have no doubt they're amazing you're amazing but part of being a great entrepreneur is listening okay you've got some immediate challenges and you haven't really had the sell-through this is what kevin was referring to i don't think you're quite there you have some adjustments to make so for those reasons i'm out but congratulations on what you've accomplished guys thank you very much i really like the way that you stood up for yourself you're doing better than most of the adults to pitch here because you're gonna be a future shark so congratulations amazing thank you thank you thank you guys all right thank you appreciate it thank you for the time we're going to take this negative and turn it into a giant positive in a way it's a gift that they gave us because now we're out there to prove ourselves and better believe it that this team right here is going to do that i'm so proud of you guys you know i'm so proud of these kids right here i'm so proud of you yeah we took on the tank and you know they're gonna they're gonna regret this they're definitely gonna regret this [Music] [Applause] [Music] first into the tank is a

sarah hi sarah i'm his mom carrie and we're from san clemente california i'm seeking sixty thousand dollars for fifteen percent of my company you just saw my first invention it's called street tubes it lets rice surf anywhere anytime because it looks and feels like you're totally getting tubed my second invention was when i first started middle school and it was the first time i ever had a locker my locker was decked out and awesome but none of my skateboards would fit in it so i decided what the heck why not just make one my own this is a locker board locker boards are handmade and reshaped from recycled skateboard decks at only 16 inches long they fit easily inside of backpacks and lockers and they're good for the planet thanks mom let's pass out some samples rob we're getting on the board i gotta get on the board thank you great thank you oh carson love the hair thank you very cool thank you sharks bye bye good job tiara bye cece great job oh that's cool sharks the benefit of you investing in my company is that you'll be a part of something that's been inspiring people all over the world i've been surfing with sharks since i was five years old so go ahead hit me with some questions all right normally a skateboard's this big is it or uh yes is this the first time anyone's ever cut it down to size it's the only skateboard that fits inside a backpack but i've seen small ones before what's unique about it uh they're good for the planet easy to take anywhere and they're super fun to ride and also the square shape lets you still do tricks because of the corners and your feet can stay on it and it won't be too wobbly where are you getting the old boards from uh van skateboards has a monthly recycling program for me at two of their skate parks and i get about 50 boards a month from them and they give them to you or right now you're buying them uh give them to me are you selling any today for nine months i have been selling all over the country how are you selling it across the country online social media really he's made ten thousand dollars in revenue since uh he started so sierra your girlfriend [Music] [Applause] wow what will you do with the money if somebody puts it up manufacturing upgrading my website buying uh tricks and wheels hardware in bulk how many skateboards have you sold i have sold 231 what does it cost you to make one so the deck cost me three dollars but now vance put me in touch with their manufacturer madrid skateboards so that costs 13 and i'm now selling them for 52 wholesale wow wholesale wholesale retail what's the price um 99 where do you make it now my husband set up a shop for him and he's been making them in the backyard i mean i remember when i started in business my headmaster called me into the study and said look you either leave school and you run your business or you stay at school and you don't run your business i was 15 i said okay i'm off i dropped out of high school when i was 16. so i waited an extra year did you really drop out of school yeah yeah i was a high school dropout did you go to college yeah i was 16 dropped out of high school started taking graduate level classes and got my mba by the time i was 19 transferred those back to high school so i could graduate from high school i'm curious richard what was your first business the first sort of um was to start a magazine to campaign against the vietnamese war that was going on so it became a national magazine for young people and that was my education but look this is great but you're going to stay at school so you're going to have to learn to delegate because too many people think they can do it all themselves so carson you said that you had gotten some help to make these because you can't make them anymore what's your deal with them uh madrid skateboards and they are manufacturing my boards doing everything and then i just put the trucks and wheels on how do i know there's in a carson in new jersey doing the same thing the main reason skaters buy product is from brand loyalty when they so when they go to buy a locker board they're gonna want a locker board not some fake two they're really hard to make you have to have all the right equipment all the right hardware and three i'm in patent pending status you kill it drop that fight [Applause] listen you're amazing but i'm not going to invest in the company i'm out thank you carson where do you want to be a year from now two years from now five years from now i want to be everywhere that's a lot of places um sounds like one of us what's what's been amazing online is great because he has much higher profit margins but he'd also like to be retailers because it does give him a lot of credibility right now he's in a southern california retailer jack surfboards he's in two of their stores you know here's what i think you know i would not invest in your company now because i think that you have so much growth and giving up 15 or 20 percent of your company right now is absolutely absurd you have a lot of room to grow and i think you'll do it without us so i'm out okay carson i love what you're doing i want to make you an offer okay i'll give you the sixty thousand dollars but i want twenty percent and my plan is not just to help you manufacture because you have madrid to do that that part's all taken care of but to really help you build up your youtube help you build up your instagram so if you want to be my partner i'm happy to make the investment wow what do you say before he answers i i was going to suggest that i was going to suggest that i was going to suggest that you and i worked together on it nope no no no right so what do you think you and i work together oh i know if he's not going to work with me i'll make you an offer i'll offer you 65 000 for 20 percent for twenty percent so carson i love things that are cool and fun i really don't think you should sell any of your business at this point because it's just too soon i don't want any of the equity what i'll do is i'll give you the sixty thousand dollars as a loan what interest rate robert whatever okay eight percent give or take right i'm offering sixty thousand dollars for twenty percent and sir richard branson is offering five thousand dollars for twenty percent and what would you like to do uh richard if you're gonna invest uh how would you help my company oh you're gonna interview i like it you've got guts wow when you said you wanted to do everything i remember i had this magazine and somebody wanted to buy it went to lunch to sell the sell the company so i said i'm going to start student airlines i'm going to start um you know student record shots student this they got completely panicked and so when you said you wanted to do everything i remembered that moment when i wanted to do everything let me be honest i see a young richard branson in youtube you've got a wonderful story to tell you're very articulate the product itself is great we'd love you to give it a shot with us [Music] it's a deal all right great thank you thank you so much thank you great thank you good job good job carson good job thank you so much yes you know wanting to do everything that really hits home i think with all of us it's contradictory to of course what everyone's taught i mean think about when we started the show nine years ago that's the biggest changes that go around the country yeah half the people that come up to me are kids yeah i chose richard branson because he would help me the most internationally internationally yeah and uh also he had the highest offer and i felt like make a little bit more oh my goodness i can't believe that i'm doing this trick with social anxiety about to go talk to a couple of billionaire millionaires [Music] [Applause] first in the tank is a stylish and functional accessory [Music] hi i'm sophie overton i'm from bentonville arkansas and i'm seeking 30 thousand dollars for 15 equity in my company sharks i'm 13 years old and even though i'm still in the 8th grade i have a phd in psychology heck i know more about thread counts than i do about the periodic table i created a sock for kids made by this kid to make life easier for whatever we're doing introducing wise pocket products an innovative line of socks and leggings with pockets in them big enough for kids most important items like your phone so you don't have to worry about the life-threatening event of missing a call or text from your mom anymore and i know what you're probably thinking there's got to be tons of socks like this well i created a patent-pending sock design for kids to safely stick their important items into our sock pockets so if you're playing soccer rock climbing or you know spontaneously breaking out to dance with your friends wise pocket products has you covered [Music] whoa nice [Music] i just want to let you guys know you're all going to have arthritis when you get old so as you can see sharks even after all that our design sock pockets will keep your important items in without falling out and the best part is for every pair of socks that we sell we donate a pair of socks to kids in need sharks i know i'm young but give me five years and i hope i'll be sitting in one of those chairs so tell me who's wise enough to join me in getting wise pocket products to kids everywhere thank you for letting me tell you about wives and thanks guys all right good job great guys excellent excellent excellent you're going to show us some sophie in person here yeah sure here you go you can take three thank you [Music] you did great thank you thank you thank you nice colors though huh thanks sophie thank you tell us about you how you got into this business well i got into this business when i was 11 and my cousin her phone and her boot because you know kids and women's clothing don't have pockets so i tried it too and it was really uncomfortable because it slipped down to my ankle and i couldn't reach it and it was just all in all a bad idea and so i asked around my school to see if other kids had this problem and they did and so i came up with my prototype where i cut off the top of another sock and stuck it inside the sock that's cool and i sewed it up the sides and voila how did you get your money for the business i save everything that i earn and i how much money did you actually put in to make your socks i invested ten thousand of my own ten thousand wow ten thousand i think your parents overpaid you for your job no uh i had saved five thousand and i earned five thousand more through business pitches and competitions nice oh wow wow good for you have you been watching shark tank very long since i was like six years old make us feel old you know i'd stand up in the living room and say i'm gonna be on shark tank this has been my goal since before i even had the idea for the business have you sold any of these yet yes how much a little under 16 000 in sales sophie let me just tell you you're a perfect example of what every kid-preneur should do right you've got a job you saved up some money you did all the prototypes yourself then you made actual products then you sold those products 16 000 worth of products now the only question is did you sell those products profitably tell us what it cost you to make a sock and what you're selling them for to make the sock it's 5.47 because that's expensive yes it's because of the process to make the double welt for my pocket what do you sell them for 15 retail and 11 wholesale what do you want with the 30 000 sofia what are you gonna do with it well my main goal is to streamline the production because uh right now i'm only able to produce around 100 units per month because i have a month uh yes that's horrible so there's other things out there on the market that hold in socks they have pockets right i do have competition although my competitors only have like small pockets for keys and stuff well sophie look i love what you're doing and it's wonderful to see this at such a young age but i don't want a saw company in my portfolio so i'm out thank you sophie i think it's a great idea i'm gonna get some for my kids um for me though it's not a great fit as an investment simply because this isn't my strength i couldn't tell you about thread counts you know um but i mean congratulations you should be so proud but it's not a fit for me so for those reasons i'm out thank you very much congrats though sophie do you feel that you want to be running a business right now or is it a little stressful when you're going to school and all of that i mean going into high school is stressful on its own but with the wise pocket product it's kind of a boost for me i feel a confidence boost like if i can own a business then i can go through school and turn in that essay good thank you sophie thank you you're already out there hustling thinking creating doing it yourself so you've got everything that it takes to really be a great entrepreneur and damon and i want to help you he does quite a bit in the soccer arena and he would like to do an offer with me i started off with bombers they were doing 800 000 and they were donating to people and they've donated over 10 million pairs of socks they're doing 120 million now and the donation is way more important to them than the money yeah so what do you think lori we'll do the 30 000 we'll be a third partner our goal is to try to find somebody to license it and then when we get to that point we'll figure out what the licensing deal is do you want to take the 30 000 and give up one-third of your company you got to make a decision yes or no you are right mr wonderful it's a lot of my company i'd like to make a counteroffer yeah sophie okay let's share it um 35 000 for 25 wow wow somebody's got negotiating skills so you're going you got a little switchblade in her sock on that one 25 percent [Music] we will take that offer thank you so much we're in the sock business again yes high five thank you thank you so much proud of you i'm so impressed by you wow congratulations sophie well done thank you [Music] i'm very overwhelmed and i'm really excited that i got a deal with lauren damond and i'm just i'm in heaven i mean i'm so excited you ", "UMARO": "[Applause] first in the tank is a healthy alternative to a food that many vegans miss the most [Music] hello sharks i'm beth zodder and i'm amanda stiles we're from berkeley california and we're the co-founders of the umaro protein company the plant-based meat category is exploding but everyone's using the same proteins it's time for a sea change and we're building something that can change everything this is umaro seaweed that's been transformed from plant to protein seaweed is surprisingly high in protein and it's one of the fastest growing plants on earth seaweed requires no land no fresh water and no fertilizer to grow it's a super food for the planet we are pioneers at the forefront of a new frontier in protein we're developing advanced systems in high-tech ocean farming and precision protein extraction that will unlock the ocean as our future source of protein it's massive but none of that really matters unless it tastes good yep so we're using it to create america's favorite food it's the holy grail of plant-based meat sizzly salty delicious yes bacon is the first plant-based bacon your dad is gonna like there's two kinds of bacon lovers in this world the ones who like it crispy and the ones who like it soft and chewy either way you like it we've made bacon that's just like the real thing and will blow your mind bacon is huge but it's just the beginning we're asking for five hundred thousand dollars in exchange for two percent equity in the future who's ready to bring home the bacon gotta try it this better tastes good so what you have in front of you is a classic american sandwich blt blt is made with extra crispy bacon but for those of you who like it soft to chewy our bacon is pre-cooked on your left you have the bacon right out of the package and in the middle is just right the crispy's okay the chewy not so much oh it's not which one's this the chewy one that's right out of the box most people are gonna like the crispy bacon i love bacon don't love this christmas it doesn't really taste like bacon no the crispy one does i mean it's salted right you've got that cured taste just trying a sandwich it's great in a sandwich like really good i think in a sandwich it's pretty nice so you're 87 calories for two strips so compared to real bacon how many calories in a strip of real bacon it's very similar so we have we have a similar amount of fat a little bit lower protein but what we're going for here is to get the the juicy fatty texture of bacon what's your background where did you get like how did you come up with it so first of all let me tell you my mission is to protect this amazing planet that we live on my background is in renewable energy and a few years ago i received a 5 million research grant from the department of energy to build and engineer offshore seaweed farms for fuel i knew that animal protein was a huge contributor to global warming and i realized that seaweed had an immense potential to be a planet-friendly source of protein and how did you two find each other we're actually from the same county in virginia but we didn't meet until we were in berkeley and i went looking for someone who was an expert in protein first off my mission is to reduce the factory farming of animals and i think the best way to do that is by making plant-based foods that are so delicious people would rather eat them than the animals so i earned a phd in plant biochemistry to give me the expertise to make top of the line plant-based food how many other competitors do you have we're the first and only company to commercialize seaweed protein and we have foundational intellectual property across the value chain we have patent applications on the protein separation process we have patent applications on using our protein in plant-based meats and we have a patent application on the fat mimetic that we've made so you're not selling this product yet this is a prototype it's what you have in front of you is the first 500 slices ever made what does this cost to make and what do you sell it for right so we'll be launching in food service food service will pay 18 a pound for comparison a food service currently pays about 15 a pound for real pre-cooked bacon okay we'll get we'll get uh 12.60 from the distributor and right now our cost of goods is about 7.30 we'll bring that down to 5.20 other people are going to have access to seaweed right right and there's others that are working on an alternative process that is similar to yours you just think your efficiency of the protein is better our patent applications cover the use of seaweed protein in plant-based meat you said bacon was just the beginning so what else are you planning so we're really excited to keep moving in the breakfast meat category and also in other cured meats i'm really excited to make pepperoni you want to reinvent the whale and make it from scratch you want to make a sausage they want to replace the industries yeah you want to do all that stuff we're going to be one of the giants in this industry in the next decade where you're losing me is you're saying the business today is worth 25 million dollars and you're not capturing for me how you're going to get that market if i'm a consumer and i walk into a store and i see a soy based product and i see your product why would i pick up your product no one is going to make anything close to as good as what is our bacon basically qualitative you'll buy them from my heart because it tastes like bacon i don't know if it tastes just like bacon though it's a prototype we're going to keep improving it this is our first batch but with our first batch we've already gotten a purchase order we're in conversations with two additional restaurant chains i can't cross the bridge to the 25 million dollars for a 2 investment based on our bacon tastes better i'm out we're at the early stages of a revolution in plant-based food the companies that establish the leading products in each category right now will be giants in the next decade and we will be one of them in order to do this you're going to have to raise a boatload of money we're currently in the middle of a series a fundraiser what valuation 25 million you two are two of the most impressive women i've ever seen the thing that gets me is the valuation at this point five hundred thousand for two percent of your business just feels a little punchy you are going to need to raise a boatload of money and so i'm going to end up getting diluted and diluted and diluted down so for that reason i'm out but good luck thank you i will make you an offer i'm not agreeing on your valuation i understand this may cause some heartache with this a-round you're doing but i also bring a lot of value in who i am and what i can do i'll do this deal for the 500k um i'd like eight percent all right thank you i'd like to hear how much you raising in this round we're raising 10 million do you have any flexibility on the equity you're willing to give up more for the 500 000 borrow equity for 500 000 yeah would you consider his 8 uh we'd do 8 for 1 million i'll do that deal listen ladies wait listen listen listen look at me you are badass women i love badass women you blow me away you're so impressive i want to be on this journey with you really really really badly i would like five hundred thousand for four percent but i want to be non-dilutive through the next round so guys my office still is there at 100 a million dollars rather for eight percent and obviously i have the history and plant-based foods and i already have companies that i can connect you with that are my companies i would love to have both of you would you consider going in together i will tell you this i have some major corporations behind me that want to help me with women in tech and women just like yourselves and they are big presence um everybody's got so listen we all have something but you just have to see who do you want along with you for the journey i'm gonna be in it with my heart and soul in it to win it three bad ass women mark would you go to seven percent yeah cuban you have a deal all right bummer thank you congrats good luck you guys thank you mark is a leader in the plant-based space he's invested a number of other companies and so we're really glad to have them on board seaweed is the most planet-friendly source of protein around and our bacon is going to be the first of many products that get seaweed onto the plates of every american and everyone in the world i would have liked to been along for the journey but you out monied me damn it happened mark the richie man you ", "Fort": "next up is a product to Aid a favorite childhood activity hi hi my name is Connor Lewis from St Louis Missouri and I am the founder of Fort I am seeking $500,000 for 10% of my company wow so sharks my story goes something like this my daughter and I were building pillow forts in our living room and I found myself going don't take that beige couch cushion that's mom's favorite blanket nothing dining room chairs and spending all that time cleaning up the mess after she went to bed it hit me there's got to be a better way to do this right and that is where the idea of Fort came from storable stackable wipable completely modular system to build the ultimate pillow fort but get this it's all held together by magnets oo and as I like to say yay SCI so the best part about building a pillow fort is this part which is diving on it diving on it absolutely so shks who wants to save the couch cisti of the world and build the ultimate pillow for it with me good job I think you win the points for the world's best dad that's for sure but like what is your background how did you come up with so um I was working in marketing and unfortunately I lost my job during Co in April ail last year and I was wondering like what am I going to do with my life um I had always wanted to be an entrepreneur but there was just this like huge fear that I wouldn't be able to take care of everybody and my wife has a really good corporate job she's a CPA and I had just enough money from Severance I sold my car and I had this idea for a magnetic pillow for it so Connor how are you selling this product we were completely focused on direct to Consumer I ended up taking a business partner who owns 5% of the company right now he has put in all the operational Equity he has the opport to buy in up to 40% based on wow what triggers that uh Revenue targets but hold on let me get to the price so the price right now currently is $4.99 for this full set right here you see on the far right um it comes with 12 pie9 five cush five cushions yes and $1 124 magnets $500 a lot of money that was one of the biggest challenges we had early on so we launched on Kick absolutely is you're absolutely right so we launched on Kickstarter in j 2021 my claim to fame is I sold $2 million of products in 10 hours yeah $2 million in 10 hours ended up doing 3.1 for the whole campaign we've done 4.5 uh today yourday it was at that price at $4.99 no our average purchase price was $269 have you delivered on the kickstarter we're delivering right now I I have about 400 units going out today let me talk about the cogs for a little bit so um when we launched like I mentioned the the average price was shipping included was around 2269 my original cogs were around right at $200 landed and then added a $50 shipping charge this strategy was first of all I wanted to be able to see if I could actually sell this right I knew it would be more expensive than the competitors the magnets alone cost $60 a unit right hug why aren't you using velcro like everybody else because I we ran a lot of surveys and parents un unanimously hate Velcro so what we did was we sold at a loss for the first day um and at 269 yeah with shipping include parents really let finish let finish tell us your thought process here yeah what I realized was that shipping obviously International Freight not only that but of course this product is hug to ship when I realized how high volume I was selling I ended up selling almost 13,000 units at Kickstarter you know it's unbelievable right you do like $2 million the numbers are rolling all day right and I let codependency set the price and set what the customer wanted after I realized I oversold the first day I was like oh I have to work really hard to sell the rest of this campaign and I didn't sell enough important is is the people out there that joined into your Kickstarter right they were excited to get the product you let them dictate the price but then you had to go back to the factories you had to figure out the shipping and you had to say oh my God how do I do this for 269 yeah we realized we were in the hole we didn't know how big the hole was so we started selling at a high price point we sold qu million dollars in another 24 hours right and this is in May a few after what price $4.99 so so doubling the price actually didn't hurt you you're saying no we've been able to and we've continued selling now we're selling a product that no one has gotten yet we're currently shipping out our Kickstarter I have 177,000 units coming from overseas right now and no one has received the product so it's never shipped in yet listen I have a couple of big concerns here number one is that you don't know if this is going to work right you've got an enormous amount of orders sitting there nobody has the product yet you don't know what the customer feed if people love it what your returns are going to be I mean that is a huge concern right now right the good news is you have their money first I I do and so this is where we get to like the international Freight challenge the last 30 days we've had all we've had great suppliers I have an incredible 3pl I'm working with who've all like totally gone to B for us and I've found myself like staring at the numbers and being like oh this is this is bad thing I'm assuming you've burnt a lot of cash yeah incred all basically all of it all of it you're selling yourself out of business it could be put that way certainly I mean it's a really tough situation right it is aough Jo Ian yeah but this is super hard I mean like yesterday my wife literally like sat on the steps in our house and cried because like this is hard you all have done this super hard you're going to figure things out like you're that person who's not going to crumble you're going to figure it out but at least you're being really honest with us about what's happened I want to understand a little bit more about your partner you mentioned you brought a partner in for 5% and more importantly what triggers the 40% he will get 40% if he and his team are helping us get to $30 million in Revenue gross Reven gross sales yes what is it that he's technically doing so he has the relationship with his supplier that he's done tens of millions of dollars with so he works with the factory yep he has full marketing team ad buyers and we both agree that this hold that I have sunk us into we can be overcome in the next few months let me take a stab at this all right I see a whole bunch of problems I'm sorry I mean first of all your cost of goods are way too high I don't understand why in the world you'd spend $60 on magnets when velcro's just fine I don't buy the story the parents can't deal with velcro giving away 40% to somebody for no cash which is your number one problem makes absolutely no sense to me I'm sorry Connor I'm out Fair con you're a a great case for what not to do as an entrepreneur right people can learn a lot from your experience and look I think you can survive this it's not bad that you work with somebody else who didn't provide cash right because expertise cost you one way or another so getting their expertise is fine but the trigger for their 40% being set to sales means that if any one of us invest the minute we close the deal and we help you get to 30 million we're diluted by 40% immediately so for those reasons amount thanks Mark I appreciate it Conor you know this is just not a proven business yet you've got all the sales but you might have a 50% return rate and we just don't know that yet it's just not an investable opportunity for me so I'm out I appreciate that yeah so I mean it's obviously a really challenging situation at least you're honest about it you know I have to be right I can't have to be I mean you're such a good person I can tell I would have been in on you in a heartbeat instantly but now you've you found someone else it seems that's trying to get you out of the hole so I think you have a partner in there right now that's doing a lot of the things that I would have tried to do so unfortunately I'm out I appreciate that thank you so there's the story you all there's still Robert still Robert I think you have a level of humility yeah that really comes through thanks and I think people always think to be a great entrepreneur you have to be arrogant you have to be full of yourself it's the complete opposite you've got to learn in life all the time we're all learning I mean I love that and I love the product I just like I'm I'm trying to talk myself into it sure I it's a tough sell it absolutely is my don't tell any but never put yourself down never ever do that okay always believe in yourself despite the challenge Robert you can solve this problem with $500,000 you get 10% I wish it was less money cuz I'd love to believe and invest in you but it's can't get there for 500,000 I'm sorry that's okay I appreciate you all this has been ABS honor it's been wonderful learning experience for me luck good luck by it's much more overwhelming than I thought it would be I think they saw me they saw they respected what I did and they saw the very real issues that I kind of created and so I I think I'm okay with that you know for

[Music] Hi, I'm Aisha. And I'm Fahim. And we're seeking $200,000 in exchange for 10% of our business moment. Have you ever had one of those stressful afternoons in the office? The ones that are filled with endless meetings, deadlines, and todos. I know I have.

Well, that used to be the case until this moment. Moment is a natural botanical beverage that reduces stress and feels like meditation. Moment uses a proprietary formulation that stimulates the same alpha brain waves as does meditation. We use three primary active ingredients to make that happen. Elanine, a natural extract of green tea for focus. Number two is Ashwagandha, an ancient ardic root for calmness. And number three is Tulsi, our holy basil, an adaptogenic herb for stress relief. [Laughter] Moment is the first product in the world that lets you drink your meditation. And what makes it even better is that each moment has less than 15 calories, no sugar, no caffeine, nothing artificial, and oh my goodness, each one is absolutely delicious. Sharks, stress is a major problem today more than ever, and this is the moment to solve it, man. I mean, what a performance. Yeah. So, Sharks, now it's time for you to take a moment for yourself. We've got all three of our flavors for you to sample. On your left, uh, you've got Tulsi Lemon, a drink I grew up having in Pakistan. You've got Roy Blood Orange inspired by South Africa, which is where Fahim is from. Um, is there any artificial sweetener in here? There's no artificial. Nothing artificial at all. This is pretty damn good. This is good. Love it. Great. That's great to hear. I love the space of dealing with the chronic stress in our country. Yeah. A company that I'm a co-founder of right now made for. That's our entire mission. I meditate every day. It's had a huge impact on my life. Um not to be cynical, but I don't understand how a drink is going to give me the same feeling of this practice that I've cured over years and years. Absolutely. Uh we found that meditation helped us be a lot more focused, a lot more creative, but all our friends found it very difficult to actually get into. And one of the key reasons that we started this was to help people get an entry point into meditation. We're trying to create a habit in a person's daily life. And every time somebody actually subscribes for moments, a portion of our proceeds actually goes to helping kids in school learn about mindfulness. Great. Tell us about you. Yeah. Where'd you go to drama school? So I have been working in supply chain and logistics for the last 10 years. Um I grew up in Pakistan where my dad was a small entrepreneur. I was fortunate enough to um get into Harvard Business School which is how I ended up moving here. Um my dad would have been so proud to see me here today had he been alive. I um you know honestly it was it's been a very difficult journey. My dad was amazing. I remember when I got into college there was people calling him and telling him that he should not send me to college because that's not the right decision given I was a girl but my parents they stood up against everyone. And not only that when I graduated uh from college I wanted to pursue a professional life. My parents pushed back against everyone to make sure I didn't get into an arranged marriage situation. I wanted to go explore the world and my parents supported me through that and that's how I ended up going to South Africa like I found a job there. I moved there and that's when I met Fahheim. So I'm from South Africa. I uh have always been involved in this kind of entrepreneurial space. Uh my last startup was fortunate enough to be funded by Google and was chosen as the best startup in South Africa at the time. What was it? Uh it was a a consumer tech startup that helped people share and discover shopping deals. Love the backstory. Now tell the front story. Now we're going to talk about moment. Awesome. What is the game plan for world domination? Honestly, we got into the beverage industry. We realized that we were cockroaches in the industry because of all these bohemoths and because of the margin structure and distribution. That's why we chose an online first distribution model. So, we just launched a month and a half back and we've already done $15,000 in sales. We've grown 400% and are on track to do $1.5 million of sales this year. And what's the price for each one and what it cost you? Yeah, so we sell it for $169 excluding shipping. It costs us 90 cents to make it right now. Uh shipping per can is about 80. Do you know what your customer acquisition cost is yet? Uh it's a little bit over $20. a $20 customer acquisition cost on how much an initial order? Between uh an $18 and a $30 initial you're losing money on the first order. That's totally right. But we are really driving towards a subscription model which drives us towards our longerterm value. And honestly, our purpose is to really understand the customer and build that relationship. You guys, I mean, I see what you're trying to accomplish. It's let's get people who are into this lifestyle excited. You're selling on the improvement that you find in your life. That's your value proposition. You know, that's where the real value comes. And this just happens to be the delivery mechanism that you've chosen. The question becomes, is this the right vehicle? And at $30 every two weeks or 15, that's going to be a challenge for me. And so, for those reasons, I'm out. The beverage industry is probably the most difficult industry on earth to gain share in. Um, let's talk with that for a moment. We We embrace the fact that it's hard. Yeah. But wait, it gets better. Never in the history of beverage from the time of Genghaskhan has anybody got a subscription model to work ever. Never. Not once. But wait, you're going to try and do that. So, um, on the first problem, breaking into an impossible sector. And secondly, doing something that's never been done before. And you want a valuation of $2 million on something you just started. Wait, wait, wait. Now we go to Greek mythology. Oh, no. We don't have enough time for this because we do not have enough time. Tom was cursed to carry the earth on his back. That's what you're doing. I really like you guys. We really like you as well, but you couldn't have come into the tank with with more weight on you than this. I'm out. Listen, first off, I just have to say you not only do your father proud, but you do all women proud. Thank you. Your packaging is beautiful. I love it. It draws you right to it. But for me, I feel that um this concept, the subscription concept part of it, I'm not sure about because I'm not sure that people want to have delivered their drinks. For that reason, I'm sorry. I'm out. Thank you. We appreciate those kind words. I do agree that you can get subscription models, but in a different way. I think if you had a concentrated form, I have a subscription model for um turmeric and a lot of other vitamins, which I think that you could concentrate this and put a little bottle and squeeze it into water, but I'm not here to change your business model. I see there potentially a lot of challenges. So, with that, I'm out. Thank you. Thanks for the feedback. Okay, it's me. I I think that Moment's an amazing name. I love that you're taking a portion of the proceeds of your company and giving them back to helping children learn to meditate. Um, I'm also a huge believer in science and using science to help address the chronic stress that millions of Americans uh experience every day. The problem here is I would be a hypocrite if I said that I think a drink can do what everything else I think in my life has shown me and that is you got to do the work and you got to do the habits so you can get to a place where you can address these stresses of modern living. So because of that I'm out. Sorry guys. Thank you very much for all your feedback. Appreciate it guys. Congratulations on what you've accomplished. Thank you. We started this business because we wanted to have a real impact on people's lives and we're still as excited as ever about doing this. So from here on it's uh getting moments out to the rest of America. ", "Yumble": "hey sharks my name is David Parker and I'm Joanna par Englewood New Jersey welcome thank you we're the we're the founders of yumble and we're here seeking 5 000 in exchange for four

for 15. and I would be a spokesperson there you go there you go all the issues these guys have brought up are very valid but if that's the way everyone thought entrepreneurs would never create Brands

partner and then who understands operationally how to improve your customer acquisition Etc and I think that I'm willing to give you the 500 000 but I think your evaluation is too steep so I think

product I've made you a good offer that's what I'm talking about that is the winner riding all the way to the bank good place ", "PANDALOON": "next into the tank is a business started by a viral hit [Music] hi sharks my name is Eugena and I'm from San Clemente California I have to apologize my business partner isn't here yet he couldn't keep track of time of his life depended on it can't get himself dressed in the morning sometimes Huxley Huxley come on what is that don't be afraid this panda is domesticated I'm Eugena and this is Huxley the panda puppy we're here seeking 60 000 for 20 of our company pantaloon our panda puppy costume transforms your pet into the perfect walking teddy bear now your dog doesn't have to be just a dog he can be a turducken of cute have a look oh my goodness [Laughter] [Music] that is sick that is so sick not only does the panda Pepe costume epitomize the magical cuteness of a walking teddy bear but it's also engineered for the perfect fit your pet wears the costume like a hoodie with the front legs through the lower bare lips and unlike those cheap velcro costumes the back adjusts to your pet's neck and chest girth that dog's gonna have issues though all right people are going crazy for this little Panda he's received more views than Beyonce's last music video how many views over 140 million actually went viral by accident I had a store in the theme of pandas and um made a video just for fun on Halloween and it just went nuts so we started with pandas and now we have the panda puppy friends [Music] [Laughter] I also brought samples for each of you would you mind uh someone gets to hold the panda and you can take him out if you like Mr wonderful thank you very much thank you Eugena this is good quality thank you yeah is it possible to put Huxley in this one sure yeah thank you so do you need a small rat sized dog or can you have a larger dog they get sized to fit larger dogs that's part of what I tried to make sure I designed it for was to fit a variety of dog shapes you know what's your background well I'm from San Clemente California a little Beach Town my parents immigrated here from Taiwan so I went on did well in school I got my masters in computational science my bachelor's in math and applied science I was pursuing research in computational neuroscience at the Salk Institute where I use genetic algorithms to optimize a neural network I also teach math and you do this so I graduated during the height of the recession since I graduated I have been stringing together three four five part-time jobs and so that's what really drove me to start this business have you sold any or taken pre-orders yes or I'm actually in the middle of the manufacturing process they'll be ready in about one month what are your costs it's about four dollars landed depending on the size and then what do you charge what's the retail I've been uh posting the retail price at 39.99 but demon I researched the largest costume manufacturer in the world and they actually have costumes that are animal themed as well and their price point was about the same actually for a far less quality of product I think that's a perfect price all right well I created two sizes so far oh not quite as good as the panda but still good so right now you're taking pre-orders correct yeah very quiet and how did you do that though pandaloon is my online store we've been in business for about three years we do about a hundred thousand Revenue every year what do you sell we sell just apparel gifts a lot of things with pandas something is without so Eugena would we be buying a portion of pandaloon which you've currently already have or this new concept of the costume I went ahead and bundled it all together because I know that obviously I don't have you know an impressive sales figure to show you these costumes but I do have proof that I can sell three hundred thousand dollars worth of inventory over the lifetime business I've been profitable since my very first year I've done it all myself okay what exactly do you need the money for in order to go ahead and expand my costume into a line I would need to have the inventory ready for this Halloween so in order to do that I would need an investment of a bare minimum of sixty thousand dollars to get most of these skews to meet their minimum order quantity so Gina I'm fascinated it's a heck of a story and obviously I I found the outfit to say the least intriguing but I have to be honest with you I've never really understood people that dress up rat dogs and outfits it's just bizarre I'm not suggesting you are I'm just saying I'm out okay okay I think you're phenomenal I was more interested in the neural network side of it but seriously I think you do great it's just not a fit for me so for that reason I'm out in Eugenia I'm sorry I just don't see a huge market for this I'm out Eugene I think the fact that we all almost curled over laughing I think bringing that Joy is is evident I have an album for you I'll give you the 60 000 for 35 and I'm gonna donate 10 of my 35 to animal charities so Eugena I'm gonna make you an offer foreign I like this and I like you [Music] three sharks are out Eugenia has an offer on the table from Damon for her pet costume business pandaloon but Sarah is also interested Eugena I'm gonna make you an offer I like this and I like you oh you're kidding I'm not kidding okay I'm gonna match Damon's offer I'm Gonna Give You sixty thousand dollars for 35 I have more that I can bring to the table with my platform and all of the women that I'm reaching out to and I think that most of the people that are going to buy costumes for their dogs are women I think your special I can tell that you're gonna make this work so thank you so much I really appreciate that so you have two great sharks two great offers on the table would you ever entertain a deal together are you willing to give away more equity yeah yeah I'd be open to that I'll be very honest I I have respect with Sarah I don't know her history here she probably can't add a massive amount of value but I think I'm gonna ride with this alone I'm gonna stick with my offer Regina you got to make a decision Damon I know that you are an awesome person to work with in the Pet Market [Music] so I would love to accept your offer all right so crazy congratulations congratulations good job [Music] [Applause] is a product that the entrepreneur s hope will become a popular Halloween tradition [Music] hello sharks my name is Rob boulay and I'm his sister-in-law Lara Riley and we are switch which from Salem Massachusetts sharks we are seeking 55 000 for 25 equity in our company for parents the scariest part of Halloween is too much candy switch which is a children's book and doll that solves that problem and the real magic is it's fun hey guys hi how was trick-or-treating oh all right come on over here look at all of your kids go ahead guys sit right down on the end of the bag okay we're going to read the switch Story the sun goes down it's time for bed go brush your teeth you sleepyhead leave your sweets with your switch which friend when kind of questions okay lie down for bed guys that's the way the switch which comes go ahead [Applause] while you're asleep these words will ring you might might hear your switch which sing [Music] Er When morning comes up with the sun guys wake up look look your gift something you'll love it's sure to be three cheers fun okay guys thanks so much [Applause] [Music] sharks we know our product is fun for kids in a problem solver for parents but we need your help in this magical journey take switch to every household Across America every Halloween so let me get this right you basically take the kids candy and when they wake up their Candy's gone you're not worried about litigations not when they see the gift they've received from their situation yeah so the way the um whole idea came up is my kids came home Halloween night 2013 and my wife yells to me Rob Rob do we have anything to give the kids and I'm like what are you talking about you go switch which is coming I said who is the switch witch my kids threw every ounce of candy they had right up on the countertop and we obviously didn't have anything for him I actually threw him five bucks each we took the candy away I said wow what a brilliant idea sure Rob let me understand the concept yes I'm a child thank you I come home with my candy I dump it after all that candy I look forward to all year and you give me this in exchange actually the switch which leaves and we don't encourage kids to leave all of their candy all they only give up some of them are just this no or you give them a gift if something like this basically has to be viral on its own it can't be forced so I'm trying to I haven't heard of it my kids haven't heard I've never heard of it yeah so that makes me concerned that it's not viral and it's being forced what's amazing to me is and when Yahoo did a thing on us on October 30th our sales jump like crazy unfortunately was October 30th um it ended up our Facebook ended up going viral the seasonality of this idea is brutal and the next day after Halloween no one cares that's kind of like saying no one cares about Christmas because you have one day and then it's over yeah you said the concept's been around for a while correct so that's why this is public domain it is so tell us by unit what it sells for what it costs you and then in aggregate what your sales are um we ran into some trouble um manufacturing uh we did it all in the United States um so we started at 29.95 it's a plush toy for 29 a little state in the packaging and we priced it at Elf on the Shelf mention the bench mention a bench Laurie where were you selling them and how many did you really sell we sold 815 units in our first season 52 percent was online Amazon and our own website we did 24 Grassroots I was out knocking on doors I was in Salem Massachusetts we were at craft fairs people loved this product for yourselves twenty four thousand our sales were 15 700. parents are having a hard time with it Why didn't it take off we feel it did I mean it was our first season um we did that with sales in one month from Grassroots look the Merit of reducing sugar is right on Trend however for an investor this is a non-proprietary plush doll with no brand right I've never heard of it I think you should take the cue from what actually happened in Salem in the old days you used to burn the witches if I were you I'd take this behind the barn and burn it because I think it sucks [Music] I'm out especially with the media that you had guys I mean nobody ever walks onto the carpet and says people don't like our product right of course we expect you to say and and think that people loved it but it didn't sell it's not like you ran out a product the big media push was the day before Halloween and mostly the only venue for people to get the product was online people were paying overnight shipping so after they saw the Yahoo article so that they could get it in time for Halloween I think you know for me I love Halloween I loved it of getting free candy so I I can't get behind it I I don't see it I'm out okay thank you Robert we're really trying to build a whole family tradition around it we did a deal with Mensch on a bench and there's so many days of Hanukkah same as with the elf it's on the shelves for so many days but here it's like a one night one-time thing whereas both of those models it's many days and a lead up this is a I'm up because Lori can I translate what you just said what she said is your idea sucks well guys Halloween is 7.4 billion dollar industry you just broke the cardinal rule when someone comes in and tells us it's just an enormous multi-billion dollar industry suggesting that oh if we just get a tiny amount we'll be okay and you know what I'm not buying it I think you're introducing more stress than you're solving I mean because as a parent and I have three young kids too right they're young enough we're still taking them around when they come back we're grabbing the bag throwing half of them away letting them pick their best and getting it done I just think you know it's hard to push something forward and make it viral it kind of has to be organically viral so for those Reasons I'm out thank you Mark and then there was one first of all this could be a hobby which could be great you can grow into something big food was a hobby for me at first I think it's a great hobby that may grow into something amazing it just may be too soon for me so I'm out very much good luck guys thank you good luck we came here we thought for sure we'd get up here there's no question that the Sharks missed out on a great opportunity we are going to be the next mentioning bench and out for the Shelf next into the tank is an entrepreneur who believes there's big money to be made from Big scares [Music] everywhere I go there's zombies hi sharks I'm Melissa Carbone from Los Angeles my company is 1031 Productions and I'm seeking two million dollars in exchange for 10 of my company yeah 1031 Productions is an entertainment company that creates owns and produces live attractions in the horror our most popular attraction is the Los Angeles haunted hayride and it is not for the faint of heart sharks when you take our hayride you are entering the pitch black woods where demonic forces lost souls Psychopathic fun are waiting around every turn [Music] everybody likes just when you think the terror is over think again he likes you don't eyeball me I will kick your tush back okay Melissa you know what's really scaring the crap out of me is your evaluation so two million dollars for ten percent imputes a 20 million dollar value on this scary hair ride business tell us why you're worth 20 million dollars we do attractions all year long we have the Los Angeles haunted hayride which is is our seasonal attraction here in La 17 nights we sell out every single night we do about 1.8 million dollars right now per October 1.8 was really good it's 17. we have another attraction called the Great Horror Campout that we just launched which is the summer attraction the Great Horror Campout is our way of not being a seasonal company that is an overnight completely immersive camping experience poor theme oh no so it's 12 hours we bait we we take 2 000 campers we put them in tents and we have an incredibly interactive experience that includes everything from a hill it's basically summer camp from hell yeah 1.8 million in at the end of the 17 days what's left it costs us 1.2 million dollars to produce the Los Angeles haunted hayride so I'm left with 600 000 free cash afterwards yeah I mean it varies year to year because right now we're in a launching new attractions mode we're launching a New York haunted hayride which is what we're seeking some of this money for the Great Horror Campout we're launching it next year in 10 cities up the West Coast so therein lies the rub right because they're very very very expensive to produce and create right well the campouts are cheap to produce how much advertising and promotion do you do three hundred thousand dollars radio for 10 years so my advertising marketing and one of my other business partners actually still with Clear Channel so we know how to make a dollar go really far from a market how many Unique Individuals come through the hayride we have we have 50 000 people we sell out every single night so this year is our first year we increase our Max Capacity to a hundred thousand eight hundred we actually are doubling our Max Capacity this year every night for 17 days every night that's amazing so can I extrapolate and say that the it's going to be 3.6 million in Revenue this year yes if we sell out so that means this thing will generate just over a million bucks if everything works right okay now you're an intelligent woman I'm trying to make the leap now we have to get back to reality on your 20 million dollar ask yeah let's give you a fair chance of making a million bucks before tax okay yep that's about 700 000 after tax if I gave you a 10 multiple you're worth seven million bucks how is it that I am going to pay 20 for a seven million dollar business if everything goes right that's the horror story you brought here you've overvalued your business we've had major entertainment companies in La who have already given us offers to buy our company and this is about what they're valuing it why are you such a greedy Pig I not greedy I have lots of lots of high hopes for the company just because a Hollywood Bozo offered you a 20 million dollar valuation you know what the horror show is listen to argue about valuation all the time but they want to just give her two million dollars to ten percent projecting for the New York haunted heroid which hasn't happened yet because it's the same model in La we're just plopping it down geographically it's a different model because it never rains in L.A Melissa I I don't agree that your brisk analysis is correct it never happens that everything you rolled out successful day one that's ridiculous for me it is not hard to get lots of people to come to the attractions the hard part is to make it a great experience so they want to come back this is all fun and games but we're talking about money here I can't I can't get there I'm out Melissa for you to come close to your projections for next year everything has to work perfectly all the time I don't see you getting to those numbers next year I'm out for me right now to give you two million dollars I feel you would take a really long time for me to see that back so for that reason I'm up foreign the risk is not as great as you probably would think I mean we will launch these attractions no matter what I know that we can launch them Faster by having this money we can launch them now I'm an expert in high octane scare you are yes I can tell you a way to do this much cheaper wear a piece of jewelry and walk around where I grew up yeah that will give you a high octane fair enough uh I would just have to insult you with my offer um go ahead and shelter that's about what it's worth throw the offer yeah okay well then I'll give you two million dollars for 40 percent okay all right come on Mark is that a yes or no to him um can I counter of course you can counter um two million for 20 percent I'll take that offer done really yep awesome wow thank you [Music] um for helping you on that totally you can have free tickets without a haunted hayride thank you so much appreciate it I don't know what just happened wait a minute I lost out on a deal come to think yeah you just did I think that the next generation of entertainment is experiential entertainment where people get out of the house and go and get a unique experience I thought for me to get my money back if I did that deal for two mil I'd have to rise from the dead and look like that before you already have Kevin mark on board and two million dollars this is the biggest deal ever I'm so excited this changes the game for us [Applause] before you go don't forget to subscribe to the Shark Tank Youtube channel and

bones get older our muscles just don't recover as quickly that's for sure that's why I go see this guy for help as a physical therapist I use specific tools and techniques like muscle scraping to help enhance blood circulation reduce pain and speed up the recovery process yep Dan's worked Wonders on my body but I can't bring him home with me that's why we teamed up to create sore soap the world's first do-it-yourself device made from allnatural analgesic essential oil powered soap it's designed to replicate the same Physical Therapy tool you could get at a doctor's office you know soap's been around for centuries as a matter of fact muscle scraping has been too we're just the first to combine them so switch your old boring bar to sore soap just 90 seconds in the shower of scraping your

yep we sell in some physical therapy offices and some Boutique gyms manatt between 15 and 17 okay that's margin for retail let me make a point about the product category for a second okay there's a deal here on Shark Tank called Blue land it's it's in the cleaning fluids and detergent business and I invest in that deal I learned something about this category retail is two tiers of distribution for cleaning fluids so you're going to have to sell it in for about 11 bucks but it's it's going to be a very expensive soap look guys I have I have a horse in the race in blue Land good luck to you thank you I'm out you know I wanted to jump back to something because I before you jump back I want to clear the deck a bit everybody is in the soap business and I also think this will never do well in the large stores because you can't demonstrate it I think it's a very difficult sell Beyond direct to Consumer so for that reason alone amount we appreciate your time thank you David it's a really great idea it's a great product but as an investor I tend to look for things that are going to be a little more expansive maybe more of a product category not a single skew definitely be a customer so I'll buy it but I'm out for the deal understand I would like to bring this one up other point up I think what you did is smart I do think it's a DTC I'm not sure about it being in the store I think

that Gap and now we got the businessman", "Y'all Sweet Tea": "[Applause] Next up, two entrepreneurs brewing up a sweet southern staple. [Music] Hello, Sharks. My name is Darien Craig and I'm Brandon Eckles. We're here today seeking $500,000 in exchange for 5% of our company. Hello. We're from the little town of Hayden, Alabama and we've known each other since we were 6 years old. We graduated from high school together. dropped out of college together and somehow out of all these years we've never been in a fight. Well, there's one argument that we've never seemed to settle and that argument is who makes the best sweet tea. I always thought my nana made the best tea and I would argue my mom makes the best tea. So, we decided to combine the two, settle that debate, and build the best tea brand in the world. And in 2021, we launched our company, Y'all Sweet Tea. When we launched Y'all Sweet Tea, I realized that other tea brands were not properly utilizing social media and influencers. So, we doubled down on social media and built a team of influencers that know a thing or two about sweet tea. So, Sharks, let me introduce you to one of our top influencers who has over 1 million followers, Mama Sue. Mama Sue. Everybody knows Mama Sue. Our influencers are Southern Grandmas. That's brilliant. Hey, sharks. I may not know all those fancy dances on social media, but I've been drinking tea for 71 years. And honey, I can tell you y'all sweet tea is the best I've ever had. Now, the boys have put samples on each of your tables, both sweet and unsweet, as well as a flavored tea. Mark, you've got our strawberry flavored tea. And Miss Barbara, you've got our watermelon tea. Lori, we have mango for you. And Rashan, we gave you our raspberry tea. What am I? Chopped liver. I only have two teas here. No, I tried to put enough sugar in here to sweeten you up. So, yes, you did. But I don't know if that's possible. So, what I did was I'm giving you our fan favorite Georgia peach. I think it may do the trick to just sweeten you up. That's fantastic. Thank you. So, Sharks, who's ready to make a sweet deal with y'all sweet tea? It's very, very good. The watermelon is amazing. Oh, it's delicious. Thanks, mama. Thank you, mama. Thank you. Sounds like tomi. Thanks, mama. So, what is it sweetened with? Like, I have unsweet and I have sweet and I have mango tango. Inside each bag is 10 filter packs you can make one gallon of tea with. And you can make it however sweet you want it. You add your own sugars. What you correct? Whatever sweetener you want. What do they cost you to make? We have about $2.67 67 in a package of tea. We wholesale that for $4.34 and then we retail on our website for $7.25. Are you making any money? Yeah. So, we're only 3 years in. So, you know, the sales are we're happy about them, but uh I You don't look happy. I'm real glad to say that to date we've just passed $10.3 million since 2021. So, I'll go back walk us through the years. Walk us through the years. So, in 2021 we did $1.2 $2 million. In 2022, we did $2 million. Wow. In 2023, we doubled that to $4 million. And this year, year to date, we're already at $3 million and project to do 5 million plus this year. That's amazing. What are your margins? Last year, we profited 20%, almost $800,000. Thank you. This year, we're pretty much break even. Um, we doubled down on Facebook ads this year. We had never ran any. Everything's direct to consumer. 85% of our sales comes directly to our website. Do you have any physical retailers like box? Yes. Uh so we are in about 600 grocery stores mainly throughout the southeast, but we want to go into big box stores. That's our next big plan. Uh we've even had some discussions with Walmart a few months back. They talked to us about doing a 500 store uh test. Have you guys raised money? We have not. Yep. We own better. Good for you guys. No investors, no loans. We're So that leads to the question like last year you said you did 4 million, right? and you made 20%. Yes, sir. Right. So, you put $800,000 pre-tax in your pocket, right? Why not continue to grow and keep on putting money in your pocket or reinvesting that as opposed to just throwing it all into advertising just to get a few more dollars in sales? What was your logic there? Sure. We just see the really big potential of the of the company. And we thought that putting everything back into marketing would help grow us to be a brand that is recognizable once we get into the big box. So, which would you rather have? A brand that is recognized or be rich as I think you guys were trying to double sales. You just didn't. So, you made the right decision by reinvesting. But, you should have gotten a return. Look, if you're getting a return on your advertising, your your profits would grow as well, right? It means that you're spending money on a lot of other things. So, are you paying all kinds of listing fees, etc. to be in there? We're not. But I I do have an one answer to your question is last year we launched the flavored tees. We had never done flavors before. It was just the regular tea. Our fans were saying, "Y'all got to do flavors. You have to do flavors." So, we literally made a post and said, "Which flavors do you want us to do?" They said, "Try a peach." When we launched that bag that Kevin's got, we sold 10,000 of those bags in 35 minutes on our website. Really? The first 8 minutes of that was $100,000 in sales. And we truly think that could have been a million dollar day on our website. Walmart needs you. You don't need Walmart, right? And I I'm I'm look I'm starting to agree with Cuban because when you're dropping that amount in that short period on your own site, that's rare. Do you know how few entrepreneurs could make that claim? Beautiful. That is like a beauty. Yeah. Hey guys, I'll let you figure it out. I've heard enough. I'll give you 500K for 10%. And I'll let you figure out if you want to go to Walmart, if you want to stay direct to consumer or what balance of both. I think you guys are smart enough, charismatic enough. You don't need me to tell you how to run this business, but I'll give you money. I'll give you access. I'll give you influencers if you want. Not that you need it, but I think you guys are a rocket ship. And I think if you had the right money and the right resources, you can continue to grow. Thank you. That's incredible. Thank you so much for the offer. Thank you. Wow. I would snap that right up. I would too. Hey, what is your dream? What do you want to do? Our vision for the brand is to just continue growing it. We do see a vision of 10 million, $20 million in sales and then eventually be able to have an exit. That's what Rashan does, right? I like to make money. He doesn't care. He just wants to see the top line grow and see an exit. So, I'll go out because I'm a cash guy. He's a sales and growth guy. I'll go out, too, to clear the road for him. Well, well, I got to tell you, very few companies that walk in here have social media nailed like you guys have. Oh, yeah. I mean, that is very, very impressive. I know it when I see it. Yeah, I see it, too. I Let me just tell you my value ad. You're going to need more money even though you're profitable. You're going to be reinvesting that into more marketing, more influencers. You guys figured out the lifestyle part of tea, right? But I do think there's value from other sharks. That's why I'm interested to see what they say because these guys can help you get into where you inevitably are going already into the Walmarts and the Target with Rashan. I I would like to work on the retail piece. You can't do Walmart without a distributor. But once you set that up, you also do the other guys, the Targets and the Costco. I look, my deal would be give us 20% for the 500, I get 10, he gets 10, and I go nuts into retail with you. Okay. Thank Thank you for making an offer. Thank you. Okay. Well, the plot thickens over here cuz Lori wants to get involved and help scale this thing to the moon as well. Two sharks are out. Brandon and Darien have two offers on the table from Rashawn or Rashawn and Kevin for their sweet tea business, y'all. But Lori may also be interested. Lori wants to help scale this thing to the moon as well, and we will split the 500K for 15%. Well, I'll tell you why I like it. I have tons of products that have done extremely well in grocery. Um, you guys, just you. It's so impressive. This is fabulous packaging, fabulous name, and if I were walking down the grocery aisle, I'd go to this one. And so I want to be in on it, and I think we can blow it up, like be the name of tea. No one's been disruptive in tea for years. Excuse me, Lori. I've already made an offer with unless you are throwing me under the bus. I'm down either way. I offered you 500K myself for 10%. We split it for 15. I'll go in with him for 20. So you guys really think about the value. We all bring very different to be competitive. I'll go to 15 with Sean. More than anything, thank you all for this opportunity. The the offers were um awesome. However, our counter would be could we also raise some more cash to 750. So 750,000 for 15%. I'm staying at 500. I mean, I just bring too much value to it. There's only one Mr. Wonderful. I think we're kind of already at the max end of the amount of capital that I think you guys should be raising. I think if you guys take this amount and then once you knock the cover off the ball, we raise another round, we're at 2 or 3x, right? That valuation, you won't even notice the difference in the amount of basis points you're giving up right now. And if you did the math on that, you would see that it actually works out in your favor. Okay? So 500k 10% me 15% Lori and I Kevin are you 15 or 20? No I was going to drop down to 50 15% for Kevin but only 500k not 750. Okay you definitely want the guy moment this is you can decide between Lori and I and who you want to partner. Sure. Do you mind if we take 10 seconds turn around and have a discussion for it? Yeah. I like this. I love this though. I know. All right. Um, there is only one, Mr. Wonderful. We appreciate your offer, but we're going to decline at this time to accept Lori and Rashan's offer for 15%. All right, guys. Alabama in the building."}
