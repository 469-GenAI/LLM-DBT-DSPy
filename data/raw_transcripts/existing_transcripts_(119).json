{"GarmaGuard": "[Applause] next into the tank is a way to protect against germs and viruses [Music] hi sharks my name is pete badaway and this is my beautiful white bianca we're seeking 100 000 for 10 equity and our company sharks we want to introduce you to joe joe here he's just like all of us gets up gets himself ready puts his mask on and heads off to work the second joe leaves his house these nasty little germs which are filled with odor dirt grind and even bacteria are flying at them from all different directions [Music] i love it whether he's grabbing a quick latte yes at a crowded cafe walking past a sneezing co-worker and let's not forget all those nasties he picks up during his commute to and from work he's washing and cleaning his hands throughout the day but what's he doing about his clothes nothing sharks he does nothing that crazy nasty dirt that he's collecting throughout the day is still stuck on his clothes let's face the sharks we can't all walk around with these things on all day to keep us protected there are products to wash and clean our hands on the go but why not for our clothes which are even more exposed and that is why we created garment guard garment is the first natural garment and fabric cleanser of its kind which uses natural propellants to keep you safe and your clothes fresh and clean applying our garment spray it's easy you simply just spray it onto your clothes helps eliminate odor freshen your fabric and keep that dirt and grime under control there you go joe much better so no matter who you are or what you do garment guard gives you the freedom to live your life without having to wear one of these things on all day to keep you protected so which one of you sharks wants to team up with us to help garma guard the world sharks we have some samples in front of you first we're going to get out of these suits and get joe on his way out of here i really enjoyed that high school play yeah that was fun it was very good bad theater okay so my very first business was a pickup and delivery laundry and dry cleaning company yes this could really save someone a lot of money on dry cleaning because half of the reason people would bring their clothes to me especially in college their clothes smell like smoke so my first question is is like will this take away smoke smell and not have to take the dry cleaning absolutely we've gotten amazing feedback from firefighters and um i'm a police detective myself so i work very close to uh firefighters and they they call me like pete this stuff's really good wow it works i mean the thing is is very few people ever wear socks when they wear toms and if you don't wear socks they start to stink and there's no editor how does it work how does it extract the odor it actually eliminates odor causing bacteria so it's killing the bacteria yes it is yeah it's lab tested it does kill bacteria kills 99 of germs we can't make those claims because we're not epa registered yet so we're selling it as a cleaner now but we know how effective it is viruses two then yes cobin big question yeah we don't have that kill claim yet and that's clearly the way that your ceilings are gonna grow a ton as if with that in mind tell us about your sales we've been in business for a year and a half now to date our sales are 476 000. all right half a million dollars of sales is not a joke you know it's that's that's a good number is this your business that you've always been in or so i'm actually a nurse um i've been working up until three months ago we had our third daughter so congratulations congratulations thank you thank you thank you so the idea came up actually from being a nurse i would come home and i wouldn't want my girls touching me i wouldn't want pete giving me a hug yet i felt so dirty after my shift and just watching this day after day i knew that we need we needed a product to use on our clothing on our uniforms on our scrubs throughout our day before we come home and if none exist we need to make one so where are you selling it right now what are you doing to amplify your sales so right now we're selling uh on our website as well as a couple other websites you're only online right now yes okay so how much do you sell these for and what does it cost you to make so we sell them for 12.99 and they cost a dollar 85 to make okay so you got enough money to support a nice fortune so guys you you've made these sales um but the golden ring here it seems to me given where we're at in this pandemic if this said kills covid on your clothes i think that would be a really good message we're going to get it what's the timeline to get that because i think that's the question that we're all going to ask we're all going to focus on so that would change your business dramatically uh six months to a year i would say if i had to estimate look guys look it's a great product it smells good obviously works real well but every day i get an email from somebody saying they have this new whiz-bang formula and you guys hear about competition all the time i'm sure right so the reality is you have to be a great marketing company right and you're just starting to learn how to do that so i don't think you're quite ready for my investment i'm out all right thank you mark appreciate that guys i understand why you can't give me what i want what i wanted was a little picture of the coronavirus with a big red x through it we're working on it we're working on this one we started in 2017 to me that's the marketing dream it's not just covered mr wonderful i mean this this this um feeling of cleanliness and staying sanitized and clean isn't going anywhere so i get i get it i can't get it it's not for me but you two are terrific thank you anyways i'm out thank you thank you thank you thank you i uh think that this is a good enough business that you may not need a partner i think you guys can scale this to being a million two million and doing it without a partner so i'm out appreciate that dave you know um i think that this is a really good product i think it smells fantastic and i think you're right on the money right now people would just love to take something fresh and non-chemical and spray it on their clothes afterwards i'm absolutely going to be a customer i like it a lot but it's just so early i think you're going to do great but i'm sorry i'm out thank you lori appreciate the feedback thank you then there was one yeah man laundry days laundry days um before i made my final decision i just there's one question i never got answered and that is your total sales has been 476 000 over the lifetime of the business what your sales gonna be this year and what's your profitability going to be this year because you have huge margins yeah so we'll hit uh at least 500 000 this year and our margins are around 20 so we'll make 100 000 off that 500. [Music] you know i think you have a great business here i think you have great margins i actually don't think you need the equity investment if you're going to make that profitability today for many many years i never took investors and that's how i was able to have a very big exit my recommendation to you guys is get this approval and whatever you need so that you can say this can kill kovid and that your sale is going to take off and you're going to be able to fund it with the cash flow of the direct sales so but you're buying in early before we make that claim right yeah i know but evaluation's gonna go up we have 14 000 customers loyal customers our conversion rate is 6.6 percent our return customer rates 33 the covet claim is just the cherry on top man i'm telling you i i think the statistics you keep throwing at are just making my case even stronger for you don't need an investment right now you just need to keep grinding and you're going to look back and you're going to have millions more dollars in your pocket because you didn't give up equity right now and then you're going to take me to dinner for giving me that advice love you guys but i'm out appreciate it thank you congratulations guys thank you thank you for both of your services thank you thank you thank you guys [Music] you know blake i didn't have any investors i scrapped it all out i kept with all the money that i made i kept putting it back into the business and the business was always mine and i think that's such an important message for people watching to hear because i think we glorify investing and i mean this show is all about investing and there's times when an equity investment especially from a shark and a great partner is critical to your growth but in this case i think they're going to be great they don't need to you ", "Roadie": "[Music] next up is a solution to a common anxiety for electric vehicle owners [Music] hi i'm chris and i'm josh and we're two of the co-founders of spark charge based in somerville massachusetts we're here today seeking a million dollars for a six percent stake in our company everyone knows electric vehicles are the future they're better for the environment and soon they'll be everywhere but there's one major thing keeping them from growing faster range anxiety range anxiety is the fear of running out of charge in your electric vehicle that's why i would love to introduce you to the roadie the world's first and only portable modular and ultra fast ev charger the anxiety of finding a charging station and the time wasted waiting for a vehicle to charge simply goes away when the charging station comes to you no matter where you are the roadie has three core features number one modularity units can be connected together to give the electric vehicle owner the exact amount of range they want number two portable our portable units can charge an electric vehicle anytime and anywhere making any location a charging station and of course the most important factor speed we can charge an electric vehicle at a rate of one mile every 60 seconds so sharks help us create a more sustainable mobile ev charging infrastructure okay and walk us through it so how would i purchase wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait yep wait wait one second i don't know anything about this i'm out thank you thank you so yeah it's really simple so we actually sell directly to businesses so we work with oems roadside companies on-demand companies and service companies they use the hardware and they go out there and they charge electric vehicle owners who request it so aaa we carry this aaa customer right now we do have a program going on right now the question is how much does it cost you to make one of those per module what do you sell them for so per module our cost of goods are roughly around 2 500 and then companies pay a thousand dollar deposit and then we charge them 150 buck monthly fee okay so it's 150 bucks per month per module yep yes in the past six months alone we've done close to over half a million in sales and we're on track to do over a million in sales this year alone by the end of next year we're predicting to do close to 10 million in sales this unit itself it's patented through and through we developed it from the ground up we also built our own manufacturing facility in buffalo new york we've also been really strategic with our funding but we've won a lot of grants and awards to get us there how much money have you raised from investors versus grants that you received i'd say we've probably raised about three million in venture and the rest has been about awards which comes about two million so far very smart and so what percentage of the company do you guys owe now versus what the investors own uh we have we have we have a little over 50 but why do you believe you'll go to 10 million you went from 500 000 you double that congratulations to 1 million and now you're going to 10 exit why do you believe you'll go to that so the electric vehicle industry is growing rapidly essentially the reason that we're here today and that's a great point is that we need to scale to keep up with demand obviously you have to burn some cash to get to where you are now how much have you lost to get to here uh since the beginning i think the burn rate is just a little over about four or four million so you guys are in a bad spot right now no no no we haven't no you've raised four million right we raised five million total okay and you spent four so you got a million left correct and you've got in order to grow you need to invest to build more batteries correct all right you're basically leasing these things to people right correct how much capital do i have to tie up in inventory that's probably the best way to add that question about a third you're basically going to carry a third of revenue as least in other words you own it it's on your balance sheet wouldn't it be better to simply sell this and then let the attrition occur in the market because i think that's a big issue so you know we could sell it but by releasing it out essentially we control the asset and then when the batteries come back we can also repurpose them okay so tell me again what it cost you to make a 2500 and so your payback time is approximately 12 months how much are you charging that if it's 12 months and it's 25 if it's 150 a month okay a thousand dollar deposit oh they pay a thousand dollars or an actual thousand dollars for revenue it's a thousand dollar deposit it's not refundable so it's not a deposit then it's actually a thousand dollar payment yes i really love what you're doing here and i also think that you can have a direct consumer end of this down the road where they can put in their cars something smaller but will give them that little bit of peace of mind where they can get to somewhere where they're safe so we are going to be coming out with a consumer product the technology inside is somewhat the same it's just smaller size lighter package more consumer friendly look what would that retail for depending on scale we might be able to get it for under 1500. how many units are being used right now so today around 50. yes oh that's all right only 50 units you're backordered right now that's correct i hate the least part of the deal i hate owning risk that part you lost me there i'm out thank you kevin i appreciate it like lori i think the big opportunity is developing a consumer unit but i find it really hard to believe that you're going to deliver a consumer unit for a thousand bucks or less when your commercial units are thousands and so for that reason i'm gonna be out like i said i think it's super smart it is innovative i mean mark is mr technology like i will always look to him to understand things that i don't actually understand this this is more a capital issue so are you interested in mark cause yeah i mean i like the concept right so here's the challenge right the challenge is it's a lot of cash up front and you're gonna have to borrow money not raise money because if you raise more money then you guys aren't going to have any ownership left right unless you think it's going to be a multi-billion dollar company and we do believe it's going to be a multi-billion dollar company according to our estimations we can get to profitability without having to raise additional rounds by middle of next year so here's the thing okay six percent is nowhere near enough particularly for two of us right so lori i think the best way to do this is to let them make us an offer and we either say yes or no so you know what your number is instead of us trying to figure out your number and us going back and forth in the interest of time just give us your number right and if we like it we say yes and if we don't we say no um how about this how about we do a million dollars for 10 it's split 50 50 but we'll also throw in two percent advisor equity and a board seat two percent each um two percent each we can do two percent each so we would go 500 500 seven percent seven percent right and five five and two basically do we have a deal we got a deal we have a charge let's charge chance of you getting a deal was zero no no i just said yeah yeah i'm just saying i think the best person in this deal is lori who got a free ride although marquis isn't back she's a bottom feeder i like your style lori congratulations guys thank you guys it was the most exhilarating route of my life we really want to dig in and start building this business to be a billion dollar business what's the power of lori and mark spark charge is now fully charged to take over the world people don't realize when you raise money it's not an accomplishment it's an obligation exactly but our media celebrates it they celebrate raising money as if that's like profitability you ", "TouchUp Cup": "first into the tank is an

order private label you know distribution around 27. he just spits out because he didn't get to watch shark tank yeah i would love to help you grow this business so i would love to make you an offer you're asking for 150 000 for 10 i'd like to give us some more cash flows more runway so i'd like to do 200 000 for 25 wow thank you so much for that offer this guy just uh made a better offer than um i would and i was about to give up let carson hear a big ass said no but i was going to give 150 000 for 25 and now he did 225 so i'm forced to do 200 for 17 and a half to cut his legs out from underneath [Applause] are you serious i'm serious thank you for that offer that is a really interesting dilemma you've got there carson oh what a shark so i i'll make it simple guy i love you you guys are amazing but those guys have made great offers so for those reasons i'm out thank you thank you mark congratulations my dilemma is this i want carson to drop out of school and become a ceo i'm i just finished eighth grade i don't think that's an option right now i'm out and i'd have to agree thank you but i do have to ask you one question in regards to that who will be running the business because i can't work on it every day blake can't work on it every day who's going to work on everyday or will we have to hire somebody else you know if we were sitting in your shoes we'd be asking the same questions we want to get this to a point where i don't have to have the other job but the time right now is not right to no you're trying to keep the lights on in the house i get it right but at some time when you're working at midnight the buyers in retail they're up monday morning at 9 00 am calling people saying my shells are empty and if you're not there to pick up that phone at 9am they're calling your competitor so who's going to pick up that phone do we want to get this to a point where i can be full-time in this business absolutely absolutely but i can't at this moment i'm gonna have to revise my offer to 150 000 for 20 two sharks are out carson and jason have an offer from blake and one from damon for their paint storage product touch-up cup but the offers are changing once the sharks discover that no one is working full time in the business i'm going to have to revise my offer to 150 000 for 20 because i see right now that at least for a year is going to have to take uh administering money to other people to go out and do some of these jobs that's absolutely right damon i'm not changing my offer you've gotten two very good offers here from both of them someone like blake or like damon could sit and really work with you and teach you and give you some good advice whereas i would want you to have someone else run it for you so i'm gonna go out okay thank you for your time uh i have a question on your offer so would you be willing to fulfill purchase orders help us fulfill those purchase orders on top of that if it got um like uncontrollable to us i don't know until i get in there and really understand your business better but if i own 25 of this business and we need to you know fund purchase orders or inventory you know then it's gonna be in my best interest to make sure that i help arrange the line of credit at a bank for you damon same question to you as far as fulfilling purchase orders no i don't want to be the bank i want to use other people's money carson what do you want to do yeah so blake we really weren't hoping to give up 25 of our company would you be willing to compromise and say 17 and a half percent for 150 000 yes could you do it for the 200 000 no i don't think so i think my my best offer would be 150 000 for 17 and a half which is what damon but i really encourage you to give a little bit more away but also get that extra 50 000 in cash because i think it's going to help bring these ideas to life okay could you do 200 000 for 20 i love this kid i i love that you're asking but i really think the value that i'm gonna bring i need to own 25 equity what do you want to do buddy damon i would like to thank you for your offer that was really kind of you and i really appreciate it but blake you have a deal okay great thank you congratulations thank you guys well done thank you everybody i really appreciate you guys thank you thank you what's up blake good job we did it how do you feel man amazing with blake on our team the sky is the limit and we can reach any level of success to all the kid-preneurs out there just like me you know that you can get to this spot with a little hard work you can do your research and you can be right here where i am get a deal with one of the sharks and it feels amazing you ", "Deux": "Next in the tank is an indulgence with a modern twist. [Music] Hi Sharks. My name is Sabina Lada. I'm from Dallas, Texas and I currently live in Los Angeles, California. I'm seeking $300,000 for 10% of my company D. Wow. Over the past year, I've started taking fistfuls of supplements. Everything from zinc and elderberry to boost my immune system to aloe vera and vitamin C for my skin and even ashwagandha to calm myself down. I may seem like your typical LA health nut, but I love junk food. I mean, I grew up on this stuff. Introducing dough, enhanced cookie dough packed with vitamins and functional ingredients. A lot of other raw cookie doughs are made with things like refined sugars and preservatives and animal byproducts. Our cookie dough is made with things like oats, almond butter, flax seed, and coconut sugar. We've added in good for you functional ingredients. For example, this jar of chocolate chip cookie dough has the same amount of zinc as 3 lbs of chickpeas. This jar of brownie batter has the same amount of vitamin C as five whole oranges. We've made everything delicious, gluten-free, and vegan. Especially for you, Mark. Now, Sharks, who's ready to invest and roll in some dough? What are we trying? What are we trying? U Sharks, in front of you, we have our four flavors of cookie dough. You can eat them raw, straight from the jar, or you can make ooey gooey cookies. So, we've got some cookies for you as well. M really good. So there's 110 calories. Is this the serving? Yeah, I would say about about that size. We're not really calorie focused. We're focused more on the clean ingredients. That's obvious. Are you a food person? How'd you come up with this? Um, so my parents are immigrants and they immigrate from My mom was born in Pakistan and my dad was born in India. My dad didn't have much of an education and he kind of saved up enough money to buy a gas station and he lived there. I mean, 14 hours a day, 7 days a week. like it's a grind. Um, and you know who else lived there? This girl. And so I had all of my meals in that gas station on the weekends. You know, Oreos for breakfast, honey buns for lunch. I would make craft mac and cheese in the microwave for dinner. So, no surprise after college, my first job was working at one of the biggest food and beverage CPG companies in the world. But I was going through kind of a health transformation myself. And it was just at odds. So, I got out of food and beverage completely. Um, and then I went to venture capital. I knew I was entrepreneurial by nature, so I wanted to learn the startup world. And when did you launch Dough? I concepted DO in June of 2020. I launched You're brand new. Brand new. Oh, wow. Okay. Um, but my numbers will tell you otherwise. We did 70K from October to December and we've done 630K in revenue. What? Thus far. Good for you. And we're on track to do $1.2 million this year. How are you selling that much? And we just got approved at Whole Foods this morning. literally like 3 hours ago. Congratulations. Congratulations. I know. How many Whole Foods are you going into? So, it's about 40 stores. And then And what are they going to sell it for? And what are you selling it to them for? And what does it cost you? So, it cost us $3.70 to make landed at our fulfillment center. And we charge $15 a jar online. $15 a jar. Is that a premium? It is. It's a premium. Definitely. How much money have you raised? Um, I raised a million dollars. Wow. Wow. What? What valuation? At a $6 million cap. Whoa. Good for you. You are impressive. Thank you. You know how to sell. Sabino, 13 years. You're probably one of the most impressive entrepreneurs that stood on that carpet. I wish you all the success in the world. You're incredibly impressive, but I don't like sweets. I got to really want to try and eat the product, and I eat everything. This isn't for me. I'm out. Thank you. I appreciate it. when I look at this, I would love to have it be even healthier because that's just where my mind goes as a consumer. So, um, it's not really the right match, but I think you've done a good job of what you've done. I wish you good luck, but I'm up. Thank you, Sabina. There is so much to admire about you. My parents immigrated from India. I felt so close to you when you told that story. What do you think your father would think of you right now following this entrepreneurial dream and on Shark Tank? Yeah. I mean, I didn't mean to get choked up. Um I I think he would tell me I'm crazy probably because he did it because he had to do it and I do it because I get to do it. And so he'd probably think I was crazy, but he would be, you know, over the moon. I bet you he's extremely proud of you. Thank you. And you are living your version of the American dream. I would love to back you, but I'm an internet guy. I realized that this just really isn't for me. I'm out. I appreciate it. Thanks, Nerra. I too was very impressed, but at the end of the day, I don't eat this kind of food anymore. Now I'm not a kid and now I have to care. Well, you're I would say I mean with all due respect, you're not exactly the target consumer. I get it. I get it. But you told But that's not what I was trying to I am the target investor. That's the point. and I'm just telling you I can't invest in it. I'm sorry. I'm out. I appreciate it. Thank you, Kevin. Sabina, on one hand, look, we're not your demo, but at the same time, the calories are the calories and too many kids gaining too much weight is still a real problem in this country. If there was something here that I could hang my hat on to say as an alternative, I'd probably go for it because I think you're incredible. But it's not there. So, for those reasons, I'm out. I I guess just one thing before we wrap up. Um I like this is the culmination of my career. There is no other person that is more set to scale a business like this than me. Sabina, you are super impressive. Thank you. Sabina Sabina, you had a problem reading the room. And that's one of the challenges when it came to you. Whether it was comment to Kevin, we're not your demo cuz you were very clear. But you got to read the room to at least try to make us feel good about who we are and and investing. Okay. And I'm not trying to rip on her right now. I'm just telling you. I don't know if that's fair, Mark. I think it may not tell you what I felt. No, I'll take that feedback. You know, you can have your opinion. I can look at a product I may not like, but I respect the person. I think she's phenomenal. I think she's super smart, but it's more the product, right? I don't want to diminish you at all cuz you are phenomenal. Sabina, I got to tell you, I just want to back you. I can guide you as the business grows, but I want to be completely honest. Don't come to me and tell me which of the products or I I can't add any value that way. Yeah. This is purely an investment in Sabina and I think you're not going to fail. I appreciate that. I'll give you the 300,000 for 15%. Okay. I came in knowing I would have to take a haircut. I'm not going to negotiate with you. Would you do $300,000 for 12 1/2% and meet me in the middle? Every other person except you. I would almost be insulted by a counter like that. I mean, it's so trivial. But let's reset. 300,000 for 15%. That's my offer. Would you do 10% and 5% advisor shares? No. No. I'm I'm not going to do it. I'm not going to do it. I wanted to believe in you. Sometimes you make a bet because your heart tells you one thing. I didn't want you leave without a deal, but I also believed in you and the business. All right, I'll take it. No, I'm not going to do it. Whoa. I'm not going to do it. I I wanted to do it, but you don't need me as much as I wanted to invest in you. I mean, I don't I'm not trying to be difficult with you. I would have been happy to mentor you, but when you keep negotiating me down, I mean, I just like I I can't do it. You're going to be fine. Progressive. Best of luck. Congrats on your progress. Thank you. I'm disappointed, but when a door closes, another one opens and I just don't know what that drawer is if that's opening yet. You know, this is another no notch on my belt and we're going to keep going. I thought I offered you her a good deal. You did. It's such an important lesson, though. You cannot squeeze that last bit of blood out of the stone. When five sharks are out, one comes back in. You got one offer. It's not the time to negotiate. Read the room. ", "Fish Fixe": "first in the tank is an easier way to eat seafood [Music] hi sharks I'm Emily and I'm Melissa and we're two moms from Houston Texas that are making waves in the seafood industry we're here today asking for two hundred thousand dollars in exchange for 15 of our company fish fix so let's talk Seafood it's great for your brain your heart and your skin but did you know that only two in ten Americans are meeting the dietary recommendation for seafood consumption that means that 80 percent of Americans are not reeling in the benefits of seafood why is that it's because they're not confident buying it handling it or cooking it and that's where fish fix comes in fishfix delivers perfectly portioned premium Seafood to doorsteps Nationwide making seafood both simple and approachable we Source the absolute best seafood from around the globe individually portion it so it's easy to work with and then freeze in the freshness so the quality is consistent but we don't stop there the after delivery experience is what really sets us apart all of our packaging is geared towards your success in the kitchen like these bags they come with thaw prep and simple cooking instructions oh and that's not it they're also odor absorbent so once you're done prepping your fish simply take the prep trash put it back in the bag and toss no fishy smell Left Behind sharks this is quite the upper tuna tea so which one of you is ready to take the bait and get America their fish fix can we eat it yes please all right good job guys so yeah so you'll have you'll see that's our wild caught golf shrimp with a spicy cocktail sauce because I am from south Louisiana and I can't help myself with that oh it's a good sauce thank you next is our Maryland style crab cake with remoulade oh this sauce thank you after that we have our blackened salmon and then finally we have our American red Stamper and a Kevin O'Leary white wine sauce oh that's what was wrong with it very good sucking up very good thank you very good how did you guys start this like are you chefs are you no I've been in the seafood business um my entire career actually my husband and I started a live lobster wholesale distribution facility in Houston Texas and started serving seeing restaurants and Retail tell us how did that morph into this yeah so we met on a soccer field we played uh soccer and college together and after college I accepted a job working for one of the largest Wine and Spirits wholesalers distributors in the U.S so what's harder to sell the spirits or the fish you know what I would say it's just all about the storytelling and connecting great answer great answer are you exclusively subscription or can I buy anything on your website you can buy anything on our website and our subscriptions are just really set up for convenience you can pause cancel or anytime what does it cost and what is your cost walk me through it yeah so we're 100 direct to Consumer through our website the most popular box is 16 portions and you can purchase that for 139 or 149. what are your total sales so last year we did 821 000 in sales oh my gosh congratulations and did you make money off of that we made twenty thousand dollars you think you're breaking even because your customer acquisition costs are high what does it cost to acquire a customer our customer acquisition cost is uh between Thirty and forty dollars and then where are you looking what will you do this year we're at so we're at 494 year to date um and we we do believe that we're going to break a million and hoping to land right around one point just so we understand just from the very top how much does it cost you to manufacture that how much does it cost to deliver that so what's the total landed cost just so we can understand the margins yeah so our average order value is 143 from there our delivered cost is about 111 right now which we can't wait to talk about um because there's a reason behind that but um yeah that's where you are what is the reason behind it we're here today because we have a shipping issue we are we subsidize all of our packages to east and west coast because what happened was when the world shut down people in densely populated areas the east and west coast they needed product and our customer mix Grew From 75 local one-day ships to 50 percent east and west coast it's all shipping it's shipping so the shipping is actually 11 of our Revenue wow yeah it's hot and that is we do believe we're going to get that down to around what's the plan what's the plan we have a plan so we have a 3pl that can strategically get us to every single zone in one to two days which fits perfectly in our model but guys you have a fundamental problem right your primary costs are all variable you know Seafood right that protein there's variance in the cost and then the shipping it you know I think your prices will come down but they're always variable as well even in normal times that makes the business very tough and so for those Reasons I'm out let me ask what I think is the most important question which is of your existing customers how many are continuing to order two times three times four times five plus times 55 of our customers today have returned wow 70 of our total revenue is from our subscription business I love fish I'm a shark I'm a very big fish but over 13 years I've become a mini expert in lots of things but not shipping and Logistics I I can't help you there might be a bigger fish here that can uh I'm out thank you this fits into my chef Wonderful World okay and I and that's a very successful model and the only reason it's successful is it is our customer acquisition costs are very competitive I would get behind this as a third partner I want 33 and a third percent for 200 000 and I go to work with you on the social side I got to turn you into freaking stars and we are we're two division one Collegiate athletes like we got this I think your primary industry is moving fish and I think you can do that but you need to have a partner who understands that and so for that reason I'm out thank you so much thank you Lori what are you going to do I'll tell you I've been sitting here I've been listening you know I'm your customer I'm an advocate but I have to be authentic and I don't think that you need a partner to just help you get distribution centers and I really don't think that you need to give away Equity right I just think that you need a little bit of money which you could get somewhere else and not give away Equity so I want to be honest so for those Reasons I'm out thank you very much wow there's one fish left fish swim back to Mr Wonderful you have to decide I don't have any flexibility I want to have no flexibility no Melissa you can you can make a counter off yeah yeah yeah Kevin 25. no oh Kevin I'll do it for 30. okay you do it for 30. yeah annual fund POS for us to help us get this distribution I'm not going to commit to anything until I actually see your income and balance sheet statement but that's not your problem it's direct to Consumer customer acquisition cost that is the whole deal here we know that 80 of of consumer goods are bought by the moms right how do you How is how's your breakdown to your audience my chef business it's the majority of women oh my gosh you are great it's a great thing I mean there's women social media you should go online and look at Chef wonderful look at them Melissa are you going to give up 30 of the business you know this business foreign guys I never stand up for Kevin but I will here simply because you guys are floundering a little bit yeah you're floundering I'm not saying you're not capable there's a big difference right you're super smart but you're floundering financially right you're floundering a little bit on your distribution strategy and you're floundering on your marketing strategy but given your circumstances he's going to cover a lot of the issues you're getting money right which is really going to help you're going to get access to is is mailing list and his customer list and you're going to get some promotional elements and so if you know if you went out and just bought these independently they wouldn't be cheap Kevin 25 and we will we will be so efficient for you I know how much work this is and I know my value this is hard say yes to 30 and you have a new lease on life in this business I don't do failure okay we don't either all right so when I put my name on something there's no failure option that hurts my brand that's all I have to say on it 30 I'll do the deal I don't want you doing it for that I don't care what you want yeah I do I'll give you the 200 000 for 25 wow Lori you have a deal that's awesome that's why they call it the Shark Tank high five ladies [Music] we know Kevin would have been a great partner um but I think Lori really saw who we were and really believed in our company and you know I just think that this is going to be the best partnership for us Kevin didn't even see it coming I wouldn't have ever done it for Less so I congratulate Lori she is on a you know what happened you're agreed look there's Mr Wonderful and then there's Lori ", "Hidrent": "[Music] next up is a safe way to get tasks done around the house hi sharks my name is Dave heimbuck and I'm here from Dallas Texas I'm seeking $300,000 for 8% equity in my company wow sharks this is rose rose lives alone and sometimes needs help with projects around the house like moving heavy furniture or hanging a Priceless work of art and constant other tasks that always seem to pop up so what can she do who can she ask for help Rose has been burned before and she will only let someone into her home that she can trust sharks meet Daniel my hero Dan is clearly a firefighter and he happens to live in Rose's neighborhood he's a trusted member of their Community but that's not all he's also extremely handy oh yeah he's very strong and all firefighters will take care of your prized work of [Music] art How did Dan know that Rose needed help if only there was an easy way that is why I created hydrant Dan simply downloaded the hydrant Pro mobile app onto his phone and registered he soon received a notification from Rose that she needed help with the Home Project Dan was able to see the details of the work he quickly accepted the job and then he messaged Rose to schedule upon completion Dan entered the total number of hours that he worked this submitted an invoice for Rose to pay and for Dan to get paid all within the hydr platform sharks which one of you wants to sound the alarm to join our team and add some more fuel to this fire good job Dan Rose thank you so much for your help Mr Wonderful call me bye Rose so um I think this concept is really wonderful great idea what made you come up with this idea so I'm actually not a firefighter my background is actually in digital marketing and sales I worked for a lot of different startups there most notably was Shazam and I knew that someday if I had the right idea that I wanted to start my own company and then during this time I'm married into a family of firefighters and it was my brother-in-law he's a firefighter I was doing some home repair work on my house and I said hey I use this really cool app and I got a contractor over and he did this work and I was telling him about it he's like that's great Dave but I could do that you know everybody at the station does that and then my marketing mind started kicking in and with his help and the help of other firefighters I built it how long have you been in business and what have your sales been today yeah so we launched in 2018 lifetime sales $850,000 201925 2020 260,000 wow year to date $325,000 and what is your percentage of those gross sales so we take 23% we will charge the homeowner about $72 an hour we will pay the firefighter about $60 an hour what we found out right away was that the majority of our customers were senior citizens so we launched in Phoenix and Tampa and those are the markets that we're in now how does Rose find you Google Facebook and next door first of all I love this idea I love the idea of connecting amazing neighborhood Heroes like firefighters for everyday tasks thank you for advertising on the platform we're in 99% of American neighborhoods one of three households but I will tell you that part that you said you're responsible for which is getting people to come to the app and download it or go to the website and and try your product that is not trivial it took us 10 years to get to where we are today we have over 50 million registered users and we've never spent a dollar of advertising wow wow that's crazy really that's real magic on the internet you're building a Marketplace and you're operating in one of the most difficult sectors online which is local so he literally has to go neighborhood to Neighborhood the way we did with next door do you know how many neighborhoods there are in the United States no there are over 250,000 wow for you to do this and try to build a company on your own MH it feels a little rough it's hand toand combat you have to do it it one neighborhood at a time will take many years I don't know if I agree with we have to do it one neighborhood at a time um and the reason I say that is because there are fire stations everywhere right that not just in the big cities but also in the rural areas the middle of nowhere look I feel like you're a kindred spirit I admire so much about what you're doing but the truth is I have spent the last decade of my life building a company that's not so dissimilar from what you have in your hands I wish you all the luck but I've done my journey in neighborhoods for that reason I'm out thank you how do you open up more neighborhoods without a team I my computer buying ads on Facebook changing out the creative changing out the copy yes but why don't but why don't you get a few more people doing the same thing I would love to if I had some money to do that you want to try to control your own destiny yeah I just don't see a path to controlling your own destiny through digital ad spin so for those Reasons I'm out okay thanks for the timer it's a brilliant idea than the logo's great I don't know it's a contractor service okay I love everything but you got to get that in there look Dave I don't know if it's going to work or not but I think the way to go to market is senior citizens and women it is my wife would refer this to her friends right so listen I'll make you an offer okay great I'll give you the 300,000 but I want 20% okay thank you for that offer since I'm only going to be here once and Lori and Kevin haven't I'll help you make a decision here cuz I'm all about a return of capital I think the idea is brilliant I really dok you I really do but you're in a longer SLO here for me it's not the journey I want to take I'm out all right thank you K so you know me I have a very soft spot for firemen I know so I love it I would like to go in with Robert okay because I think I like okay I think the two of together um have different skill sets that can be complimentary and that can help you we need to change the name yes it needs to be intuitive but Robert for me to come in with you you are at 300,000 for 20% so we're going to need more than 20% it's just not enough it's just not enough for either of us I was thinking 300,000 for 35% for 35% you're allowed to counter Dave this industry is a $500 billion home home service industry oh don't go there it don't go there no no no don't go there is a lot of upside and I I appreciate that offer but that Equity at that valuation that's a million dollar valuation if you can get these guys to help you you got to price the risk I mean that's that's what our offer for the risk of not raising the money or counter Dave counter you don't have to be insulted with an offer like this that valuation is a little low would you guys accept back to your back to your offer 300 for 20% it's not enough for the two of us not enough for the two of us and I I have over million followers through all my social platforms I mean that alone is quite a lot of voices to hear about this Lori have a look at grandfather o he hates greed you have to compromise what made him what we were saying is you know what if we're just a third right so 300,000 for 33 and a 3% you literally cut his valuation 2/3 don't be greedy we're sticking at 300,000 for 33 and 1/3% you have a deal congratulations good job thank great great idea congratulations great job Dave congrats thank you all thank you he thank you very much take that with you oh my [Music] God e ", "Dude Wipes": "foreign hi sharks my name's Sean Riley and I'm here with my good friends Brian Meegan and Jeff kumkowski and we're the guys of dude products hailing from Chicago Illinois but you can just call us the dudes dude and we're here today seeking three hundred thousand dollars in exchange for 10 of our company sharks are you still wiping the old-fashioned way with just toilet paper if so you're a chump and your ass probably hates you for it but hey what's a dude to do you could try some baby wipes but we're not babies we're dudes so we created the award-winning dude wipes the very first wipes for well dudes they're flushable biodegradable have soothing aloe and the answer to every dude's prayers so sharks which one of you are ready to join in the crusade of saving the world one dude at a time [Music] Robert don't go up and try that there's a question for you dudes usually when I go anywhere there's already toilet paper there for me now I have to carry the dude wipe with me don't you get the difference no what's the difference what's the difference that's the compliment to toilet paper second to last white we're having a lot of fun with it let's get serious about the opportunity because you can prove us all wrong and our skepticism by telling us you have lots of sales because you put a valuation on this business of three million dollars if you don't have sales I'm gonna wipe your new what with this so year to date we have three hundred thousand dollars but we're projecting 1.5 million for this year because we just landed uh two to three million dollar contract to go Nationwide with Kroger wow what do you sell it for 649 Kroger will be selling that guy for we make about 40 margin in stores and 60 margin online so it's just 649 what is the baby wipes same package sell for I just want to do a comparison probably half the price for the same size guys look I like what you're doing I think you'll be successful um but I've got two problems I just don't see me as a wipes kind of guy I'm sorry second I think you're underestimating the amount of marketing dollars it's going to take to really open up a new category I don't think it's a ride that I can take so for those Reasons I'm out let me tell you what I think I haven't had my husband step foot in a toilet paper aisle since I married him men don't shop for toilet paper for the most part their wives do so I think you have to sell it to the wife I'm not sure they're going to buy in especially with the advanced knowledge that the price on these dude wipes are exactly double what they paid for the baby wipes so I wish you luck but they're not familiarma love you dudes I like what you're doing but you want three hundred thousand dollars for 10 why I mean basically two to three times your revenue and I understand we're very Revenue guys you know this you're the banker guy you're worth about a million bucks today you said 300 000 pre-tax about 230 000 after tax no one's going to pay more than five times for that no one's going to Value it even a multiple or an earnings multiple but you three dudes are going to run fast I want to come along and run two but the value I see is 300 000 for 25 percent I wasn't going to give you any more than that either that's my offer I'd give you 300 000 for 25 that's the right price given the challenges ahead it's a fair price actually dude he's trying to wipe you out unless Laurie let me share with you my thoughts from the female point of view I think the fact that you guys are cleaner dudes is quite appealing but um I feel I don't agree with the three million dollar valuation for that reason I'm out what do you guys want to do you have one decision to make and then once you've made it it's over I'll do it come on 300K 25 percent yeah I'm tired let's see what they're up to now we started dude products with our own investment and we didn't know if it would stay afloat or go down the drain before Shark Tank we're generating five thousand dollars per week today we're generating 1.4 million dollars per week our total gross sales was only three hundred thousand dollars dude products now has a total of 120 million dollars in sales today we're distributed over 15 000 retail stores nationwide including Walmart Kroger Target and Amazon you guys are taking on some Heavy Hitters and changing the game one of the reasons that dude wipes has become one of my better Investments is that they're literally taking a category toilet paper and Reinventing it and growing it and taking market share and that's not easy to do it really takes somebody who eats breathes and sleeps their business and that's exactly what they do with dude wipes working with a great organization called fight CRC who raises awareness in dollars for colorectal cancer we do monthly blogs to help raise awareness and provide them with products and monetary donations too we're currently the number two wipes brand in the U.S and as much as we love that number we definitely want to be number one and then the next step will be take dude products worldwide the golden ticket goes to my favorite product I've made you a good offer that's what I'm talking about that is the winner riding all the way to the bank you've come to the right place ", "Love & Pebble": "foreign next up is skin care taken to the next level [Music] hi sharks my name is Linda and I'm the Ellen love and I'm her husband Paul the pee and Pebble and we're here from Atlanta Georgia seeking 150 000 for 10 Equity of our company sharks what if I told you what we created was a game changer in the beauty industry are you ready for the best skincare hack don't worry Mr Wonderful we'll let you in on the best kept secret The Beauty Box it looks like a lollipop right but it's not for your mouth shark It's actually an ancient skincare remedy called Skin icing that's used to de-puff your face we've combined cryotherapy with a skin loving face mask to produce our cool Innovative one-of-a-kind Beauty pops it helps soothe your succulent skin and melts into a nourishing face mask that leaves you with a fresh wake me up glow our Pops are made from all natural superfoods rich in antioxidants to help tighten and brighten your skin to help experience that facial spa in the the comfort of your home all you have to do is pour a nutrient dense facial powder into our molds pour water and then stir until combined place the sticks over them and pop them in the freezer for four hours to set and when you're ready to get your facial on you take the beauty pops out of the freezer [Music] get ready to glow up just like she did so who wants to chill with the cool kids and make some cold Hard Cash what happens if I eat this it is edible wow now you're talking my kind of deal yeah yeah because it's got bananas aloe vera papaya and turmeric yes oh maybe not but basically this is a concoction of fruit Frozen right right and so it's the benefit just the fact that I'm putting something cold to my skin could I get that benefit with just water no I think the skin helps de-puff so you get the cryotherapy benefits and then you are left with a nourishing face mask so there's ice rollers on the market right so those it's a really popular skin tool there's face masks we're the first to combine the two I'm you come up with this idea I'm actually a pharmacist I did use some of my expertise to help kind of formulate this Linda does a lot of DIY stuff at home and one day I looked over and she was rubbing a frozen banana on her face and I was like what are you doing she's like no this really works so she had tried it on me and my skin was instantly soft and smooth and so we spent about a year and a half two years trying to formulate something that we could scale because you can't ship out a frozen banana well you have beautiful skin we didn't have very much growing up and we couldn't afford skin care so I would go into the kitchen and I would apply like honey and yogurt on my face because you know all girls want to feel beautiful and feel like a profession of that after you did it at home no I started my entrepreneurial Journey at 21 and I had a clothing boutique I met Paul and you're married we're married now yeah this whole company you know the whole story behind it is it's inspired by Penguins so penguins in the wild when they find the perfect Pebble right to give it to their mate and if she accepts it then you know they made for life and so this company 11 pill was actually my Pebble to her oh my God you guys are killing me there you go let's fall in love with the numbers okay yeah if you put a value on this business of 1.5 million dollars what are sales like so lifetime sales we're at 890 000 wow how many years is that we actually just launched this product in March in May we sold over a hundred thousand dollars in four days ah what happened on Tick Tock yeah it went viral yeah wow and I posted a video of my mom's before and after and people fell in love with her transformation yeah we had over 4 million views and the sales were coming in so yeah it was incredible Austin what do you sell it for so nine dollars and 20 cents landed and we sell it for 46 margin yeah have you financed the company today we've self-funded she sold her house sold your house yes how much is that that was a hundred thousand wow we're all in yeah so I get the social media hits I get the viral stuff but that doesn't happen forever have you done any digital spend yet have you actually bought social media yeah we do paid marketing what are your customer acquisition costs so I mean Blended we're at seven dollars and what's the margin on the lowest Base Kit 80 what are you looking for in getting a shark to invest today so we're really looking for a shark to help us navigate the retail space I think that this product would do really well be careful with all that it's really easy to get caught up you guys have got something that works for you social media right now is an unsung hero in selling products you should use it don't get caught up in just trying to search for sales everywhere look guys I have this great natural skin I don't need a lot of products it's just not a thing for maintenance nah come on it's not a great fit for me so for those Reasons I'm out yeah thank you so much guys uh this just isn't for me as a product I'm sorry I'm out Paul and Linda I think it's very well executed I thought about it because I I like you guys a ton and I like your product but it's just I don't have any expertise in this place so I'm I'm sorry I'm out so yeah I just wanted to say we're working on a patent right now so you know there's something special here and I what's the patent pending I'm freezing fruit into a pot freezing and melting into a mask it's a growing Market we would love to have you on board I'm just in love with both of you and as much as I adore you guys I gotta say this though I have to be um we have a meeting with you go with what I think is true and I think that you should grow slow so that you don't make the one big mistake that happens to entrepreneurs which sometimes can be exploding too much and having too much inventory before you have the sales I think you're on the right path it's not the right product for me so I love you but I'm gonna go out Paul and Linda it's not all over yet Barbara um I wonder if the social media success you have is a one-hit wonder because it's responsible for the great majority of your sales and that concerns me I mistrust the retail space something about a young entrepreneur when they think retail they don't think about slotting fees they don't think about return products so much goes wrong and that's that's the kind of like guidance we need so yeah so I'm I'm thinking I mean this is a rough one Barbara please my Beauty Pop is melting I think a wonderful business that you created but I don't think it's a business for an investor I'm at I'm sorry for that though I really wanted to find my way hey is everyone out good luck guys all the best thank you good luck guys thank you bye and keep working and keep working and I know one day we're gonna succeed we've already started seeing this year and you know we've seen this growth and we're just going to keep going", "Pink Picasso": "next up is an elevated version of a well-known craft [Music] [Music] hi sharks my name is ashley selfies hi sharks my name is brittany selfies so we are not only business partners but we are also a wife team today we are asking for four hundred thousand dollars in exchange for five percent of our business pink picasso each pink picasso kit comes with a high quality canvas with a template for you to paint as well as the paint and brushes you need to create your own masterpiece all of that is packed into a giftable tube that shows what your image can look like as well as estimated time it'll take to complete it and when you're finished you can hang your painting on the wall and you can be so proud of what you did we believe we've created a truly modern day craft one that you can work at your own pace making it a relaxing and enjoyable hobby so don't you think it's just super neat that anybody can be an artist so sharks who's ready to create your own masterpiece with pink picasso let's go yeah yeah so these are beautiful these are are these painted from this yes it's like she said every single thing you need comes in the tube and most of these images are my own photography and so we turned them into a kit and you just basically sit down and paint it's just paint by numbers right right so what we found is everybody needs self-care this is something that anybody can do everybody loves puzzles right but it requires you to keep it out all the time and so this you can roll it up once it's dry i mean don't roll it up wet right but once it's dry you can roll it up and put it back in the tube until the next time you're ready to paint how did the two of you meet funny story about three and a half years ago our life looked completely different we were married to our husbands that we had been with for over a decade and we were just best friends doing life together and then one day our feelings just evolved and we blew up our lives it was not glamorous at all when we did that i mean when you blow up your lives you're we were both basically stay-at-home moms and we had no money so we were in two apartments with three children saying okay our kids are used to that american middle class life what are we gonna do and you know when you hit rock bottom you get scrappy and you get brave and you don't have time to worry about that because you have kids to take care of and so she literally sat in the apartment and was staring at the wall saying what can we do to provide for our children and create the life that we want to have why didn't you think of this she actually was sitting there looking at the wall and she said what skills do i have photography and manufacturing were her background like that was the biggest thing i was like what can we package beautifully and go into market and just own it so up until last summer ashley and i did everything from start to finish i made labels and then we would go downstairs at night we packed boxes all the kids were helping including our little one passing tubes what a life lesson for your kids and y'all they are such good workers why don't you ban them from going to college and keep in the basement i know we really enjoy their company if i'm being super honest we want them to know that you have to work really well and the family that works together stays together so there's got to be a lot of these out there there's nothing proprietary about what you're doing my question really goes to the four hundred thousand or five percent imputes an eight million dollar valuation yipiya yokai yay you must have a ton of sales we do so we um started in 2019 we went to market having spent 1500 on product and sold out repeatedly so our first year we won oprah's favorite things and so we did a lucky break so we did 1.3 million in our first year wow what about 2020 2020 was 3.3.5 million yeah wow wow what does it cost to make and what do you sell it for for our 16 by 20 adults the costs are 3.77 to make and it's four dollars to land it it wholesales for 19 but resales for 42. oh wow there's a ton of margins yeah yeah yeah these guys cost you four dollars with you yes yes that's insane you should be ashamed of yourself 2021 what were your revenues today so 1.4 we think we're going to end up the year over 5 million over 500 million in gross revenues gross revenue so at 5 million what are your net margins like your profit margins after everything last year we brought home around 900 000. i mean basically you're extremely profitable right you have incredible margins so i'm curious what do you need from a shark we need a mentor i feel like i don't know anything about here forward like we need a bigger bat i have a bucket list retailer that i'd like to be in and they've said no are you in michael's no we are not why not it's really hard when it's just the two of us like i've never done anything big box i've only done these boutiques like we're in over 2100 boutiques right i know how to do that but we don't know how to do so you need a shark to call michaels well right i know michael i also want licensing i want to be in disney world you want to license disney so you want someone to make calls to set up the disney licensing let me give you a point love pop greeting cards like you guys stood here with nothing when they showed up in shark tank now they have the star wars license they have the disney license they got every license they want they got the beatles you want to get there right all right here's the deal for you i'll make you an offer the four hundred thousand dollars i want to be a one-third partner oh 33 and a third percent i want to share in the distributions because i'm not a control guy so we're partners together we decide how much capital goes into the business how much we distribute to ourselves you got to feed your kids okay this is a really interesting business listen you two are amazing just my cup of tea you are dynamos so i love the look of it i think it's beautiful and i think we're in an age where people are trying to get away from the phone and spend time doing things that are creative that have to do with improving your mind in a different way so i think you are spot on and that's why you have done so well besides who you are and the drive of what lawyers are an offer in there so um daniel saw all of that potential in you too and he said why don't we do this together if you're interested in two super sharks that are very complementary we do them for 400 000 for 20 to the company well i wanted to just give you some feedback and then address the subject of an offer i remember distinctly when i was building my business at the point you were out right now i was doing very well very quickly and i remember thinking wow do i need help and i almost brought in a financial partner and sold half my business because i realized it was beyond me and my knowledge base as to how i could grow and compete with the big guys so i thought i needed a big guy in thank god i didn't take in the big guy thank god he would have had me for breakfast all right so i don't think you need a shark it's not and no big science why are you in charge by the way wait excuse me no big deal getting into any store you want you simply make a wish list and then hiring the right people to help you execute it all right but i just want to caution you before you jump into bed with a lot of sharks think about what you really need you've got all the knowledge base you just need more help so are you interested every advice is worth every penny you're paying for with all due respect i don't agree with what barbara's saying people ask me what is coming out of kovid what is happening and what is happening is an influx of people wanting to start their own businesses so you have a beautiful idea you're super successful and now what you've got to do is race faster because other people are gonna be on your tail now the good news is here you have two offers i gotta say one more thing right don't sell yourself short so i'm not i'm not here to make you an offer because i'm not as good a fit even as those two honestly but at the same time don't sell yourself short because you are crushing it what you have is a very very valuable business you have convinced everybody here and everybody in america that you have built one heck of a business yeah but you got to make a decision you got two offers what do you want to do i'm going to come back in [Music] i'm going to give you a 400 000 loan for just five percent of the business owners who pay me percent in interest because i think you're underselling yourself i'm going to help you structure your company and convince you in one week flat you don't need help i want to ask them britain i want you to understand before i approach lori about partnering with me i was going to give you four hundred thousand dollars for ten percent i don't wanna uh roll under the bus or whatever thing and cut it off i sincerely think that her and i for 20 will help you more than me for ten percent but i really love your business that she and i together are worth the 20 time to make a decision okay one last twist just because i want to screw around there no more twists no no no i i want to modify my offer to this i will do it for three percent equity with a straight royalty of six dollars a kid oh my god i mean think about that because that make you can afford it your margins are crazy barbs is the better deal no you or no deal at all you want to know something the only deal that's right okay let's make it one thing you feel in the gut is right you got to make your call you want to do you got to decide any of them can help you [Music] would you guys be willing to do 15 for the two of them for the two of them yeah [Music] you got a deal thank you all pleasure thank you very much you guys are amazing you are just the kind of women i love thank you [Music] oh my god who knew i just want to show our kids what harvard looks like and that you can do it despite what anybody says you can do you ", "Sheets Laundry Club": "first in the tank is an environmentally minded innovation in laundry care [Music] hello sharks I'm Chris and I'm also Chris we're the founders of sheets laundry Club from Mooresville North Carolina and we're seeking 500 000 for five percent of our company sharks in my 20 years in the U.S army flying helicopters I was able to get a bird's eye view of the world's plastic crisis I was shocked by the way other countries were disposing of plastic sharks the plastic crisis spans across our cities landfills and our oceans and surprisingly one of the biggest culprits is the laundry industry and so we decided to take matters into our own hands and we started sheets laundry Club to combat the plastic crisis we did that by developing a patented eco-friendly dehydrated sheet of laundry detergent it's lightweight it's mess free it's easy to use and best of all it's 100 plastic free from start to finish you very simply take one sheet of detergent and you toss it in with your dirty laundry at the end of a wash cycle leaves your laundry soft fresh and clean every time it's more convenient than liquids and powders it's more cost effective to ship and it is far better for our planet than mainstream alternatives sharks it's obvious we care about the planet so which one of you wants to get hooked on creating a plastic free tomorrow so in front of you you got a glass bottle yep and a detergent you go ahead and pick up that glass bottle take off the lid you can set that down grab the detergent sheet and then roll it that's really good enough thank you tight enough to fit inside that bottle now pick up the bottle and go ahead and drop it inside and notice that the water is cold and as soon as it hits the cold water it begins to dissolve now once you've done that go ahead grab your lid and we're going to shake it for a few seconds abracadabra bubble into great bubbles what are the contents of the Sheep the primary ingredients in the laundry sheet that we use for cleaning it's a sodium oral sulfate surfactant it's derived from coconut oil it's a natural stuff that they put in shampoo it's found in shampoos and the enzymes in it are plant-based as well we're also not using a laundry list of synthetic chemicals that are found in mainstream detergent wait wait what do you guys do what's your role what's your background it's like you guys standing here you flew a helicopter I find a big jump like yeah what happened in between how did you come up with the idea and what role do each of you play in the business operations absolutely so I am the CEO of sheets laundry Club when I was 18 I joined the army as a military police officer my first 12 months or so in the Army I got an opportunity to fly in the back of a Blackhawk that was a game changer for me shortly after my 25th birthday I graduated flight school became a Blackhawk pilot achieved a dream that I wanted to do in 14 years around the world flying helicopters but my lungs are really bad and the lungs got destroyed over in Iraq in 2007 and 2008 and that's kind of where my plastic Journey started it was a war-torn country they didn't have any type of Trash Service established so they were burning it and everything obviously Rises to the skies and I spent every single day of the week for the most part flying in those guys that had the toxins wow so about six to 12 months after coming back from Iraq I had a lot of wheezing and coughing issues I went to a pulmonologist and found out that my lungs were now that of a 70 year old I think I was about 33 at the time so I've been on medication for my lungs my wife and I we decided to you know rid plastic from our home I learned a lot about it I learned that you know nine percent of plastic worldwide is recycled and 12 percent of its burned and the other 79 percent wind up in landfills and oceans so in 2018 I met Chris and I was actively searching for my next Endeavor because I had 15 years of starting businesses at that point but none of them really had a big purpose and so I was at a point in my life got a family now like I want to start something that has a purpose okay guys yes so what's in the what's in there so we have about 46 different skus within our system it's about 30 different products the varieties are based so it's not just the sheets it's all this yeah absolutely the main focus has always been the laundry sheets we have floor cleaning sheets we have scent boosters the mission all your product Club is to remove plastic from when were you guys launched we launched it officially launched to the public in January of 2020. and what were your sales in 2020. in 2020 we did 2.046 million in total sales wow so 2.04 sounds pretty impressive what percentage is your number one item yeah laundry sheets are our number one selling item they are out of those two million dollars how much did you selling those sheets we sold about 1.2 million we also signed an exclusivity agreement with Kimberly Clark Kimberly Clark owned the patent on the dissolvable laundry detergent sheet do you pay them a royalty we do pay a royalty wait a minute so you have it that you are the only ones that can also use the patent are there limitations on that as long as we pay our royalties annually that patent is exclusive to us so guys the con is I don't think you own anything and you've never answered yet how long your agreement lasts with the large consumer for October of 2024. 20 that's it then what happens you have an option to renew it expires so I have three concerns yes one you have a patent that expires secondly you have 46 cues I see that as a formula for disaster it's like having too many children when one kid's you good kid and you have to give everybody attention so object to that but thirdly even without the first two you're not persuasive I'm sorry for whatever reason forgive me for saying this I don't think either of you sell you could have the best product the best production you could run the best company make people happy but if you don't have that aggressiveness hunger on the front end of your business it doesn't really go anywhere so for that reason sadly I'm out so I just followed both of you the worst salesman she's ever seen on Shark Tank yeah we're on track to almost seven million dollars in in sales this year a net profit margin of 24 okay so you're going from 2 million to 7 million in one calendar a year that is correct why do you think you hit that because Barb says you can't sell yeah we built it off of aggressive advertising campaigns and we got user generated content right off the bat of customers talking about our products how much they loved it so quick videos absolutely adding in testimonials what were you running them Instagram Facebook yeah social platforms we uh we just recently rolled out some campaigns on Pinterest we run AdWords so I'm not a pound of pavement sales guy I'm a marketing guy I'm an Ecom guy all right guys look I don't think you have to be embarrassed at all about salesmanship you're blowing it out of the water on Revenue but I have a deal called Blue land which also crystallizes cleaning fluids quite frankly I'm competing with you I'm going after the same customer I can't compete with myself guys I'm out so I like the product and I think the mission's super important I'm super worried about our oceans I'm worried about our planet but you came in 500 000 for five percent it just doesn't excite me half a million dollars is a lot of money and I want to be able to wake up and feel like I'm going to reap the benefits of what I sow this isn't for me I'm out so five hundred thousand dollars what's the point what is it that you really need to do and don't just tell me you need a shark we want to expand globally we want to take this overseas we want to make a difference that's expensive one of the biggest things I try to teach by entrepreneurs is conserve your cash you know what this just doesn't work for me so for that reason [Music] so you're saying you have traction for seven million dollars this year what degree of confidence you have that because if it's true your valuation is surprisingly reasonable we've got over 21 000 monthly subscribers so the recurring revenue for the years are going to be close to three million dollars alone we're working with the cpg group and hopefully in April uh we'll be in Target history historically agree with Barbara's sense about people need to have greed and hunger persuaded that you don't need to maybe like Barbara and I used to go to the streets and knock on every door if you know how to do it with your digital savviness I will give you five hundred thousand dollars per 10 of the company [Music] I'm extremely grateful for the offer and we came in with our ceiling being at eight percent we we would do 500 000 for eight percent can we meet there how about five hundred thousand four percent and two percent in advisory shares so 500 000 for 10 yes there are so many other things that we haven't even covered yet so do you want to build this deal or not we take just 10 seconds to talk oops all right decision made we'll do it thank you I appreciate it thank you Daniel thank you so much congratulations guys well done thank you very much Daniel's story is inspirational just to get somebody that's in the sustainable space for us is huge so I know his knowledge is going to help us grow and just eliminate plastic worldwide so much faster ", "Zach & Zoe Sweet Bee Farm": "[Music] R girl whiskey going to E's my mind Beach Town dress on the drying L do I remind you of your daddy in his

before take a look could a man starts with a storybook at the end of the story they get a cool band to wear and earn kudos for good listening that's a lot of money for something that isn't making any money yet our margins are huge though our evaluation is fair I just think it's a little too early I can't go down the path with you I'm out you're doing better than most adults to pitch here they're gonna regret this they're definitely gonna regret this don't worry we're still your biggest fans it's our Dream to get a deal so we're back seeking ninety thousand dollars for five percent of our ornament saving business sharks we all know ornaments are fragile and even just bumping into the tree can make your ornaments fall and break not to mention if you have dogs or cats flimsy Hooks and simple ribbons just don't work they only drape over a branch waiting for accidents to happen it's about time this Changed by actually anchoring ornaments to the branch ornament anchor keeps your memory safe and secure this is an ornament that Ayan made when he was two years old I'd be really upset if it broke to secure it I simply take ornament anchor and I put it through the hole then I pull it up and over I find a branch [Music] put it on and pull that's it with ornament anchor you'll never have to worry about another precious memory being broken on the floor arm and anchor can hold up to 10 pounds so you feel confident your ornaments are secure and you'll never have to worry about pets knocking off your ornaments again now it's time to put ornament anchor to the ultimate test goggles everyone that's including you sharks laughs [Music] our most precious ornaments are right here on this tree so the stakes are high okay Lori when I say go can you press that bright red button

unwrap those uh special ornaments we made you you know you can shake them around on their Branch because we are sure that they won't come off [Music] the family of entrepreneurs yeah what happened to the last one that made you get into this one well sharks Cuda bands was one of the you know the most important things in our lives and it certainly got us here you know I'll take it to a baseball analogy sometimes you have you know singles and doubles but we're really here today with ornament anchor and we know it's going to hit a home run but last time the problem you had was your valuation was insane well did you learn anything from that last um yes yes sharks we did and our valuation is awesome this time how did you come up with this and was it a family well I came up with ornament anchor when I was in fourth grade from a school project I was just sitting around my Christmas tree trying to come up with an invention and I thought to myself every year we break two to three ornaments and I thought there has to be a solution so I created a prototype and when I went to the school Fair everyone swarmed my booth asking they could buy some all the grandmas moms kids everyone loved it okay now last time you were here the problem was valuation we've established that today it's ninety thousand five percent one point eight million dollar value Bingo why is this product worth 1.8 million dollars so the first thing I'll run you through sales our first year during the pandemic we made three hundred and twelve thousand dollars in sales and this June in a summer month sharks this is a Christmas product we made eighty thousand dollars in sales which brings our lifetime total in just 18 short months to over half a million dollars in sales good for you but you know there's a big difference between sales and profits yes sir we do you are going to love our profit margins Mark landed a pack of 24 ornament anchors cost us one dollar and fifty cents to make and we sell at MSRP for 24.99 wow means our director consumer profit margins are 94 and our wholesale profit margins are selling what's the percentage of yourself 24.95 is our MSRP so it's almost like this could be more expensive than the ornament I put on my tree each one of these yes Barbara but believe it or not we've we did a really big survey of all of our customers and all of our customers said it was at a perfect price point for them because they were saving you know memories they were saving their ornaments I mean people are willing to also put in the investment it's an insurance policy for your greatest memories mom and dad are you working on the business or you you got your day jobs as well so since this is such a success I'm full time in it in terms of finding the buyers and then the two are pitching and closing they close Target they close are you running it I'm I'm running operations for filling orders making sure that everything is going smoothly in terms of customer service and you have no other job you know we come from a really long line of entrepreneurs we have other businesses that we run and you do you mind me asking full-time the other businesses still have Kudo bands um so Kudo bands is still running today still doing great and we had another uh Venture that we you know hopped into during the pandemic we decided we wanted to be a gaming family so we put something up and we we started selling games yeah so card game we do that as well so we you know we're we're entrepreneurs all the time sharks this is the most power pack team you're going to get ever on this show you know what guys I love you guys this is not not the most power pack team we're going to get there's a lot of moving Parts the business I think you guys are in is getting on TV and selling right there's nothing wrong with that you know it's that's a good business solution but you've got three different companies right at least yeah guys it's just there's too many movies there's too many moving Park swimouts thank you thank you Mark for your time guys I look at this as a fantastic product huge margins but also this is an extremely seasonal product and you know I look at my portfolio of companies I don't do seasonal products because I want to sell stuff all year long I'm sorry guys I mean you're terrific you come out here and you pitch hard it's great but this is not a deal for me I'm out thank you Kevin for your time but hey guys this business is not for me I'm out okay thank you Damon for your time I have to say you guys are incredibly impressive your passion is intense um I do believe that you could sell anything I know the product works and it's good but I don't think it's investable for me as it's a one-off item that does one function that is seasonal sadly it's just not broad enough for me and so sorry I wish you good luck but I'm out thank you Lori for your time but we actually have one shark left the Grinch Barbara hey I'll tell you what I loved about uh the entire scene I love the confidence of your children thank you thank you so much that means the most but I'm actually shocked people are paying 25 bucks times two for a tree fifty dollars I have a lot of money I wouldn't pay 50 I would just rather lose a few ornaments but my biggest concern is the hopping from business to business I really like someone who has an idea sticks with it through hella high water we're laser focused on ornament it's the only thing that we've been in the moment I think you're laser focused on ornaments but I think maybe this time next year it might be something else so because of my mistrust of that even though I adore you a man to use a baseball analogy you've gone down swinging we'll give you credit for that good luck guys good job guys good luck [Music] we wish a shark could have been along with us on the ride but we know for a fact that ornament anchor is going to be a big name it's going to be in every single Christmas tree in America and worldwide and this is the most power pack team you are going to get the Sharks missed out ", "Santa's Enchanted Mailbox": "next up is a way to bring magic to the holidays [Music] hi sharks I'm Chris searey and I'm Lisa Siri and we're from Wallingford Connecticut and we are the founders of Santa's Enchanted mailbox here today seeking an investment of a hundred and fifty thousand dollars in exchange for 30

look at some of the excitement from children around the world [Music] so sharks which one of you wants a spot on Santa's nice list come join our family in spreading Christmas joy around the world how did you even come up with this idea this is a family business my wife and I we've been married 12 years yesterday yeah okay congratulations congratulations very much um when our oldest who's now 10 was three years old we used to put out this cardboard decorative flimsy mailbox as a decoration and we said wouldn't it be cool if we could bring real magic right in front of them not something left to the imagination so my stepfather-in-law is a retired engineer he helped create the Prototype then we secured two granted utility patents we traded and then what again how do we go about bringing this to the masses so we decided to take a licensing route Lisa and I started writing anybody that wanted to hear our story I pitched to anybody who would take a meeting with me to learn more about the product and we found a wholesale Christmas based company and signed a three-year licensing agreement our licensing agreement just came to an end this is our first year out on our own and here we are here we are today how much do they sell so our first year we did a hundred and twenty thousand dollars in sales our second year we were pretty Blown Away a big box retailer placed an order for 1.7 million dollars whoa and in our third year 2020 a lot of obstacles happen uh on a personal note so my wife owns a hair salon with kovid we were forced to shut down and the schools were forced to shut down so uh overnight we became a single income family and so not having my income pitching into our home life we decided to go a little bit more conservative on spend and that kind of changed our route of where we were going with the mailbox it did sell through at the big box retailer we were told it underperformed to their expectations at the same time they dropped the price and then they did start to sell how much did you make off of the licensing agreement like what percentage in our first year we did four percent until we owned the cost of the mold in the second year it went up to 6 percent and remained at six percent in our third year and did they manufacture this or they did so we're actually currently utilizing their manufacturers still but we're paying a markup that comes with that you're buying direct to the factory but you're going to have to pay a markup on that we're paying a markup to our former licensing partner to utilize the manufacturer so you're using their Factory overseas but they made you pay for the molds what are the molds cost we don't know the exact total but it was close to 15 to 30 000 we had two different modes made wow now and this is a lesson about life this is a huge lesson are you hearing that Kevin it's a huge actually I wouldn't have done it that way licensing is okay but it's a huge lesson on the deal that you did yeah right this was brand new to us and maybe there were some things that we still scratch our head about well I mean listen don't ever feel bad the to me the best lessons in life are your mistakes so let's talk about the cost of this sure how much does it cost to make so what do you sell it yeah right now they're at 17.25 all in to get them here to the states we're selling them for 49.99 our website we know that we have to drive down the cost of manufacturing you said they brought the price down and started to perform I believe you said that correct correct um yeah what was the magic price point that they started to perform at 20 24.99 24.90 24.99 yeah you're bringing it in right now with 17. correct this mailbox is a it's a it's a decorative mailbox and people are walking past it we had no way to get the story out what it does and it was no marketing budget behind it so we're really looking for strategic partners that can help Market this I don't like seasonality in retail I see this as a challenge just to go direct to Consumer it works there's magic I get it but this was not for me I'm out guys I'm kind of in the same boat I mean there's a lot of complexities for a simple business your relationship with your former licensee your manufacturing relationship particularly trying to get something done for this Christmas right yeah so I mean that's just uh a lot that's a big hill to climb so for those Reasons I'm out all right thank you thank you I think my challenge is that um you got to hit that price down to put it in retail and this is a product that has to be demonstrable and it's very hard it doesn't have what we call Hanger appeal because you don't even realize all the great things it does when you're walking by so that means you have to be converting heavy on social media and online and I don't see it there just yet um somehow all right thank you very much I have five seasonal businesses in the last three or four years and what's interesting to me is those entrepreneurs I believe work harder than any of my other entrepreneurs because I have to push in a very short window but I think your price is way too high and yet you smart people you're so dedicated I think you're gonna find something else to do okay I don't think this thing is going to fly I'm out but wait but wait and clean if plastic is still here yeah we came here today wanting to walk out of here with a deal with the right partner I mean we'd be willing to move the equity to where it's beneficial for the amount of work that we need first of all I think it's cute as can be I really do and I think kids will love it it's just spot on to me so I think the product is a hero my problem here is I do think it's too high and it sounds like what's going on with the factory that's really difficult once you don't have control of it very hard yes the other thing that I worry about with this is what you could get that down to yeah if you had told me what this could cost what we could do with it that would have turned it for me yeah no I understand yeah and so unfortunately because I don't know I have to be out ", "Wendy's Gnome Shop": "hey sharks first of all I need to say thank you

dollars and what do you sell it for 26.99 and how much do you have invested in it because I know you had to create a mold and everything else eight molds yeah so we have about 200 and 224 thousand dollars for our own money in it wow that was a big learning a thing for us I'm shocked actually at the price I have to be honest yeah that's crazy yeah you got a banana in the tailpipe on that one so I give you 250 000 sure what happens next sure the money will go towards inventory and paid marketing so we can really supercharge and put gasoline into our Market never have to do any paid marketing at all on this thing you're not going to take this to retail all right correct it's a very visual demonstration sure it needs to be demonstrated online it needs to go viral and people have to buy it from your site I like it but the only way this works for me and I'll be the first to tell you is this is a royalty deal that's what it is I'll give you the 250 000 and your margins are good enough to pay me back three bucks a unit that's how I get my money back no equity you own it my interests are aligned in using my social media to blow it up and say look this is a chef wonderful exclusive I'll sell a ton of these for you three bucks a unit yeah three bucks a unit you are being greedy I don't think so Kevin when does the royalty stop it never never well how do I make money Robert how do I make money how do they make money if you're they're always paying a royalty they get the rest I mean look it's an offer you can decide yeah thank you for the offer uh I I buy this type of stuff every day and my wife takes it as soon as I open it up she goes out to the backyard and she puts it in the garbage and I I do like it a lot but this is one of those things you'll do with the kids once in a while and then it's going to sit up there with all the Tupperware it's not gonna work for me I'm out thank you Damon you're so early and it's just not a business that I think is investable for me right now so I'm sorry I'm out thank you Lauren I love gadgets I buy these things all the time look come play flyer I love you guys I I really think your real entrepreneurial I actually don't know if

equity in case somebody buys the product or some other blog thank you very much for your offer and believing in us really appreciate it what have you done in social media we have limited funds um

right we're here not just for the money we need the star power behind it giving us a little bit of an edge and a little bit of an endorsement is more important to us than the money because you know if you need star power I I think you need yeah definitely do yeah no I'm not dealing with that approach you never get your Capital back you'll be buying more and more and more inventory forever you really think you need star power to drive this thing it's it's not a silver bullet right it's going to be a healthy execution on our side driving costs down getting some funds for inventory and some

for 10 of my company liberate sharks are you ready for the best workout of your life well today I'm going to have you working out muscles you forgot existed just one second let me get my equipment out [Music] perfect oh did you think we were working on our physical fitness today no sharks today we're working out our mental muscles liberate is the first mental Fitness Studio our method Blends mindful movement with journaling conversation and meditation for a dynamic workout for your mind our classes and courses Empower individuals and teams to build skills like courage gratitude and resilience to strengthen Collective well-being sharks it doesn't take heavy lifting to know that we're on to something here so who wants to put your money where your mind is and join our mental Fitness movement so Liv are you starting a cult or something no not and how the hell do I make money with any of this crap do I go somewhere I live because like you have a studio online classes hosted over zoom in May 2020. so live were these instructor-led classes yes so Bridge per class okay and what what do you charge so a subscription for our on-demand library is 19 a month and the subscription model for and the On Demand is 49 a month and how many subscribers do you have so I I want to open up the picture a little bit because the main source of our revenue is our B2B model in 2021 we realized businesses and teams need a lot of help too teams are really disconnected they're remote they're struggling to connect on a human level so 65 of our business now is through our corporate partnership let me ask what's your total sales total sales is 50 000 lifetime live I don't think anybody here is going to challenge your premise I'm on board 100 what I'm struggling with how is this business worth two million dollars today our margins are over 90 percent we have 178 quarter over quarter growth rate we're 10 exiting the business in the first year and we've built a highly scalable system team and curriculum you only have 50 000 in sales lifetime so far I love the optimism how much did you do last month 7 500 last month and we're projecting doing 8 500 this month and we have a sixty nine hundred dollar deal with a corporate partner that's closing distance you're not getting scale live like yeah seriously I love I love everything about what you're doing but there are big companies doing similar stuff and they're charging us fifty a hundred thousand dollars why aren't you getting that scale is it because you don't stand the B2B Market or the consumer Market isn't working for you why isn't there more our corporate program is only six months old and we also with investment to hire a sales manager to help really invest in scaling it's still hard I think his point though is pricing more than anything else I can raise the prices yeah and you might have to I mean look I believe in mental Clarity the Dallas Mavericks have had a full-time you know team psychologist because if you can't perform mentally you can't perform physically the challenge is how do you scale to Robert's point and I learned this a long time ago sell at a premium don't sell out of desperation right because selling five thousand dollar deals is no easier than selling fifty or a hundred thousand dollar deals yeah you've got to get to that point where you have enough confidence because it's you're right on you're on Trend you're on need you're on value but you're underpricing yourself and because of that it's really impossible for an investor to come in because it's really impossible to scale with where you're at so for those reasons amount well I'd like to talk to another point of how scale let me just pick up on that because I I know that you're following a similar Trend though well you're very early in your journey you're you're it's a good time to join it is a good time to join it's not a good time to join at a two million valuation I love what you're doing we are like to be the soul cycle of mindfulness we're licensing out our curriculum we have a hundred variations of proprietary curriculum that can be licensed out to every Fitness and Studio every Fitness maybe but you haven't done any of those things today to show me a tangible return it's an early stage so flexible it is unbelievably important to me to partner with a shark that is my goal I am so hard working and driven I I can't leave this carpet without a deal it's my purpose on Earth is to build liberate I would love to have your support on that journey I just think you need to go through a journey to learn more before I can come with you I'm out well my thought is that uh I love what you're doing we all know that the mind is the largest muscle on the body and as soon as that thing expands it never shrinks never goes back but you haven't figured it out yet a little too early I love what you're doing but I'm out thank you Kevin Glory live um [Music] every day you have a wellness portfolio that's ripe and perfect you're right and you know you've done your homework you're wonderful you have energy and you have grit any deal on the planet I I know I know you are I know you are the right now you are at a stage where you're figuring out what you're doing this is where you you invest in the entrepreneur and then the idea grows like a tree you don't have it realized fully enough yet for me and for that I'm out thank you Lori royalties oh wow wow good for you this idea is without marriage it's going to zero you will never make any money oh God you will never get an investor take it behind the barn and shoot it and do something else thank you Kevin good luck Liv congratulations you have to go now do I leave [Music] believing in what I was doing in my evaluation and I think I could have valued it lower and I get a shark on board but honestly I think it's going to be a billion dollar company so I'm happy I stuck to my guns and no sense in regrets ",

and that's uh that's level 12 which is about 45 pounds right there oh my God oh my God I gotta tell you that's incredible that you do it all from that yes what I'd like to understand is when you talk about a company that's worth 20 million dollars 500 000 for 2.5 20 million valuation I know and respect that you're going to have sales and lots of users when did you start it how much did you sell when you started and how have you been going on the year-over-year basically sure overall product development have been over five years but we first started shipping product in July of last year oh really okay just July what did you do last year in sales four million in sales what wow what have you done so far this year over 8 million wow wow wow okay but I don't like resistance bands because I don't want to have to go over the door and connect it to the door and then close the door and it's just like a hassle but what if I want to do other exercises thank you very much for helping out Max Pro is literally the most versatile thing you've ever seen you can use it on a door you can use it like he's doing right there we it's in your kit right there yes and it's a strap it's a single strap that goes around and they're specially engineered we have a wall track which does all the flies that you're talking about you see her working out in a tree working out a fence how did you come up with this and and what is your background my primarily background is Automotive 25 years in automotive so for me um Global project management supply chain engineer yes I am an engineer yes mechanical yes I was traveling a lot I was overseas I kept missing German workouts and it was just trying to figure out how to get resistance on the road what does it cost to make it what does it cost to sell it and then I believe you have an app so retail value is 8.49. 149 849 and I got a preface yes are these hours to keep yes so 849 dollars and what does it cost you to make it 205 Landing costs 20 total between Pick and Pack and shipping and you sell direct to Consumer only yeah um 97 of our sales that's pretty well everything that's our higher are you selling eight million dollars of this covet everybody sold yes that's exactly right and we do a ton of money on marketing so what are you burning per month our essential Burns about a hundred thousand per month oh could you become profitable if you slowed down your marketing we make money on every one of these days the cash flow positive is a yes and a no because we take it it's one of the other no no I mean yes we are but then we take that money no look we get it look I understand the business right this is a grinded out competitive business we have over 3 000 daily users right now on our app last year you did four million dollars from July to December yes how much did you make on that four million uh just over fifty thousand dollars this year you're gonna sell eight million right are you going to make money or lose no this year we're probably gonna reach over 12 million in sales and what will you make on that or will you lose money um we'll probably be close to breaking it but right now you're burning money is what you're saying yeah look there's nothing wrong with it okay I know we get all caught up in profits but if you're going to scale a business right you got to invest to grow you know Mark you're right um You need to fund the growth okay we took a revenue based um line of credit and so if someone lent you money and for every dollar that you bring in you have to pay what out um it was 20 it goes up to 25 now 28 wow basically we have over five million dollars in inventory of inventory okay right now five million curious why do you have that much were you required to do certain quantities it was a bit of a judgment call we also uh signed on with a very big endorsement personality Shaq I'm at Shaq at CES in January 2020. he came by our booth he checked it out he goes oh you know what I'm gonna do this for you I'm going to blow you what was your deal with Shaq you gave him Equity he earns it over four years but what does he earn how much a 1.25 this year okay and it can go up to five percent you're in a really tough spot right now then yeah we're in a tough spot but we're also going into the holiday season right I get that but you don't have the money to spend on it on Advertising you need to blow this out I need sharks you need money yeah yeah it's hard but it's also expertise I think I have an offer for you I would give you the 500K but I would put a royalty on it did I hear royalty yeah you didn't wear it you don't say I do say well I'm listening 25 a unit until I get back my 500k and then I would convert to four percent ownership that's not bad um can I ask you a question what do you need from a shark I think the Sharks know how to open doors they can help us to get more investment okay and going into retail also hotels and Military we have so many military members that take this on deployment you ever offer anybody a half a million dollars if they didn't even acknowledge it or give you any kind of answer or any kind of thing I was thinking about you the whole time and I just the questions are coming and I so apologize so what do you think I I think it's a pretty good deal I think it's pretty good deal I'm not the royalties piece and paying you back what is your return rate I'm just curious oh great question and I'm happy to say that it's less than five I have an even better question yeah I mean but this is important because less than five percent yes that's really good yeah but you're overselling at this point right no it's not because some still have questions so you see how long your pitch is I was sitting for 20 minutes asking for an answer do you need the app and do you need all the rest I mean I mean today everything has an app that even just has your coach classes but we've been working on from the ground up on a new app you're losing a ton of money right now how much money could it come down if you didn't have the app this isn't just a connection and count your reps this is literally displaying how you're working I'm going to push back on that a little bit because I don't like where you're going on the app spend I look at this and say to myself why spend any money on an app when everybody's already got one so that's kind of the Tipping Point for me but they can't use a Max price it doesn't matter it doesn't matter I just we have a philosophical disagreement on the direction that's my opinion okay I'm out okay so oh my God Damon did you become more value yes I did because yeah let me see if I can get to an offer and you can tell me if it works or not so here's what I'll offer I'll give you the 500K for three percent plus I want the exact same deal that you gave Shaq in advisory shares so then that way Shaq and I can work together do stuff he's a great friend so that's what it is 500k three percent plus the five percent advisory shares vested the same way as Shaq that offer is far more generous than I was going to make you I'm out thank you Robert so did you become even more valuable thank you are we going to even talk to you guys no more questions you got to decide I think what Mark offered you is a really good offer I was gonna be a bit steeper than that so thank you I'm gonna go out I'm so happy for all you know to be here with all of you guys Damon I I definitely appreciate the offer but I just have one question for Mark well you got to make sure that question is a good question because I'm out whoa yes sir thank you so um the line of credit that we have is there a way that we can replace it or you can you can help with inventory I'm not going to commit to it now but it's certainly on the table and it's something I do all the time okay the only offer you have is Mark right absolutely Mara dude I'm like all in of course yeah yeah thank you so much all right thank you yeah awesome congrats Nazar thank you so much Damon love you man we're not talking no no no Mark is a like a perfect fit for our company this is a big game changer for us we're gonna go from a little company with no name recognition to basically a global brand it is exactly where we want to be ", "Tenikle": "next in the tank is a product inspired by a creature from the sea [Music] oh hello sharks my name is Hans dose I'm from Dana Point California and I'm here seeking two hundred thousand dollars in exchange for 10 of my company tentacle as you can see I love the ocean I especially love the octopus with all these tentacles they could do so many things at once we humans have a big problem holding phones while trying to do something else with only two hands you'll never see an octopus with not enough hands to snap a selfie currently these options for humans oh my God only serve a single function what if we had one portable product that did everything these do now we do introducing tentacle the octopus inspired suction mount for your Tech designed to empower go-getters to do their thing better totally hands-free tentacle does a million things it works with phones cameras tablets it's your car mount your bike mount your speaker Mount and hold your seahorses even a pickle holder what what and just like the octopus tentacle is waterproof and super durable it can even support the weight of a surfboard wow humans only have two hands let's fix that so sharks what do you say you jump in with a fellow sea creature like me and make a huge Splash in the boring Mount industry I like it I really really like it thank you how much do you sell it for how much does it cost you to make sell it for 45 wow yeah we're selling at 45. uh we've tried different price points but cost me six dollars and eight cents currently whoa with that version wow okay but wait how many of you soul over 40 000 units to date 40 000 3 million in sales how many years ago so I actually wrote the patent myself in 2015. wow I was working at Hurley as a designer it was really my dream job working in the surf industry and I I just had this idea what if I combined a car mount and a tripod into one and when I gave the product to friends and family this crappy prototype that I made every person had this discovery moment where they were like oh my God I can use it for this or hey I can use it for this and there's so many use cases for it that I was like oh I have to do this obviously so at the end of 2017 I launched a Kickstarter we raised about 172 000 and blew my mind wow and then I thought oh my God I have to quit my job I have to do this so when I do something I go 110 I quit my dream job the product that you see here generation four what was wrong with version three on Amazon I saw that there were some reviews that were not we had a 3.7 star review and I was like okay that's still not I knew that why why didn't people like it honestly the suction cups that was the biggest thing suction cup geometry is a whole science what did it cost to go through all these iterations um well to be honest my debt is 270 000 currently 270 000. what is your last year of sales so last year we did about 478 000 in sales and what did you do last month last month we did about nine thousand oh not good what happened I want to tell you what happened so we were doing so well in 2020 despite covid so many people were using this product for face timing or Zoom calls and the year prior I had run out of product so this this year I freaked out and I ordered a shipping container full so at cost it was about 130k and why didn't it sell Thanksgiving day comes and I ran out of Marketing dollars to continue going my only sales were coming from one channel that is our website and paying Facebook ads I was how much inventory do you have right now about 891 thousand dollars at cost about a hundred and eleven thousand dollars it costs but you don't have to really pay for ads necessarily you could do your own videos put them up on on social media platforms is this your full-time gig this is my full-time gig my wife and I we work together on this business and to get out of our debt situation we moved into an RV I'm not kidding an RV on my mom's property in Menifee California all right sure so it is clear you're all in yeah you're all in if you don't get more Capital buy ads yep you're going to zero no that's what I think no because you've got 110 000 in inventory your worst case you're going to flea markets on weekends and demonstrating and selling them there how much cash do you have cons I have 39 in the bank oh what 39 how did you get here no I am just enough to get home how are you gonna get back with that you're gonna have to sell your flippers these would be worth a lot actually yeah you're right well hunts let me look at it this way one saving aspect to this is the product's pretty good it's really good fundamentally I can't criticize the product and I can't criticize you you're a good guy thank you I get it you need to get capital I love you dude that's the first also in the end I don't need another job it's not a situation I want to put myself into I wish you the best I'm out thank you thank you sir so I think it's a good product I think you're in a very crowded space it's just not the right investment for me at this time I wish you good luck thank you thank you I can make it happen I know I can yeah I incurred some debt along the way but it's serviceable all right my monthly payments are about three grand a month three grand isn't a lot but it is when you got 39 in cash you know so often on Shark Tank we have to peel the onions so deep to get the truth and you just came out here and bear your soul I appreciate that I think you need a reboot so I'm going to make you an offer you owe total debt 270 000 right I will give you 270 000. we pay off the existing debt to everyone okay and basically that brings the company back to Ground Zero yeah I will then give you an additional hundred thousand to seed the new company here's the catch though I own 60 you own 40. here's the caveat you're gonna have to bring in real Partners who are going to run the business bad idea the next partner we bring in is another Hans who has the level experience has the experience in this area and whatever Equity we need to give them it'll come out of my sixty percent well that's interesting all right Hans let me let me tell you why I think my fellow sharks are tucking and rolling out of this deal because of your vulnerability to say you only have 39 right and a lot of people come on here and they they act like everything's all great so I say well why are you here but on the flip side I get it you know when I had turned my mother's house into a factory I took a hundred thousand dollar loan it was the biggest and the largest amount of pressure I ever had in my life three months later I turned around and I only have 500 in the bank I was three months later on the mortgage right I was paying for raw Goods 90 days ahead of time I'm paying for a staff and salaries and my accounts receivables they wouldn't pay me for 30 60 90 days yeah and it was this moment in my life where my mother came home and said I'm gonna take an ad out in the newspaper I said that's the stupidest thing I ever heard she took out an ad million dollars in orders need financing I got 33 offers the next day 30 of them were loan sharks and people like Kevin O'Leary you're lucky I was there for you Damon one with Samsung's textile Division and my mentors now and they believed in me yeah I had nothing zero yeah I believe in you but it's gonna be expensive because this is such high risk yeah but I'm gonna offer you the two hundred thousand dollars for one-third one-third 33 in the third okay 33 and no 33 to third let's make it let's make it an even 30. I know you know my back's up against the wall but that's not well at least two are honest up against the wall but I'm putting money at risk yeah I understand okay um and actually that's not a bad offer All Things Considered it's better than I would have done I'm out okay thank you Mark you have an offer from Robert and you have an offer from Damon no it isn't Robert Robert it is a legitimate offer and I really appreciate your offer it would just break my heart for how much I put into it and for those Reasons I'm out have you been always wanting to say that forever I this is a moment right here dude we're good yeah I like this damn it what would you feel about 25 percent for the 200k I feel 30 sounds really good no it sounds tasty but really you came down from 33 in the third remember I went to 33. I went back to 30. you did yeah dude I think we could do a killing together I think you can open up a ton of doors and I can execute I know I can execute what's your best counter 25 it's my best counter offer I I love it I think I will take it at 30. that's hard man ah [Music] let's do it I like the counter ", "Black Sands Entertainment": "[Applause] next up is an entertainment company with

like this all the time assad you need to think this through there is nothing to think about black sands you can read it and watch it let's go all right well you know what i'm gonna start here and not just because i'm black but because i understand the value behind ip the want in need for it um what's the cost that you put into this so far so our animated property which is an eight minute pilot is 250 thousand and ternes is the expert in that he is our head of studio is this all self-engineered self-developed yeah like i've been in the business like 25 plus years been with disney pixar like major studios and i left all that to join black sands because it's something i really believe in and what i saw was like a real winner how are you creating a revenue stream most of our revenue stream is physical books that's what we do um currently we're on pace to do about 120 000 units this year direct to consumer direct to consumption what do you sell them for so we sell that one for it costs two dollars at landing 20 retail and eight dollars wholesale good for you 20 retail is that a typical retail price that is the typical retail price um you mentioned comic books as well we have a lot of comic books we have 12 titles that are currently signed to black sands the one that you currently have in your hand is our flagship title which makes the bulk of our money so from comic book one to now what has been the progression of sales that have gotten you guys to that number of 120 000. um in our first year we did about 40 000 in sales we just started in 2017. in 2018 we did about 220 000 in sales uh 2018 we raised capital for um a dvd we built that in 2020 we had 600 000 in sales this year we're at 800 000 in sales year to date yeah year to date emanuel and giselle what's your backgrounds so i'm a military veteran i serve it in thank you for your service thank you so much and we took that military background me and my husband and you're married yes we are did you know anything about animation anything about college you didn't know anything but with the military background we knew how to execute and manage a business and who created the stories manuel i'm a big entertainment guy i constantly see the same egyptian story flop over and over again in the industry they're very detached from the historical setting and so i said i'm gonna make my own story about egypt i'm gonna put everybody in the middle east into it so we got spartans minoans canaanites you got the whole bible right there right you got the whole middle east involved educators they love this stuff so so the next big question is your profitability and cash burn this year we're 108 000 in the green how much cash do you have in the bank 300 000. uh to kevin's point on leveraging ip where do you see the series going right you've got to have a place you like to see it because it's not a traditional television absolutely type thing so we are eventually going to find a distributor right let me stop you right here just um i act as a one-stop shop i'm a distributor i'm a production hub um 500 000 is a lot what are you using the money for so the money that we're going to get um you know when we get this deal right is to expand just like that you're going to get that thing everybody's got confidence i like it i like it i'm telling you right now we do eight issues a year we will massively expand it we'll probably get to 30 different issues a year including pumping out at least a full season of the main title and all these ridiculously lovable characters in the series they get their own series see but when i when i ask you that question i'm i'm expecting a clear answer tell me where you're spending the money that's what i need to know hiring artists to basically build this pipeline i need writers too and everything else these artists are like 30 40 000 each every single year all right guys i do understand what you're doing and i understand the world the five percent is that's ridiculous i'm gonna throw that out the one though that can't happen i mean you're asking for an investment and you're asking for uh added value and you're creating ip so i'm just gonna tell you the value i feel like i'm bringing to you before i give you my offer okay i own distribution in the world of audio i own distribution in the world of television because of my ecosystem and what i know we can bring to the table i see the significant value in just a brand and if you have a brand and you're already moving product in that brand that's a value to me because if you do strike gold in this space and you get to the world of toys etc well this can be this could be money makers oh i'll just curse i'm sorry this can be a little bigger this can be a money maker so i am going to put an offer on the table where can i get in there of course you can you tell me if you like where i'm at okay you're asking for 500 000 and you're saying we want it because we want to bring in the other people to help create we already have that we already have those people so you're not paying for that necessarily because you'll be accessing mine kev i'll help on the technology right okay i'll help on the online distribution side of it okay you've got the whole pathway in this case i've never been more comfortable about taking about taking an asset and being able to bring value to an asset this is what i do you're the green light that they need in order to get to the next level right look you got 500 000 on the table but we went 30 percent and i and i think that's more than fair can i counter you're nuts of course tell me i'm crazy enough 500 000 for 10 between the two of you and perpetuity on books 25 cents per hardcover the royalty deal no that's what i'm done with that goodness i'm here no because you know as well as i do the grand slam doesn't come from making per book it's when this gets picked up for a movie and turns into a franchise and he's the producer i'll give you glasses i'll take the royalty here's the last example okay this is this is where my creative mind goes as a ceo what i'm telling you is that my 30 ask is not because of the hypothetical opportunity i'm embedding you into my system i understand 100 percent but i raised capital on that last valuation and and to but literally go six times how much have you ever asked i've raised a million dollars and the last 500 was that five percent yeah but that's not the point it's just it's the problem here is there's partners and then there's partners get the difference some partners aren't created and when you tell your investors who you just brought in it's not about the valuation that they paid it's the valuation of where it's going so they can get a return right and by the way i would not be asking for this particular number if you didn't have to access my real resources you said we're gonna get some creative people to come in new animation new stories i have that okay that engine is already working it's already pumping you're tapping into an ecosystem that exists [Music] okay my fans [Music] they want this done so you guys got a let's deal you ", "Candi": "next up is a business that creates meaningful connections for fans [Music] hey sharks I'm Keithan hi I'm Kiante we're here from Chicago Illinois and we're seeking 500 000 for 15 equity and our company candy sharks imagine this think back to when you were a kid think about your favorite celebrity or athlete that you always wanted to meet now imagine if you had the chance to actually meet that person maybe it's a movie star maybe it's a five foot five comedic rock star who knows but imagine if you had a chance to actually talk to that person I'm not talking about an impersonal video where the celebrity really doesn't know who you are I'm talking about the chance to really interact with that person sounds like a dream right well at Candy we're making dreams come true with one memorable meet and greet at a Time Candy is a social network that allows fans to video chat with their favorite celebrities and influencers but don't just take our word for it take the word of grammy award-winning artist Maya it's Maya here you look amazing in that dress by the way and hello sharks it's such a pleasure to be in the tank with you I love being on candy so I could chat with fans just like you and I hope that you give them a great deal much love everyone peace and blessings [Music] so sharks which one of you wants to walk the red carpet with candy so is this a business that you already have up and running yes so we launched in April of 2020. since launching we've made about over a hundred thousand dollars what's the business model let's say I want to talk to Kevin Hart what happens yeah absolutely so each celebrity sets their rate for a five minute virtual meet and greet of that rate they keep 75 we earn 25 how it works is you come to our website you find Kevin's profile you suggest the time that you would like to meet with him our team coordinates to try to make that happen as Kevin said his price yes Kevin each celebrity sets their own rate but obviously we consult with them what's the lowest and highest price yeah we have celebrities Tick Tock influencers as low as you know five or ten bucks and we have you know Chaka Khan is 400 bucks what's the engagement that you've had with your customers and how big is the platform absolutely so we have over 350 celebrities and influencers to date we've done over 2 000 meet and greets uh 40 of our fans have used our service at least four times where are these fans coming from we don't do any traditional forms of marketing right now we get our customers from our celebrities posting on our social media and uh so you're using you're using the platform of the celebrities that you guys have in hopes that you'll get a return and engagement from their fans to come over to Canada so candy doesn't necessarily have an engine that they've built that you guys are using to distribute from well we would say the engine is the celebrities right that you you posting obviously to your to your fan base you'd be a billionaire if he posted once yeah exactly yeah so tell us about you we were really like a cliche couple I was a captain of a cheerleading team he was the captain of the football team following High School I attended the University of Illinois where I graduated within three years with honors and we actually had our first son Scotty my last year of undergrad so that was definitely difficult when we launched candy of April 2020 I was four months pregnant with our Second Son Chase his birthday is today and up until Labor and Delivery I was still working in the next day after I delivered Chase I had to work a meet and greet and I had my baby on my boob and my laptop say we don't really have maternity policy at uh candy what's your background so unfortunately I was born to a mother who abandoned me and my two younger brothers when I was just four years old um fast forward a little bit I get to college I had an opportunity to play division one college football at Eastern Illinois University I'm having the best time of my life but I was unhappy because I knew what my younger brothers were facing on a day-to-day basis and so after my freshman year I was 19 years old I went back and I adopted my 14 and 15 year old brothers becoming their father so I was a full-time division one college athlete I was a single father of two teenage boys and I also graduated undergrad in three years with my bachelor's applied engineering so in our house if you graduate with a bachelor's in more than three years you probably slapped you then I had the opportunity to go to law school at the University of Illinois College blog graduated in three years yeah and for the past six years I've been practicing emergency Acquisitions representing some of the biggest companies in the world how did you think of the idea yeah absolutely we saw some reaction videos from some competitors in the industry and we saw how United fans were happy and crying and elated and we said how amazing would it be instead of someone giving you the phone and saying press play they gave you the phone and Barbara was actually there to have a conversation with you how much more personal that experience would be the first thing to understand is this we have no in no experience in Hollywood no connections I'm not a manager she's not an agent no connection we were everyday people sitting on our couch and the first week from us have an idea of really trying to push candy to being live we've got 26 influencers and celebrities in one week how we do that is hustle you guys are asking for five hundred thousand dollars what are you gonna do with the money so we want to do three things uh most importantly we want to have better technology yes we do want an app and two we want to hire more team for our talent acquisition um so we can hone in on more quality talent and lastly we want to increase our marketing effort so you really need an app because it's very hard to get people and acquire customers and fans yes I mean it was missed out on the web I think it was even harder is you know the the talent pool right the talent pool is going to guarantee your return which is where I'm having trouble because you know these things have existed before and the reason why they come far-field in between in a place of success is because they fall apart based on not being able to stay true to what the commitment was and I just don't know if there's a world where you can guarantee that type of talent yeah no one says it's a bad business for them it's not right you look if you're doing a hundred thousand dollars and you're making netting 25 right and you're working from home that's not a bad business but that's a different question than whether or not it's an investable business and if I can interject I think it is right I heard you say before Mr Wonderful you're looking for a great business model you can pour gasoline on if you look at what we've been able to do with no experience in the industry no relationships no ties you pour a little vaseline on that you're gonna have a huge if you asked for a lot of gasoline honestly I I love the attempt and I love the effort I just think it's too early to attach myself or get involved even from an investment perspective because we don't really know if this is something that not only works but who's to say that somebody won't swoop in and do the bigger version of candy right well guess what Kevin that can be us we just need your validation right we need the fact that Kevin Harter said he puts his name in the step on that life's not that way you don't get some golden bullet that just fills a business it just doesn't happen that way that was a big problem when you said well you know we're going to use our celebrities and and then from them in hopes get people to come on in X Y and Z it's a trickle effect you don't have a engine right now that you're saying we know for sure we have 10 000 people that we're accessing and that we're beating up and that we want to start with and in hopes with these 10 000 people well we want to grow some awareness in candy it was all based on the talent that you hope to get thing you guys came in extremely aggressive with the number and the the business model it just didn't match the ads so it's honestly too early for me I I have to say it I'm out you made a fundamental Shark Tank mistake you asked for 500K right and you only gave up 15 and you're expecting us to to be that door opener all the time that's a lot of work that's a lot of obligation and so the numbers don't make sense to me so for that reason I'm out I'm curious as to see like what what numbers are investable if this was 50 000 in a flyer maybe but it's five hundred thousand it's it's too much gasoline for me I'm out they're a walking billboard of inspiration for anybody who's 100 but the ask is just too much and like the other sharks that's the reason I'm out of smoke thank you I appreciate that Lori Lori what happened is is your ask was much higher than what you've actually sold absolutely and I'm not confident that you're going to be able to grow it that big that fast with all the competition that's out there already I'm so sorry but I'm out Ethan you guys are smart you will figure it out and we are yeah thank you guys thank you thank you have a good one we do regret them out of the ass but it was great meeting Kevin Hart anytime you have a guest shark like that that can give you such invaluable advice um you know I feel like we got a free Council a Consulting session right really is how I feel I'm way too familiar with that space and a lot of mistakes early on in my business career were made in that space oh really oh yeah all based off of oh said person has this many followers if we get them to do this then this is going to be a success and that's not true can have high numbers but what's important is high engagement exactly ", "Snactiv": "[Applause] first in the tank is a tool that takes snacking to the next level [Music] [Music] hi sharks i'm kevin and i'm edwin and we're the founders of snactive we're seeking 200 000 in exchange for 10 equity of our company sharks have a look at kevin here he really loves his snack i work with kevin for many years and to call him a slob is an understatement i never got things back for him without stains or grease hey eddie check out this concert i've been working on oh this is disgusting man dude what was that for so shark as a problem maker i became my own problem solver whoa we revolutionized snacking and create the snacking tool of the future that's right sharks working from home in the past year i got tired of being in such a slob at my desk that's right sharks working from home in the past year i got tired of being such a slob at my desk like many i love to enjoy a snack while i'm gaming or working but keeping your hands and devices clean all at the same time is a challenge i even try using these chopsticks but they're super inefficient so i asked myself there's gotta be a better way and that was the bertha snack oh lord it streamlines snacking and keeps your hands and devices clean while you're working gaming typing texting or swiping it installs between your pointer and middle finger and keeps your hands completely mobile and free by installing snap div you'll be more hygienic more productive and you'll look super cool it's like having an extra pair of fingers [Laughter] no more dirty keyboards licking your fingers or piles of napkins let snacktiff update your snacking experience who's ready to get snapped who's ready to get active okay so guys can you actually type on your keyboard with both of those attached to both hands yes it's just like this right you just put on your fingers like this yeah and then you just i could see it pick up your snag like instantly i just got happy how much does it cost you to make them landed cost right now is two uh two dollars and sixty cents for the snack div and then two dollars and eighty two cents for the uh snack with case landed how'd you come up with this idea uh it was a few months before covet had covered hit and i was working from home i was snacking i found myself licking my fingers you know and wiping it on my shirt i was touching my mouth my keyboard it was disgusting right you might be my next husband i don't have to make a deal here today i just marry you [Laughter] so why is this worth two million bucks we're five and a half months old we should be launching in the next week or two and we did up to date we did 187 thousand dollars in sales i've been sitting here writing all my notes with it on you know perfect that's exactly what we want to see yeah i'm such a slob right i mean my 12 year old son jake literally just bought me a new keyboard because he wouldn't come down to my computer in my office because he said it was so disgusting and so yeah this is timely and perfect i noticed that you don't have lenses in your glasses or it might just be yeah these these are props like i mean i just wanted to look kind of nerdy he got lipstick those are fake that's awesome kevin i got to be honest with you i like it and i like the simplicity of it it's just easy simple and fun you're not planning to put this to retail this is direct to consumer forever right we have plans for retail we noticed a high increase of interest in asia so we actually put in place um an international dealer in korea we put a in taiwan and we're working with the hong kong district world domination yes yeah yeah and we sold over 50 000 in international pos is it patented we have a utility pack so you have a utility patent pending and did you mean to say that you have filed it we filed with the acceleration so it has been oh yes all right i like it i'm going to make an offer it fits into my portfolio of crazy chicken deals got to be a royalty guys 200 000 i give you that i want to buck a unit till i make back a million then the royalty goes away completely but i get my 10 percent of my concerns in case we sell this to ibm um ibm just saying so before we you know thank you for the offer that's an offer it's better than what you started with which was nothing very very grateful i just wanted to mention a couple other things that we're working on we actually launched a big marketing initiative with one of the biggest food delivery services in the nation that are limited edition exclusive to their brand they'll be shipped to their dashboards across the nation wow i like to call it wonder chop he's already trying to change your name i mean that's that that's not a good thing off the back it's going to be some custom ones here's what i think right i think this is an amazing product i love the idea i love the fun behind it um i want to be involved right but i think lori would be an amazing partner for me in this space as well as you just because of what she does on the retail side um also as a personality i think the idea of marketing behind this product that's what i do very well i market i know how to reach consumers i think the lawyer myself can really bring value to this what you're up we'll key let me get there kevin stop trying to bully me okay let me get there stop trying to bully me please okay how about we say 200k and we just want 20 percent yeah for two of us that's it you guys we'll go 10 and 10. 10 and 10. it makes us jump out of bed and you should say yes to that deal before something changes lecturing too i can get this cost down for sure you're going to make a much better margin would you guys be willing to do at a 15 listen to what you're doing and look at the opportunity right you clearly see where the advantages are in your favor from taking this deal we don't want to go back and forth just to be competitive i'm going to modify my 20 percent i'm dropping it 50 cents and i'm dropping the equity of five percent just squeeze it because he knows that he made this he knows that he made an aggressive offer global instantly there's no i think it's not a no-brainer we'll take your deal that's a good goal i like it let's go talk to our partners and give them a handshake you should you shouldn't have came in so hot cap that's your problem so good this is really good man love the personalities love i'm very disappointed in you guys thank you thank you you did it man thank you wow this is super exciting kevin's one of the funniest guys i know kevin hart not kevin choi and having laurie in there this is going to be great right she's super good at manufacturing marketing we're just going to really blow this up i don't know why you came in my deal was much better than yours it was the best no it wasn't it was so he always thinks his deals are better than that i want a dollar off a dollar he got a million dollars after me i get my money back and after that it was so it was so aggressive those guys had such a nice quality about them you should have lowered your tone you should have been much more appealing i'm telling you and they and they probably would have seen it they didn't see where you were coming from i really like it laura i'm i'm happy to be your partner i am happy to be your partner we're going to blow this up i love it you ", "The SMART Tire Company": "Volgende is 'n maatskappy wat hoop om\nverander die vervoerbedryf met 'n innoverende ruimtetydperk\nMateriaal. Maak 'n ingang. Ek hou daarvan. Haai\nHaaie, My naam is Brian Yeni. Ek is Earl Cole en ons is van Los\nAngeles CA Sharks Stel jou 'n alledaagse voor\nproduk wat sewe keer per misluk tweede in die VSA alleen en genereer\n\u00a3 50 miljard giftige afval elke keer Jaar. Stel jou nou voor dat dieselfde produk\nis eers ver terug gepatenteer in 184718401747 dis so oud die lig\ngloeilamp het nog nie bestaan nie. Kyk ons het 'n man op die maan gesit,\nons het robotte op Mars gesit, maar tog. Hierdie spesifieke produk het nie\nhet in meer as 100 jaar baie verander. Weet Wat is dit? Dis reg mense,\ndie alledaagse rubberband gevul met lug en staal word plat. En dis\nhoekom ons begin het. Die Smart Tire Company,\nDie w\u00eareld se eerste ho\u00eb prestasie luglose bande gemaak van ruimtetydperk\nmateriaal wat eie gebruik tegnologie tot 1ste uitvind dat NASA,\nOns gebruik 'n gevorderde materiaal genaamd Nitinol. Dit is 'n vormgeheue-legering\ndis elasties soos rubber, tog sterk soos titanium. Wow. Emory Alloy Radio Tegnologie of\nSMART sal die manier waarop voertuie verander op en van die pad af optree. Slim bande\nmaak vervoer veiliger, hulle is beter vir die omgewing\nen hulle word hier in die VSA. So haaie vir $ 500,\n000 in ruil vir 2.5% ekwiteit. Wat wil by ons aansluit en weer verbeel\ndie wil en die bou van die volgende Grote Amerikaanse bandmaatskappy,\ndie Smart band maatskappy? Dis koel. Laat ek voorstel wat\njy kyk hier. Hierdie groot blink bande. So dit is eintlik 'n\nlente band. Dit was oorspronklik ontwerp vir missies na Mars,\nvir maanekspedisies. Ons het 'n paar gekry vere voor jou. Wat jy\nhet net daar, 'n bietjie ruimtemetaal. Mash gerus\ndit op. Jy kan rof wees hiermee Materiaal. Vertel hulle van die fiets.\nSo dit gaan ons eintlike wees eerste kommersi\u00eble produk. Dit is 'n\npure nag en alle fietsbande wat sal absoluut,\npositief nooit plat gaan nie. Wow. So jy besit dit nie eintlik nie\nTegnologie. Jy het 'n band ontwikkel, gebruik daarmee, nie waar nie?\nDis die idee. Ons lisensieer dit van NASA. Daar is regtig 'n handjievol mense\nop planeet aarde wat hierin werk Materiaal. Ons het eksklusiwiteit met\ndie fietsband en die mikrofoon en mobiliteitsmark waarheen ons gaan\nMark. En dan is daar 'n stuk ontbreek hier wat die rubber is\nIntegrasie. En so is ons patent hangende op die integrasie van die nag\nen alles met rubber. Om enige band op aarde,\njy gaan daardie rubber nodig h\u00ea. So Ek het dit nodig wat ons sien\ndaar is in die rou vorm. Ja\nmaar hulle sal moet wees bedek met rubber. Presies. OUKEI.\nJy het eksklusiwiteit vir die band Gebruik. Dis \u2019n goeie vraag. Ons\nhet eintlik 'n Ruimtewet-ooreenkoms met NASA,\nsodat hulle ons help om te kommersialiseer Hierdie. Maar dit antwoord my nie\nVraag. So waar is jy nou, Regs. Jy het toegang hiertoe gehad\nTegnologie nou moet jy dit in 'n\nbesigheid, nie waar nie? Ja. Vertel ons van daardie besigheid.\nOns het tot dusver $ 1.3 miljoen ingesamel en crowdfunding, crowdfunding,\nekwiteit crowdfunding, ekwiteit crowdfunding,\nen dit was met baie min moeite en ons het die\nWaters. Dis nie 'n positiewe nie, ouens. Ek is nie 'n fan van equity crowdfunding nie,\nmaar gaan voort. Seker. Ek dink miskien net om die konteks op te stel, want\nons het nog nie eens ges\u00ea hoekom die fiets band, nie waar nie?\nSo die segment wat regtig was interessant vir ons was mikromobiliteit\nom 'n paar redes. Die een is die vinnigste groeiende segment. Ja\nEk hoef nie totaal te hoor nie aanspreekbare marktipe goed, nie waar nie?\nOns moet weet van u onderneming, wat dit reg doen. Omdat jy\nsamel hierdie geld in, U het die geleentheid gekry om dit te gebruik\nTegnologie maar jy moet uitvoer. Dit is wonderlik\nom voor te stel. Stel jou dus presies voor. Ek dink\ndit sal help om te antwoord hoe dit met jou gaan om uit te voer deur as ons verstaan wie\njy is en wat jou agtergrond is. OUKEI so ek was 'n sagteware-ingenieur vir\n23 jaar. Ek het gewerk vir onderwys Maatskappye\nspelwerk vir was werknemer nommer een by 'n tuisopvoeringsmaatskappy. Ek is 'n\nreeksondernemer van net soos Brian. Jy weet jy is nie 'n\nruimtevaarder. Alles reg Ek is blootgestel. So ek sal 'n\nGroot besigheidstrategie en bemarking Agtergrond. Het by sommige van die\ntop media maatskappye in die w\u00eareld. En dit alles doen 'n\nhoogtepunt tot waar ek nou is waar ons 'n grote kan hanteer\ntaak soos hierdie. Jy weet wat die rede is waarom ons daardie ooreenkoms kon spasieer\nOmdat ons die beste aangebied het argument en die beste strategie om\nNASA tot waar hulle ons vertrou het om gee ons daardie ruimte kant ooreenkoms.\nJulle hou aan om terug te gaan daarna, OUKEI? Ons weet dit, nie waar nie?\nOp 'n stadium wil ons bel\u00ea in 'n besigheid, nie waar nie?\nOns het 5000 vierkante voet oopgemaak laboratorium om dinge aan die gang te kry. So\ndit is die infrastruktuur vir die Moeg bietjie. So koop ons toerusting. Ons stel mense aan om te doen wat om te doen\nwerk, prototipes bou, om 'n fietsbinding te maak,\nons eerste deel van die fietsdas. Moet jy na die motorband in gaan\njou ooreenkoms? So hoe kom ons by die motorband?\nPaar dinge. Daar is 'n rede ons is baie gefokus op die rubber\nintegrasie nou. Ja daar is 'n paar groot bandmaatskappye uit\nDaar. Hulle het baie hulpbronne, absoluut kompetisie. Hulle kan nie\nkan nie rubber op 'n band sit nie. Hulle is sit dit nie op die rubber nie. Jy\nkon dit in die hoek sit. Hulle sal moet betaal jy 'n koninklike om hul lyn van\ngroot handelsmerkbande. Is dit die Strategie? In wese, ja,\ndis ons IP-heining teenoor groot en Klein. So ons is ons patent hangende\ndaarop. Ons optimaliseer steeds die Produk\ndie finale produk soos ons nog is vroe\u00eb stadium, ons is voor inkomste,\nmaar ons optimaliseer alles. Maar gaan hulle vyf keer die\nprys van 'n gewone band? Kom ons fokus op een ding, nie waar nie?\nWat kos dit jou om die Band? Ek gaan hier begin. Ja\nAbsoluut. Die band, die naglange materiaal kos ongeveer\n$ 150,00 per pond, Ons weet dus nie wat dit beteken nie. Beteken dit dat ek nie weet hoeveel\ntye om een band te maak? So om een band te maak,\njy moet onder 'n pond wees. Jy is gaan 'n swaar band h\u00ea. Luister na\nMy. Luister. Ja. Ek weet nie NASA. Ek weet nie. Ek is verlore daarby\ntaal, nie waar nie? Gee my 'n simplistiese antwoord. Hoe\nbaie geld kos dit om dit te maak ding net daar?\nDaardie ding net daar sal ons kos ongeveer 100 en 5200 dollar, $ 150,00,\nRegs. So ons gaan wiel verkoop stelle om mee te begin. Omdat dit 'n premium produk is\nge\u00efntegreer met jou beter glo Dit is 'n premium produk en hoeveel\njy gaan verkoop vir die wielstel sal ongeveer 2500 wees. Drie $ 3000 vir\ndie wiel stel. Ek kan daarvoor 'n fiets koop,\nen daar is 'n wonder wat jy nie wou h\u00ea nie om ons te vertel. Op die oomblik is die doel om uiteindelik\nKry die motors. As u verkoop Hierdie\n'n stel vir 'n fiets by 2500 en 3000, wanneer jy die motors kry,\nWat verkoop ons vir 'n miljoen? Praat jy van 15 tot 20 grand\nvir 'n stel? 10 grand? Hoeveel kos 'n stel? So as jy jou hierdie band reg voorstel\nHier dit sou ongeveer sewe $ 800.00 kos\nvir die band, wat ooreenstem met soos 'n sport\nho\u00eb-end band. Ons is net nie daar nie Nog. Weet luister ouens,\nEk dink die konsep is regtig slim. Bande is 'n pyn in die ***. Ek bedoel\nniemand wil dit moet vul nie met lug. Niemand wil terugkom nie\nen vind hul bande plat.

Dit is 'n baie volwasse mark.\nEn so aan die einde van die dag, die strategie moet wees dat as\njy het hierdie regte opgesluit, hoekom gaan jy nie na 'n reuse band nie\nvervaardiger wat reeds alles het Die verspreiding en vervaardiging\nfasiliteite en lisensieer dit aan hulle. Hoekom probeer jy die\nWiel? En ek bedoel regtig om die wiel weer uit te vind\ndeur vervaardigingsfasiliteite te begin. Ek bedoel\nEk kan nie eens verstaan hoe duur en hoe lank dit sou\nNeem.

charge the light can be charged in any USB port or computer the hat is unisex one siiz fits most and machine washable headlights provides hands-free lighting so you can do so many things and look great at the same time so sharks how about we see the Hat in action let me hear you say show me the light show me the light [Laughter] okay sharks so now that I've shown you the light who is going to show me some money so I have samples for you guys woo that is bright yes it's that is bright yeah it's 140 lumens I don't know if that means anything to you guys it does that's a nice way to wear it what because you have a to the side it's the only way to wear it oh okay I think it's a hip look you're like this is not okay I start the trends around here I know I see obviously how do these things work Peter's about to knock over at 7-Eleven um where are you selling them I'm I'm on a Home Shopping Network you are is that your only mode of selling and what have you sold there okay the lifetime company is uh 2.4 million good for you for the impressive for headlights I did 1.1 Million last year 1.1 million that is great hey what are you going to do this year in just headlights this year I'm projecting 1.7 wow what's your average selling price oh I sell at $19.99 $1 199.99 to $24 it's just on the shopping channel or you selling it other oh no no I'm selling it on my website I also I made the O list I do I'm on Good Morning America at the new office you're a marketing machine you're doing all this yourself me wow W this is the company that's impressive what's your typical order size oh okay typical well it's grown nothing under 25,000 W really you're ordering 25,000 time I'll do just 40 H is that a full is that a full container or 40,000 40,000 on HSN what you getting a half container in a half have you ever sold on QVC okay warm you get a half container you bringing a half container in or full con it depends it's relative to when I can place the order how quickly cuz I change it I mean it's not I'm not sure it's a company it's kind of a I oh it is wait wait wait my concern is this I give you $200,000 for 15% but then you get run over by a bus and Chicago in the winter what happens don't worry every entrepreneur that he talks to he talks about getting run over by a bus I only ask that of a single person because there's no why ask her if she's got keyman insurance do you have keyman insurance that means if you if you get run over by a bus I get paid big royalty do you have a patent I have a patent pending so how long has it been pending it's been pending since 2018 why is it pending so long I don't know now I have did you ever get office actions back um no well yes I did um during right before Co and then it got delayed Raquel Raquel I can't I'm not sit here and be honest I feel like you're a little bit all over the place you're a great designer you're a great endorser but from a business perspective there's a real disconnect and I think what you really need is a supercharged entrepreneur to make this happen for you no no not at all no no and that's wrong because all of the things all of the things this is my point all of the things you're talking about patent you don't really know the detail you've not chased it up she's the one running the she still selling she's still selling and making money she's an individual entrepreneur she entrepreneur I've got good news for you recel I'm going to make you an offer okay thank the noise on the sides you don't have to listen you can listen to to my offer okay very you are a bit of a crazy chicken just let's lay it out there okay I get it but I like crazy chicken like crazy I know why is he calling you a crazy tell him you're not a crazy chicken a nice way crazy chicken means energy he thinks that's that's good crazy chicken energy okay here's the deal I'll give you the 200,000 I don't want any Equity at all I'm going to take two bucks a hat as a royalty until I get my 200 back then it drops down to a dollar a dollar Forever of course as it ever and ever I have no equity so of course I get a dollar Forever yes even after she's dead okay can can I say something because this crazy chicken thing is I Like The Crazy Chicken let me let me just say something in 2016 I I got the call from HSN let's say that was March by the summer I had become really ill and when I say really ill I was misdiagnosed with 3 months it turned they told me I had pneumonia it wasn't pneumonia it was fungal pneumonia and I had been misdiagnosed for so long it leaked into my uh my leg and I couldn't walk wow so I immediately went into quarantine cuz they didn't know if it was Ebola or whatever and they had to treat it aggressively in two days I had a full stroke I had lung failure twice and um and I was on a ventilator for almost a month and I went in August 26th came out the end of September and I launched on HSN in November so I'm not a crazy chicken that's right I'm really driven that's right and I wasn't going to leave my kids so I do a lot by myself but I know I can improve in some things you championed over adversity that's good good for you and frankly I understand why that bothered you and frankly it would have bothered me too so I'm not here to speak up for kin but you know when he says that he's saying it in an affectionate way Raquel that's a journey you just took me on it's quite a lonely world being an entrepreneur and when you're on your own and I understand where that might have triggered you from every single door that has no entry on it has a door behind it and you found that door and you have a chance now to change your life forever I can help you sell this all over the world not just in the US I'm going to make you an offer [Music] I think my offer is far more wonderful than Mr Wonderful's never nobody gets a better deal than Mr Wonderful gets I can tell you that my offer is the $200,000 for 25% of your business it's a good offer you want to give up Equity you don't have to I'm I'm not a fan of royalty into perpetuity I am see she is smart mhm so um what you've done here is really quite amazing but I actually did something with someone that was a light in a cap for barbecuing and because I I concerned it would be a conflict with them is the sole reason why I am out on this but I love the product I love you and I'm so glad you're doing so well thank you yeah Rael I wish it was something where I could really add a lot of value cuz clothing is just not my thing um so congratulations on what you've accomplished but for those Reasons I'm out I most likely would have given you an offer but I think the biggest challenge I have is if you didn't get the patent in a certain amount of time I think somebody else out there is going to try to block you because the the gift and curse of being on the stage is now everybody's going to know you and now everybody's going to come out the woodwork so I think you have a good offer on the table and I'm going to step out I'm out however you have two valid offers on the table what are you going to do but let me tell you a little bit about me I've been sitting in a chair like this for a long time and I have to say I've been blown away by you because I also know what it's like to go through difficulty I started my first business at 16 things lit up for me and I was definitely young and naive and by the time I was 28 I lost everything literally everything but it was the best thing that ever happened to me because the lessons that I learned from previous I could now invest in over 50 different companies globally I think that this could be huge thank you I'm happy also to let Mr Wonderful into my deal having a bit of equity is also nice if we're going to like I like a little cash flow Peter I like a little royalty action but we could have a bit of both if you want to share it I would love to do that you could have Mr Wonderful and Mr Global yes I've just made that up by the way I don't know where I like it okay why not this deal I'll come in 50/50 with you and we get a royalty of a dollar and it goes away after let's say we get 6,000 back what about that so it's not petal you don't have to worry about that are you talking to me no we're talking together and what Equity could we have you're talking to me I stay with the 25% what about if we drop to 20% have 10% each yeah I do that what about that Raquel you could have I've lost Rec you could have Mr Wonderful and Mr Global yes we could have 20% for $200,000 okay and we've got a royalty is that how you royalty of a dollar royalty of just a dollar just so we get some cash flow to get our Capital back but I have a question can you explain when you have a royalty into perpetuity no it's not K that okay what we said listening again with Mr Global coming in all right and he asked me to get rid of the Perpetual aspect of it so what happens is we get the royalty until we've recouped 600,000 so three times on our money then it goes away forever and we're your partners we just want some liquidity deal deal congrats ra inspiring inspiring absolutely congratulations congratulations congrat congratulations thank you thank you bye all right yay it's been an incredibly difficult Journey getting here all this hard work has paid off having two sharks Mr Wonderful and Peter it makes it all the worthwhile and I cannot wait to get started for ", "VaBroom": "[Music] [Applause] first in the tank is an innovation to a common household [Music] tool are you all right yeah oh my gosh oh hey no problem Jenny no problem looking good looking good thank you hello sharks I'm Trevor Lambert from Champlin Minnesota and I'm John Badness from Whitebear Lake Minnesota and we're seeking 350,000 for 2 and a half% in our company sharks messes are everywhere whether your kid throws half their snack under the table or your cat fluffy trailing litter out of the box or me taking a spill on the tank all of us deal with messes every day but for quick cleanups who wants to lug out that bulky vacuum or break their back bending over chasing that last line of dirt with a dust pan come on now there's got to be a better way well sharks there is introducing the broom a smarter way to clean your floors no more dust banss or B vacuums required with a broom just sweep dirt and debris into a pile then tilt to the side the pressure activated nozzle quickly and easily cleans up any [Music] mess see it's a vacuum it's a broom is the broom it's quick and complete with just one sweep all of that power it's just over 2 lb so it's easy to maneuver and handle in those hard to reach places and when done just empty the trash clean it easy bombs away oh bombs away so sharks let's not sweep profits under the rug it's time to suck them up with the broom it's a vacuum it's a broom now sharks say it with us it's bom now who would like to give it a try I'd like to try it all right so sweep so sweep it nor just how you normally would so it like into a little line right cuz I or a pile then you line it up like this and it's it's pressure activated when you gaug the floor it'll turn on very cool yes all right now let's Dr let's drop the bomb want to see that happen so if our Brom logo goes up yep not bad so you all do have a sample and it's been shortened so that you can test it why don't I just buy a vacuum this really isn't intended to replace an upright vacuum it's meant for quick cleanups and that's really the goal that we're doing with vroom as a brand so tell us about you I am married five kids a little bit like a little bit like Brady Bunch that's the damn reason for the bation and that's why we do what we do um but to go back a ways back in college I was starting to come up with different product ideas eventually I was being hired by others to help them license products in 2010 I I founded a design firm and we have various industrial designers and Engineers on staff and so we do come up with some of our own products but typically we get hired uh from various folks small and mediumsized companies and that's how we met John I'm a fourth generation plumber and owner of my family company it's through that company I'm constantly seeing problems and I'm making solutions for them but that led to a lot of products that I patented and brought to Market Trevor and his company actually helped me launch one of my items and I saw a broom as just a 3D printed prototype I knew this was the time that Trevor was looking to Pivot to bring a product from prototype to retail and Beyond and when the opportunity came for me to invest I knew this was the product so this must have taken off already uh we do we we have come with sales 2% give me the last 12 months of sales and how you've done in the last 12 months we've done $3.1 million in sales wow projecting 5 million conservatively this year where are you selling them nice uh we sell uh Direct consumer and we just started retail we just delivered to Bed Bath and Beyond uh for a 2-month promo in 2 weeks they sold out of all their online stock that they had projected for the entire promo so tell me about the cost of the product what margin so it's just over $17 is a landed cost $37 wholesale and uh retails were $59.99 what was the profit on 3.1 million in it was about $300 some thousand which we've rolled right into inventory I don't see anything on the box that says patent pending or patented we have international patents uh pending we have a design patent that's issued in the US but I'm wondering how is it really different from like a dustbuster or something like that where you know it's small it's handheld versus having to have a whole boom good question I we when we developed it we just hate the dust pan it's such a frustrating pain Point nobody in the history of everybody can get everything onto a dust pan which is why we did this and people see it right away now what El what we're getting on customer feedback is we're hearing people with Mobility challenges that are coming to us this is a lifesaver I have a bad back and a stick back is too heavy for me and I can't bend over so this is now enabling them to actually clean their Forest how much have you invested in this invested $2,000 good for you John uh there was 100,000 on Kickstarter and then it was really funded self-funded by the company this firm that came up with this this industrial design firm um am I investing am I getting a piece of that great question so what we've done is we've shuffled some of our employees of the design firm into this new entity is there a contract between what I'm investing in and the design firm correct right so there's a royalty to the design firm that's a royalty did I hear royalty yeah yeah a royalty so you would appreciate that so rather than have to you know vroom to pay back the design firm for the investment we just decided it would be much cleaner if it was just much how much is that investment 5% Trevor and John why isn't it all together why have you made it so complicated well the issue is is that we have a service-based design consultancy and other products that we're launching and we but why don't you package that up well if there's interest we would we would entertain offers well otherwise it gets messy guys let me clear the deck a little bit here you guys are a design firm with inventors that are really good at that you're also good marketers but you're trying to segment things out so that you kind of have your cake and eat it too right you have to control the design firm you get to segment your product into this new company that you only want to give us 2 and 1/2% of it's not worth getting up in the morning for 2 and 1/2% particularly when your greatest skill set is more available to the design firm and anything else you come up with outside this company so for those Reasons I'm out Trevor and John I I have to say I thought your pitch was really good you clearly solve an issue I'm not convinced that the issue is that big and I hear your points that you've raised particularly with people that are actually finding it difficult to bend down but I'm not sure you need to reinvent the broom you've made it really complicated today so for that I'm out what was your initial ask 2 and 1/2% for how much 350,000 2 and 1/2% is either I just want exposure or I'm greedy I'm not saying any that's about you it just this will goes through our head right it it just doesn't feel right so oh I'm out I like the product okay I like the fact that it's selling making a deal with you is going to be complicated you need my 350,000 for inventory I assume right correct yeah all right and growing direct to consumer we we think that a shark could help us with our media effen definitely definitely and I can also sell this for you as Chef wonderful on QVC and sell a million of them yes that's not a problem but I mean I got to be incentivized to do it because there's only one Chef wonderful not two here's an offer for you I'm known for being creative with my offers I teach the Sharks how to structure things so $350,000 I give you that um because you brought up the word royalty I didn't you did I like royalties because that's how I can get my Capital back so I'll give you the $350,000 I want a $3 royalty on the vabroom until I recoup $700,000 so I'm not being greedy about this okay I just want some return of capital but I want 2 and 1 12% of the design firm because I don't know what else is coming down the PIP all right so Equity sort of a venture debt deal in in a way with the structure that I get paid back it's actually not bad for you it's not a bad deal at all listen guys I I love innovators and Innovation and you know it's a good idea but I'm not sure you'll get your patent and there's so much competition I'm sorry I'm out okay thank you Lor so as usual all roads lead to Mr Wonderful 350,000 for 22% $3 royalty until you get 700 and that's of the whole design firm yes yes you're only interested in if it's the design firm absolutely I mean look I'm hopeful that it's not just going we're going to form a relationship I'm going to help you sell these things you're going to see the power what a shark can do and I want to get the next product the next product the next product the next product that's the whole idea uh could could we increase your investment to 700,000 uh and get you to 5% no this is a good snack bracket for this particular deal I like this entry point we get this thing going it starts working we'll do many other things together ask anybody look at the Bell Pizza Guys Boost Oxygen everybody I've opt on everybody because it's working I like things that work yeah Mr Wonderful you're definitely a shark we wanted to uh do a deal with and you suck up well too um yeah Mr Wonderful You've Got A Deal nice job Kevin all right Kev let me tell you why I did this I buy a new broom for Barbara every year so she can fly around and I really like I really like this model this is fantastic thanks look forward to doing business going to be great thank you all right congratulations guys well done care thanks sharks well done guys let's go yeah buddy all right we got Mr Wonderful that's who we came in for yeah and we got it he's going to he's going to help us on media be great we kept the valuation oh absolutely we did yeah fantastic it' be great to have him actually with the design firm absolutely he will be so helpful and more way more than just for broom oh my God very exciting what a marathon a ride what aath what a ride awesome ", "TA3": "[Applause] next in the tank is a company that makes it easier to have your cake and still look [Music] great hi my name is Leela Shams I'm a fashion designer from Los Angeles and I'm here seeking $500,000 in exchange for 10% of my company sharks we all want to look amazing in a swimsuit and when we don't we blame our bodies well it's time we start blaming the real enemies first up the bikini this flimsy thing is doing us no favors and next we have the typical one piece no support they're either too short or too long no thank you and the suits that do have support like to hide your curves so much fabric so much draping oh it hurts my eyes Sharps I believe that your suit should support and enhance your body and that's why I created ta3 the world's most flattering [Music] swimsuit simply pull oh sorry oh sorry sorry best part of the presentation oh god um the world's most platter swimsuit what do I say next don't believe me don't believe me sharks pick it up pick it up from the um and that's why I created t83 the world's most flattering swimsuit don't believe me sharks see it for yourself simply pull the ties on the back of the suit to reveal a gorgeous sculpted shape and that's it let the compression and lacing do the hard work for you sharks my suits are not just a piece of cloes clothing their freedom freedom to relax and indulge without swimsuit stress so sharks who wants to suit up and cinch in a deal with me great job terrific is ta3 specifically designed for rubenesque women uh no it's uh size inclusive so right now I offer extra small to 3x it's thick enough material so it's going to suck you in which is we all want suck in and then here you can do it to as tight as you want but it's going to help accentuate your waist exactly okay so you did a good job of that thank you so much it's really the interior construction where there's double layer lining along the along the waist coret right yes it's similar to a corset but you'll never find a corset that is one piece you know of course it is always it to jam in your ribs yeah and they're they're woven they're non stretch so these are stret let's say you've solved a problem here okay I want to get into this 500,000 for 10% imp P of $5 million valuation y now what would tell me that you've solved a problem would be sales yep and I have sales I've been in business for 13 months and I've done 1.4 million what did you make on that 1.4 million uh 800,000 and 500,000 operating how did you do that I'm $500,000 into the bank type profit yeah well I I put most of it into inventory back into inventory Now Lea I want to understand your background a little bit I've been a fashion designer for over 20 years I was a design director in New York for multi-million and billion dollar Brands so dky jeans Express uh BB so I work for those kind of like you've been around so where who are you selling to how and how are you selling I'm only I'm only direct a consumer so I sell through my my website so what did you do to get those sales um I do a couple things the first thing was uh Instagram ads but what's been amazing is Tik Tok people see it and they're just like you know so I mean I had a customer I didn't pay a dime for this and she got 4 million views I sold out now do you have a patent on this lining I noticed there's a different lining that you mentioned you do have a patent pending so Leila it's difficult to do any clothing right so what is your return rate off of the sales of the my return rate is 20% Which is pretty on par if not a little better for for B I think it's a little low I think pry low usually women buy two sizes and then they return the one that doesn't fit my retail is quite High which um doesn't make people that enthusiastic to buy a ton of them for we don't even know talk about your business what's the sales what's your margins what's your cost landed all that uh so my cost allog together is $45 okay what do you sell it for 178 178 I invested in a swimwear company called raising wild uhhuh you know what the overreaching lesson I learned that we couldn't make the customers happy we had a return rate of about 25% by the time we developed one suit season and nipped and tucked it we were into a new color line we had so much excess inventory that we could not unload it I think you're courageous now that I've walked down that road you're half courageous Half Crazy okay but for me I'm going to go out because I just don't want to go down that road once again okay but I will say this is not a typical swimsuit company at all this is it's shaping swimwear and I don't think you would find those problems in the shapewear industry you know what congratulations on your success I mean it's enormous I mean just what you've been able to accomplish in such a short period of time and make money at it amazing progress but it's just not a fit for me so come out okay this is not a product category I'm going to invest in cuz I have no connection with it I have an Adonis body I don't need any compression I'm pretty happy so I'm out sorry what are you thinking to do with the money um buy more inventory I've been sold out almost the whole time I've been in business so I want to be prepared for next year I'm not going through this again I want to have all the inventory I need to meet my demand and my demand is huge I'm going to look at my phone after this and I'm telling you I probably sold out again I got to tell you what this inventory thing so Barber touched on a little inventory is has killed more people in our business than small pops have killed people right once you get to a level of let's say you were doing $100 million a year and $5 million of that was extra inventory times 10 years now you have $50 million of excess inventory that's taking up warehouse space it's seasonal and you have to have what we call a second door that means the TJ Maxx of Burlington to get rid of it and when you say that you paid $12 for it initially they say I'll give you 75 cents what that does is that kills all of your profit over the years so I'm really worried about the inventory so I'm out I can't believe this wait there's still one sharet left talk to me Lori um listen I think you are a great designer if you get a patent I think your play is going to a major player and Licensing that technology that thought in all sorts of different outfits I would never you would never do that no well unfortunately that would be my vision so I'm sorry I'm out thank you thank you very much thank you good luck but you don't need it you're going to do good I cannot believe the Sharks did not give me a deal they are going to regret this this is just going to be like ring like that doorbell that none of them invested in and it went that's going to be me I'm going to be the Ring of swimsuits e ", "Tania Speaks Organic Skincare": "[Music] hi sharks my name is tenia

thriving we created other products like our foaming cleanser resurfacing toner facial moisturizer and for the guys the organic beard oil our products are carefully formulated with natural ingredients like aloe vera carrot seed in oatmeal vanilla honey I turned my trauma into Triumph I turned my bullies into bucks by blending Innovation Beauty and confidence in one organic package so sharks who's ready to join me on my mission to inspire everyone to embrace the skin they in in front of you are your own products to try for yourself so now you made the comment that the brow gel tames thick brows but also helps thin ones grow yes can you explain to us why the brow gel has a dual purpose if you just want to tame your thick brows like mine you only apply it once a day just to style them lay them in place but if you want growth you have to be consistent and apply it twice a day so you sleep in the gel let it stimulate the growth agent helps the hair growth so what we have is the sap from the aloe vera plant and vitamin E the aloe vera plant is normally used for cuts Burns so when I was making my formula I thought maybe it could heal my eyebrows because I cut my brows I could not take it anymore I cried to my mom every day can I please get my brows service I wanted these bushy caterpillars off of my face and she would not allow me she said you're too young to get your brows done so I decided to cut them myself with a sharp razor I had to go to the hospital I had to get stitches it was was a traumatic experience wow I went to the stores tried to find something to grow them back and nothing worked and so I just started researching natural ingredients like what works to grow hair what works and it was just very random and I would actually just bring stuff home any type of ingredient and I would just mix it together and that formula started to work for me just the olive vera plant that was in my house vitamin E that was in my house you're like your own clinical study basically I like to think of myself as a little chemist with all this work and all this effort how are sales going sales are amazing okay so last year I did a million dollar in sales million let me borrow something a million dollars in sales last year and this year we have done 1.4 million how are you doing that how are you doing that all of our sales are fully online how I started was sharing my story I went to vending events I went to trade shows I even sold in my high school bath I had the line wrapping around the school and they would buy it they would really buy it and so I started my website I made everything myself and got it going you've got to be making a fortune if it's all online so last year I ned $700,000 not only that 700,000 you're 19 years old yes your mother Kevin get out of the chair let her sit there no your mother say what does your mother say what did my mom say she said house loves it she's like I am the proudest mom in the world wow what is the cost to make it and what price you sell it at it's amazing for the brow gel it cost us $110 to make and we sell it for [Applause] $29 shame on you that's like talking dirty Tena how'd you get started so my mom didn't have any money to give me so she actually made the investment and took out $10,000 from her 41k and I was a ble to pay her back immediately and so I feel very proud about that in regards to this how do you protect yourself against obviously the the legal trolls who say there's claims how do you do that well that's what I was wondering to be able to make the claim that it helps thin brows have you done any third party accredited lab testing we have not done that yet if not you need to okay right because the reality of this world is when you're climbing up the ladder everybody just roots for you and holds the ladder for you when you get to the top people you've never seen before in your entire life will take pot shots and try to pull the ladder out from underneath you if you make a claim right and you don't have the resource they will sue you and so so you've got to be really really really careful it's insane how good you are at what you're doing if this was my core competency I'd be all over it to help you but it's not so for those Reasons I'm out thank you so much and that's why I'm here because I'm only 19 so there's only so much information I have and I

lyn gemaak\nvan 'n unieke herwinde materiaal. Haai. Hallo Haaie,\nmy naam is Tristan Amelie Kaika Maikai Kanyakalani Persone. Ek is van\nOrem, UT en ek soek $ 250, 000 in ruil vir 5% van my\nBesigheid. Haaie, wat as ek vir jou s\u00ea dat ek 'n\nlepel uit my ma se kombuislaai, het 'n ring geskep,\nen dit in geldmaak verander Waansin?\nJy sal my waarskynlik nie glo nie, maar dit is presies wat ek gedoen het.\nHier is die tande. Ek reis almal regoor die w\u00eareld versamel lepels\nen inspirasie, en ek skep pasgemaakte versamelings\nspesifiek gebaseer op my ervarings. Deur my sosiale media doen ek 'n druppel\neen keer per maand en raai wat? Raai wat?\nDit verkoop binne minute uit. My druppels het hierdie aanlyn frenzies geskep. En\nas ek frenzies s\u00ea bedoel ek ek letterlik mense laat uitkamp in\nhul werksbadkamers veg duim en duim net om te probeer beveilig\nvoordat dit uitverkoop. Besef jy Hoe mal is dit nie?\nEk het net eendag wakker geword en ek was die ring freaking koning. Dit is omdat\nEk het die krag van handelsmerk,\nSosiale media en die unieke w\u00eareld van Genl. Z om 'n brandmerk van\nMyself. Haaie. Ek is so 'n handelsmerkgenie\ndat ek selfs 'n lepel kon vat dit was in meneer Wonderlik se mond. En verander in 'n kunswerk wat enige\nvan julle haaie sou versot wees op. So haaie,\nwat 'n ring daarop wil sit en lepel saam met my?\nKom ons kyk na hulle haaie. Julle het elkeen jou eie pasgemaakte perskassies in\nvoor jou. Hulle gaan oopmaak dit en gooi daardie koppie water agter\ndie boks met jou naam daarop. Ichihua karumba. My god\nDit is baie cool. Dankie. Oop dit op. Kyk wat binne is. Maak dit oop.\nJa. Wow. Dit is pragtig. Wow. Dit was dus 'n perskas. Ek het. Dat\nis lekker. So jy kry 'n volle Ervaring. Dis 'n aanbieding.\nDit word alles van lepels gemaak. So dis waar dit begin het en toe\nuiteindelik ontwikkel het. Maar toe ek was 12 jaar oud,\nEk het 'n familievriend met 'n lepel gesien Ring. En ek het vir my pa ges\u00ea ek dink dit\nwas die coolste ding, en hy het my na die motorhuis geneem. Ons\nletterlik een van my ma se Lepels\nen ons het dit net in 'n ring geslaan. Ek het daardie ring vir jare gedra. Vinnig\nvorentoe na toe ek 17 was en my pa het 'n hartaanval gehad. Ek onthou hoe ek daar by hom gesit het\nnet voor hy in oop hart gegaan het Chirurgie\nen ek het net verstaan hoe kort die lewe Was. Hy het deurgekom en dinge was\nregtig rof. En toe kry my ma met borskanker gediagnoseer. En in\ndaardie oomblik, Ek het 'n belofte aan myself gemaak dat ek\nsou nooit 'n las wees om Hulle. Ek gaan alles doen\nin my vermo\u00eb om vir hulle te sorg fisies, emosioneel,\nFinansieel. So ek het my suster se kamera sodat ek dit sal gebruik om te maak\nGeld. En ek het hierdie droom gehad om te reis\ndie w\u00eareld, en ek sal net woel en op 'n\nreis en dan weer stukkend wees. En ek het 'n opmerking oor een van my opgemerk\nInstagram-foto's wat s\u00ea: weet iemand waar Tristan kom\nsy ringe? En ek was soos, OK, miskien kan ek 'n paar verkoop,\nmaak 'n paar vir die mense wat wil Hulle. En dan sal ek uitvind my\nvolgende stap. En hoe lank gelede was dit Tristan?\nDit was in 2017. So ek het na die tweedehandse winkel,\nhet sowat $0,25 lepels gekoop, gooi hulle op my webwerf. En dat\nNag Ek het uit 155 ringe verkoop en ek het gemaak\n$ 4000. En ek het letterlik gedink ek is gereed om af te tree. Soos\nEk het reg vir jou stoel gekom Daar. Uiteindelik moes ek buiging ontwikkel\nduisende lepelaars. My hand was nie 'n volhoubare sakemodel nie.\nEk het dus regtig gefokus op vervaardiging. Ek werk saam met 'n voorsieningskettingmaatskappy.\nEk het ontwerp hulle begin klaarmaak. 3D pette, alles wat ons hulle stuur,\nhulle is gemaak. Hoeveel volgelinge doen jy het op Instagram? 70,\n000. Wat dan van ander platforms? Ek het pas op Tiktok begin plaas. Ek\nhet 15, 000 daar. Vinnig vorentoe na vandag,\nJa. Wat is jou verkope in die algemeen? Verkope in die algemeen is dus twee punt 1,000,\n002.1. Vir jou, wat van jaar tot datum 575,\n000? OUKEI so mense weet druppels is soos 'n\nverkoop wat jy het en dit is net 'n eenmalige uitverkoping en jy sit jou uit\nversameling of wat dit ook al is wat jy is val en wanneer hulle weg is,\nHulle is weg. Hulle is weg. Absoluut. Hoe gereeld het jy\njou druppels? So ek het my druppels een keer per maand\nOp hierdie oomblik. OUKEI so verkoop jy buite die druppels\nGlad nie? Nee. En wat is die gemiddelde prys van\n'n ring, $ 50.00. So vir jou laaste druppel,\nJa. Hoeveel stukke en wat was die totale inkomste uit daardie stukke?\nEk het dus 3200 eenhede verkoop en die inkomste was 155 000. Tristan, as jy 'n druppel doen,\nHoe vinnig verkoop jou ringe uit? Hierdie laaste een was net so 24\nUur. Ek het 'n paar gehad wat soos 20 minute. Jy is uniek. Ek kry dit.\nJy is 'n one man band. Ek gee jou $ 250,\n000 en dan word jy omgery deur 'n Bus. Hoe gaan dit uitwerk?\nSo jy sal uit geld wees en ek sal wees so jammer vir jou, maar. Die eerlikste antwoord wat ons nog ooit gehad het\nin die tyd gehoor. Ek bedoel Dit is 'n probleem hier, nie waar nie?\nJa. So op die oomblik is dit 'n baie maer Span. Ek is regtig trots op myself vir\nhoe ver ek kon neem Dinge. Ek is baie vindingryk. So ek\nDink daaraan om na die program te kyk. Letterlik van toe ek 10 jaar was\nOu Ek dink by my ingeboesem om te glo\nin myself. Maak nie saak wat jy is nie hanteer word,\njy mag hard werk. So het die uitdaging, Tristan,\nIs hoe groei jy, reg? Want as jy te veel druppels doen,\ndit verslaan die hele doel om 'n druppel te doen. Is dit nuwe lyne?\nIs dit nuwe handelsmerke? Hoe skaal jy? Hierdie een sou 'n kernversameling wees\ndit is 'n goeie inleiding tot die Merk. Dit neem nie weg van\ndruppels omdat ek so hard gewerk het om bou daardie hype en ek wil wees\nversigtig daarmee. Maar ek gaan weg geld op die tafel wanneer mense kom\nna my webwerf en daar is niks om Koop. Tristan,\nhoe oud was jy toe jy begin het die besigheid? Ek was nie. En hoe oud is jy nou?\n19. Ek was vars uit die ho\u00ebrskool en nou is ek 22. Ek dink dat jy\nhet 'n baie oulike model hier en dit is 'n wonderlike besigheid vir jou,\nmaar ek dink nie dit is bel\u00eabaar nie Vir my. Ek is jammer, ek is uit. Ek gaan voort om te ontwikkel. Ek wil regtig h\u00ea\nom hierdie besigheid so ver as ek te neem kan en bereik die volle potensiaal\ndaarmee saam. Dit is duidelik dat dit 'n baie emosionele besigheid vir jou.\nAbsoluut. Vir my om vir jou 'n Bied\ndit sal 'n voldoende hoeveelheid van u onderneming, die regte waardasie,\nen dan gaan ek jou breek Hart. Goed\nEk is hier om te praat ek is hier om te praat. Luister ons is almal lank genoeg hier en\nEk ken die regte waardasie. So ek is gaan jou nie beledig nie. Ek is uit, OK?\nVerlede jaar het ek $ 720,000 aan verkope gedoen. En ek het byna 60% daarvan behaal,\nsoos 440, 000. So ek verstaan daardie skaal,\ndaardie marge sal nie dieselfde bly vir My. Dit is ook oorspronklike probleem,\nmaar bekommerd om stukkend te wees. Ek Beteken\nEk beskou dit as 'n baie unieke Deal. Ek bedoel\njy is in. Daar is niemand anders nie. Ek is regtig ge\u00efntrigeerd. So ek gaan\nmaak jou 'n aanbod. Maar dit weerspie\u00ebl die risiko inherent aan hierdie ooreenkoms. Jy\nWeet Ek het baie meer volgelinge as jy\ndoen. Miskien 'n persentasie van hulle ek kan verander in kopers. Ek weet nie\nhoeveel omdat ek julle kan vertel albei tref dieselfde demografie. Ja\nBeslis. Ek gaan vir jou gee die 250,\n000. Dit het 'n paar terme daaraan. Ek wil jou maat wees. Dis 5050.\nEk wil 50% h\u00ea en jy moet koop. Wag 'n tweede,\nStilte. Ek het nie die geraas nodig nie. Jy gaan sleutelman moet koop\nversekering indien die baas jou doen wen, want ek is bekommerd daaroor.\nEn dan gaan ek saam met jou werk om dit op te blaas. Ek het baie\nmense saam met wie ek kan werk om dit te maak Gebeur. Ek het soveel besighede\ndit is sinergisties vir wat jy doen. En hy gaan versekering uitneem\nook op jou, wat my ook bekommer. Hoekom is\nso goed vir my om gehardloop te word Oor?\nDit is duidelik dat jy die hele besigheid is, nie sommige daarvan nie. Jy is 100%. Ja, OK. Ek is mal oor daardie aanbod,\nbaie kreatief. Maar Tristan mode is 'n baie talentgedrewe besigheid.\nJy moet die talent h\u00ea, die oog,\ndie gevoel aan beide die produkkant en die bemarkingskant. Reg in\nLaura se punt. Dit is 'n wonderlike besigheid Vir jou\nmaar jy kon nie regtig kommunikeer wat volgende is. Wat kan\njy doen om dit 'n 5 miljoen of $ 10 miljoen besigheid omdat dit is\nnie net meer druppels en meer nie Ringe. So hierdie jaar projekteer ek 1.\n6 miljoen op net die druppels. Waar die skaal sal vandaan kom, dink ek\nis die kernversameling ringe. En toe wou ek regtig inbreek\nAnder kategorie\u00eb en daardie kategorie uitbreiding sal net die handelsmerk maak\ngroter en wyer en. Is jy gereed om iemand 50% te gee?\ndaarvoor? Nee maar dink aan die waarde wat ek bring. Hier\njy is in Shark Tank reg voor van Meneer Wonderlik wat vir jou 'n\nfantastiese aanbod. 50% is te veel Toonbank. Wel, jy kan teenwerk. Ek het 'n aanbod vir jou. OUKEI. Ek gee jou die 250 vir slegs 20%,\nEk sal dit vir 15% doen. Hoekom doen jy dit nie?\nEk voel net 'n ware konneksie hier. Jy weet\ndie ou styl van in die Renaissance Tydperk\njy onthou die beskermheer en die jong kunstenaar. Dis hoe ek voel\ndaaroor. Befondsing waansin. OUKEI\nso jy het twee haaie omgedraai jou vinger. Ja. En Tristan,\nEk sal dit vereenvoudig. Ek sien net nie jou pad na skaal. In orde vir my\nom betrokke te raak, Ek moet 'n pad na 5/10/15 sien\nmiljoen in verkope. So vir di\u00e9 redes, ek is uit. OUKEI. 250 vir jou op 20? Ja\nEk is. En jy is op 15, OK. Dit is beslis wat Kevin is\nbereid om 'n ooreenkoms van 5% onder net om my te ondergrawe omdat hy 'n\n*******. Dis hoe hy rol. Nee hy is nie. Jy doen dit\nDie hele tyd. Daar is niks wonderlik oor jou. Dis hoekom dit\nnaam is so belaglik. Hy is nie die cool wat jy wil wees. Hy is 'n\nDier. Hy is agter die bok aan. Dis baie sleg as jy moet praat\njou mededinger. Ek doen dit nooit met Barbara. Ek vier fees. Jy\nmoet iets weet. Die enigste rede waarom sy vandag hier is, is dat ek gekoop het\nvir haar 'n nuwe besem. Ek sal jou vertel waar ek dit sal plak\nVan. Luister\nEk weet nie hoekom jy 20 sou opgee nie wanneer jy 'n ooreenkoms vir 15 kan doen. Dat\nmaak nie sin nie. Die 5% gaan nie jou verander nie\nLewe. Dit sal regtig. Nie baie nie Duur. Jou $20 miljoen maatskappy,\n5%, jy sal nie eens weet jy het dit gegee nie.\nJa. Wat wil jy doen, Tristan? OUKEI. Kevin, jy het 'n ooreenkoms. Cleveland met die draak kan nie wag nie\nom saam met die man te werk. Ek is baie opgewonde. O\nBaie baie dankie. Dankie Ouens. Dankie vir die ring. Dankie.\nEk hou van daai ou. Dit was minder ekwiteit en ek is regtig\nbeskermend oor alles wat ek het Gebou\nmaar ek is baie opgewonde om net te neem dinge na die volgende vlak saam met hom. Ek\nweet hy is ongelooflik in wat hy doen en ons sal net onstuitbaar wees. Dit\nwerk wel. Het jy gedink hy is gaan my vrou vat?\nEk kan dit nie glo nie. Verskriklike. Jy wou net wen.\nJy het van 50 na 15 gegaan. Dit was omdat jy my wou uitslaan,\nDis al. Daar was geen liefde daar nie. Ek sal vir jou 'n ring stuur. Voordat jy gaan,\nmoenie vergeet om in te teken op die Shark Tank YouTube-kanaal en ring\nDie kennisgewingklok om tred te hou met alles wat inborrel\ndie tenk. ", "Calm Strips": "next up is a product to help anxiety hi sharks I'm Michael Malkin and I'm Lucy Fuller and we're from Newport News Virginia today we are seeking 250 000 in exchange for 10 of our company com strips com strips are a cool new way to help people reduce their anxiety and that is just scratching at the surface have you ever had a day like my animated friend Charlie here this traffic is stressing him out this cartoon Cloud came out of nowhere and Charlie forgot his umbrella oh Charlie and now his phone is blowing up with angry messages from his comically evil boss we've all gotten them but this brings Charlie's anxiety to an all-time high luckily Charlie remembers he has calm strips a healthy way to calm and ground himself comp ships might look like any other sticker but they're actually textured sensory adhesives people everywhere are rubbing scratching or picking at the textured surface of their calm strips to help reduce fidgeting increase focus and regulate Restless energy they're reusable and residue free meaning they can be stuck to your phone your laptop your desk teachers and students alike love them because it helps kids manage their own Restless energy without disrupting the rest of the class so sharks who wants to invest in bomb strips and show the world how easy it is to take a little bit of calm with you everywhere so in front of you I see you guys are all about it already I love that um so we have both the soft sand and the newer River Rocks Textures in the calm circles and calm strips how does this work I originally came up with the idea for com trips because I for the last 13 years before doing com trips worked in an Apple retail store it's a really busy environment and I found that it was incredibly stressful and it would kind of trigger my anxiety so I found that I started wrapping a little bit of Carpenter's tape around my finger and kind of rubbing on that it would help me to kind of calm down and science does show that touch especially tactile sensory touch can have a significant impact on reducing people's anxiety and making them feel calmer so guys I just don't get it what was your market research though you say it worked for people the reason I say that is because over a hundred thousand people get it we have a return rate of less than one percent what does it cost to buy one of these you get a five pack of either for 12.49 what does it cost you to make it the soft sand cost us one dollar and for the River Rocks it costs two dollars I love them e-commerce so it does cost us a couple you know about three hours or so margins how much do you sell any of this stuff yeah so we launched early last year you guys hold on to your socks there you go since then uh we've just crossed 2.5 million dollars in sales [Music] I love um [Applause] do you have a zero return rate because it's so inexpensive to buy that people aren't going to bother to ship it back and in fact what I will say is that we don't even make people ship the product back if they don't like it and they let us know they don't like it we offer them a full refund so it's not even sure the shipping cost talk to me about the trend line are the sales continuing to increase at the same pace for the last three months so we've done about four hundred thousand dollars in the last three months you've got to be making a boatload of cash last year we had a profit of about 193 000 this is our slow season but Mike why would there be a slow season because people have less anxiety in the summer stress is not seasonal and that is a huge part of who we sell to we're in 3 000 schools as of right now we've actually spoken to doctors we've had special ed teachers and they all agree they all use our product they all agree that you know to funnel excess anxiety energy which is what it is it's your fight or flight in in gear right so put it here put it somewhere I accept the premise my my God kids are autistic and one of the things we're really trying to do with them is to calm them down we try to get them in their case it's not this it's a small blanket yeah it's sensory um 45 million Americans live with anxiety I don't think this is an issue that is ever gonna go away um I talked a little bit earlier that when we built this company we we built it from the heart and we're not in this to make a buck I wasn't going to mention this in this pitch but I I have a five-year-old son who was recently diagnosed with autism and like we hear from parents who say this is helping my son and my child and so I'm not someone who's in it for the buck I'm really truly in it to help people Lucy I called her out of blue and said can you come help me with this and she said yes and I think it's easy it's easy to look at and say this is silly sure it does look silly but we do absolutely everything we can we have a poster hanging up in our office that says at com trips we want all of our customers to be happy these numbers are just astonishing amazing impressive but I don't get it I'm out yeah but congratulations I'm excited about that thank you look it's a great business for you guys but in order for it to be investable in my opinion it's got to be a multi-product company that scales so for those Reasons I'm out all right guys nobody buys fidget Spinners anymore they had a purpose they were selling a lot a year from now what if no one's buying this we are working on something right now where it can be die cut into shape so you can trace your finger along it I think there's a lot to do I mean it's always the texture you see a lot there's a lot of room for growth here I want to come along for the ride but I need to get my money out so Michael here's my offer I will give you the 250 000 um 35 percent I believe in it but I don't want to risk my money can we can we counter back because that's a lot of percentage there's a lot there's a lot of percentage it's a lot of sharks sure um or let's cheer this off no equity zero okay I want two dollars and fifty cents a unit until I get back my 250 000 and it drops to a buck in perpetuity I am allergic to the word perpetuity sir I respect that but we don't know if this has Perpetual life at all I'm I'm hoping you'll come up with another product all right I like that better I will give you 250 000. two dollars and fifty cents a unit until I get my money back and then a dollar fifty until I get a 3X return on the initial Capital the difference is my deal ends this one for as long as the word perpetuity is there I believe this how much would you allow me to make when I give you 250 000 I get it back I've made no money we talked about this a little bit earlier it's important for me does Lori have anything she wants to do Lori's not officially out it doesn't offer you'd give me how about two hundred and fifty thousand dollars guys hang on hang on I look I learned a long time ago there's no point in crashing a party that people don't want you in you obviously don't want to deal with me I'm out I would do the same offer as Kevin but I would want to get eight percent equity in the company two dollars and fifty cents a unit until we got I get my 250 000 back and then a dollar fifty until I get 750 000. no in perpetuity no equity that's the offer I made you so here's my question would you be willing to do 250 000 for just 20 equity with no royalty no I I really want to blow this up we want to go really quick and I really think I'm trying to be fair for you because I really like you guys and I believed in it let me ask you until you stood me up we haven't been on Shark Tank before never be back you put your offer back on table I'll take it right now no questions asked don't stand me up for a maybe we shake hands oh the fans go wild [Music] we walked into the tank wanting to work with Robert so when he went out it was heartbreaking and I was heartbroken but we're like we can bring him back in and when we got him back in it just my heart sang I mean it's everything that we wanted ", "Kettle Gryp": "[Music] first in the tank is a way to transform your workouts [Music] [Music] hi sharks I'm Dan from Missoula Montana and I'm Andy from Locust Grove Georgia we're the inventors of the kettle grip kettlebells have become increasingly popular and provide Dynamic full body workouts that build functional strength and range of motion however kettlebells are expensive nearly impossible to travel with and take a valuable floor space so I began thinking of a way to turn the dumbbells that I already owned into kettlebells and that's when the light bulb went up I made a rough sketch and I sent it to my best friend Nancy he was impressed by my talent as an artist it looked like it was drawn by a five-year-old but I could tell what it was supposed to be and I loved the concept Kettle grip is a portable dumbbell adapter that allows you to do all of your favorite kettlebell exercises anywhere you can find a dumbbell simply open the kettle grip and certainly any dumbbell secure the latch and you're ready for your Kettle grip workout clever Kettle grit is great for swings upright rows overhead presses flexibility and range of motion we are seeking a 300 000 investment for 10 equity in our company so sharks who's ready to get a grip but um in front of you you'll find a kettle grip and a dumbbell feel free to pick it up and check it out and we just put it in put the dumbbell inside close the two handles to secure the latch put your palm on the logo and rock your hand forward [Music] great job Robert here we go you gave me the heavy one because you and you all right it's just easy yeah straightforward Mark how heavy is yours Kevin this is how it's done Lori I see that actually it's not but really clever idea there's a lot of exercises you just can't safely do with a dumbbell Andy I have to tell you it actually felt better than a kettlebell we agree they kind of crunch your hands when you do it this has a very comfortable what's the max weight what's the max dumbbell that you could use right now it's rated to hold up to 55 pounds 55 with no problem okay so why is this worth three million dollars three hundred thousand for ten percent you better have a ton of sales guys we do have sales our lifetime sales are 3.6 million dollars let's go through the years 2018 we sold 391 000. okay 2019 590 2020 in 2020 when covet hit gems closed down the demand for personal fitness equipment skyrocketed our 2020 sales 1.9 million 21. year to date we've sold 680 000 and we're going to finish the year at 1 million in sales right now 92 percent of our sales come from Online Marketplace are you in sales or kind of a spokesperson something going on here never I it was a 20-year Marine Corps helicopter pilot thank you for your service what kind of helicopters I flew the cobra attack helicopter in the Marine Corps with multiple deployments by Iraq and Afghanistan man wow so you're a badass just doing my job yeah it was an honor but the cobra attack helicopter is a bad machine yeah oh yeah what's your background Annie and I have been good friends since high school after that I moved out to San Diego California where I opened multiple ice cream stores and for 20 years was the ice cream king of Mission Beach so guys what do they sell for and what do they cost you to make it costs 6.57 cents to make and we sell for 34.95 81 margin that's a good margin a lot of people are really into fitness will buy a whole set of dumbbells and then they'll buy a separate set of candles saving you it's it's making it super convenient ourselves on your product and where are you manufacturing pedal grip is 100 made in the USA good for you do you have a patent on this you bet we do Lori I figured grip me our Utility Patent protects integrating the closure into the handle is the only dumbbell to kettlebell converter with redundant safety features and So within four years you've had how many knockoffs there's approximately two to three but they're not nearly as successful as we are but what are they pricing at they are cheaper but they're lower quality if you buy one it's lower quality and not nearly as safe you guys did 1.9 million last year yes sir with 81 margins so why are you here yeah we are looking to make a deal with a shark because we need a strategic partner to help us make connections into new marketplaces we have not been able to get in Big Box why are they not returning your car why are they not saying yes Dan and I are not marketers we have gotten really good at production I got a couple of million dollars worth of sale to say that you may be better marketers than you think yeah right yeah what are you talking about and you're selling a million dollars one unit at a time we've sold lifetime 106 000 Kettle excuse me trucks 106 000. we have now sold 106 000. we just keep selling these things but wait there's more don't wait there's more and what's the number now 106 000 and five cattle trucks you're amazing guys Take the Money and Run keep going as long as you can um as an investable business to grow beyond that I I don't see that it's not an investment for me I'm out thank you Robert I have always admired your hair yeah so guys the challenge I have is that your secondary product you have to have somebody who already has dumbbells that means you're limited in the number of consumers that you can have so for those Reasons I'm out Mark if you change your mind we will take you back are you familiar with my PRX gym deal we have seen that so guys listen I'll make you an offer I'm in this space in a big way PRX is way bigger than you and that's great and we learned a lot in terms of how we did social I've got a great team on that we built that business direct to Consumer if you want to go to retail I have no problem luckily I'm a shark everybody returns my call I'll do the 300 000 for 20 percent [Music] it's an interesting offer Mr Wonderful and we would love to work with you out of respect for the other sharks exactly that's fine Damon Laurie what do you guys want to do oh Laura you've been quiet over there I have been quiet I'm sitting here thinking I'm just blown away at your sales help you sell it to to retail to a much broader Market internationally and all of that but I was just wondering if I wanted to be in the conversion list you can't even lift it up but I could lift it up I use free weights every day so so I think a lot of women do you know and I think that the Market's really interesting all right I'm going to give you a creative offer um I'll give you the 300 000 for 20 but I would like to do it as preferred stock which means that I would get distribution first whenever there's profits that are paid out I can help you make so much more money that you wouldn't mind that at all because everybody'd be making money right could you bring that down to 15 percent [Music] you got a deal there you go [Music] I think women really like this this seems like a really smart converter okay congratulations too you know what I mean you should have jumped in quicker we'll never know what happened but congratulations congratulations guys thank you Lori was our Dream shark we cannot wait to work with her we don't have any experience in marketing and that's what she does so it's sky's the limit for Kettle grip ", "Ade + Ayo": "next up is a fashion brand that celebrates African heritage [Music] [Music] [Applause] hi sharks I'm Timmy Dayo and I'm abisola we're from Oakland California and we're here seeking 175 thousand dollars for 10 of our company as Nigerian immigrants we value keeping strong ties with our heritage so it's no wonder when we were having our baby boy we wanted to make sure he grew up enriched by Nigerian culture as well and one way we do the Sharks is by heaven afrobeat dance parties come on you guys are gonna dance [Music] Oh Mr Wonderful am I right yeah but when we went out to look for clothing books and toys that would help our son take pride in his roots the options were very limited that's why we created we bring the joy and vibrancy of African cultures to Children through products that are beautiful thoughtful we're talking about you the first to bring African prints to organic cotton fabric that are soft machine washable and perfect for everyday play with distinct patterns and colors that are inspired by African textiles sharks representation matters what kids in their lives every day helps them to understand what the world looks like and shapes their views about the future yes so oil white youth sharks to join us in fill in homes across the world with awe-inspiring African Artistry in front of each of you are your very own day now pieces check out for yourselves have a look so you each staff thank you you each have pieces from our BOGO collection I think it'll fit me too this is cute this is inspired by Malayan mud cloth fabrics and then Barbara what you have is the tequila print and that is inspired by a Congolese fabric called Kuba cloth you want to know something as I was touching this there's an incredible softness to it this normal cotton feels starchy right you know like stiff and kind of yeah organic cotton actually it has a beautiful feel really cute that really was a priority for us I wanted my son to be able to play in these clothes and to feel comfortable wearing them as part of his everyday life so the way the fabric feel is a very important part of what we're doing I will say we've seen so many collections for children over the years on Shark Tank but never anything like this ever each of the prints we hold are also sophisticated they feel like designer clothing thank you plan for distribution on this stuff so we are focused on our direct to customer Channel through our website and how's it going over 11 months we've been running now and our sales are really really strong they're showing up at wandering 60k and what does the average cost to make it and when you sell it at it takes about six dollars to make 19 retail to sell you sell this Fidelity is so I really want the average person to be able to purchase these and that's why you're sticking to direct to Consumer because you need those margins right so can you tell us a little bit about you about your background so I was actually an attorney before doing this but I also wanted it as I began to do that job that I had to draw to something else and I found myself tinkering ideas outside of work and I knew at some point I was going to come across an idea that I was going to have to build out and that's what this is right he has a supply chain background and get to that thank you um so my background is in I have an engineering degree and an MBA at Yale where I'm at my beautiful wife and then after that like I have a 15-year career where I've worked at Amazon and also at Apple but both the retail and the consumer side so in terms of who we actually are right so I was four years old my family moved from Nigeria to Montreal Canada and my parents began from scratch they were washing bathrooms they were mine Cooks my parents wake me up in the wee hours of the morning shovel me into their car and we would go around and distribute newspapers so they were really hustling and they went from that to earning multiple degrees and having their own businesses watching that growing up just ignited me a belief in the power of a dream and a vision and putting everything you can into making it happen are you doing this full-time we are both full-time but you're only doing 15K a month in sales and obviously not all that is income um how are you guys surviving we were able to save some money and sort of invest our funds into their companies 175 000 for won't you use our money what would you hope a shark would do we're going to invest a lot of it into the product you mean inventory exactly yes inventory the other part is we're in our team we want to grow our team to be able to Market get the message out to people in creative ways I think we need implementers so we have really wonderful strategies and ideas particularly on the marketing side and it's really a matter of like we are two people and so they're only so many hours of the day to get that work actually done so at this juncture in the business do you think it was wise for both of you to give up high paying jobs I mean you're all in here if this doesn't work out this is a bad hour We're very confident there's no reason why this shouldn't work out it's a binary outcome either it works or it doesn't if it doesn't work you guys are screwed we are bidding on ourselves right every entrepreneur bets on themselves right right that's the nature right but why such a high valuation I mean right now you're asking 175 000 for 10 if you distributed a hundred thousand dollars a year and I made 10 of that that's ten thousand dollars a year I would have it would take me 17 years to get my money back do you understand what you're asking the way we see the value of the company of today is based on the potential you said today right yes not potential you said today what is the value of the company today we see based on the traction we have so far we think we can grow to that um well you can make it you can make up your own don't you think the business is going to grow that's why they're here I'm already giving them three to four times more today I'm asking an honest question I mean Mark how are you going to get your money back I mean that's it's a good question position is four times sales six times except when you're when you're relatively small unique students at a 1.7 million value on this one I'm sure they're going to negotiate there's no real formula out there we're all making it exactly exactly anyways I was going to say clothing is not my thing I like to dig into things I add a lot of value in and I don't think this is one of them so I'm out yeah guys I'm kind of in the same boat the accelerant that you need has done the details and the operational elements of and that's just not my strong suit for clothing so for those Reasons I'm out my feeling here is I don't agree with your vision of what to do with the money I was listening carefully because I could have gone either way I don't think that you should be hiring on staff at all and I think you can Outsource the needs that you have you can hire somebody in marketing and not have to pay a salary and not have to train and deal with all of that instead pay them for what they do I wish you the best but unfortunately I'm out Here's my thought on you know I love your product but the amount that you're asking for is so much that I would associate right so I know but what I would have to ask I wouldn't even be happy being a partner asking for that much because now I'm taking 50 of your dream so without reason I'm out [Music] there's still one shark left Barbara you underestimate yourself I don't think you realize the potential you have here I see it right I have not seen baby clothing with these cool designs the fabric when you said they sell for under 20 bucks I was blown away targets should be carrying a line immediately okay so I think you're going to grow like gangbusters but I also think you're underestimating what you're going to need to do it biggest danger is underestimating how successful you could be and what you're going to need to get there you need me because I've done it before right that's why I'm going to give you an aggressive a greedy offer okay let's share it let's hear it four sharks around Barbara is interested in temodayo and abisola's African inspired children's clothing company a day and IO but she requires a much bigger stake than the 10 they came in offering your biggest danger is underestimating how successful you could be and what you're going to need to get there you need me because I've done it before right that's why I'm going to give you an aggressive a greedy offer okay let's share it so I'm going to give you 175 000 I'd like to take a third of your business but I'm going to also give you a 500 000 credit line which you're going to really need and you're going to need it faster than you think Barbara we can tell that you get it honestly um there is so much potential here and 33 is high for us it's 33. so yeah that's higher than we would like to go you're 66 and two-thirds percent is worth far far more with Barbara so rather than that number you had coming in here that you thought you couldn't go above because everybody who stands on that carpet does the exact same thing and the biggest winners are the ones that don't nickel and dime the valuation told us who owns your business so she becomes a third partner equal to you we're thinking if we could do going up a little bit on the dollar amount to 200 000 and then still having line of credit and then we could do at that amount we could do is it 30 yeah we could do 30 percent [Music] um I will take that deal but I need 33 and a third percent I want to feel equal to you and remember I'm coming with a lot more than you came in here asking for you got more money and you're equivalent over three to third percent I mean you're gonna make so much money what are you gonna do foreign [Music] we accept that deal thank you so much [Music] whoa baby [Music] thank you guys so much I love these people and I love that clothing I think it's gonna work you got a good one I think it's gonna work a 20 price point that's fantastic that's a high evaluation ", "Behave Bras": "foreign next in the tank is a support system for an underserved Market hi sharks my name is Athena kazvikis I'm from Boston Massachusetts and I'm seeking 150 000 for 15 percent of my company behave for us so sharks I grew up in a big Greek family and I always felt supported but I developed a problem actually two big problems I developed large breasts at a young age and they just destroyed my back and my neck and my shoulders I used to have to wear not one not two three sports bras just to play soccer like and keep the girls in place without losing an eye and I am not alone there are 50 million women today in the United States with large breasts struggling to find support and comfortable options that's why I developed patent-pending stays technology that you can only find on a behaved bra because I know from personal experience large breasts need a lot more than just lift let me show you how it works so stays are stretchy pieces of fabric and they live in the cup of every behave bra they encapsulate each breast and ensure that both of the girls are staying in their assigned seats they're kind of like a soft seat belt but for your bust and stays are so secure that they keep you supported even if you go sideways so stays get rid of boob smash boob jiggle and boob sweat and they are a huge reason my customers tell me behave bras is not just the most supportive thing in the bra drawer but it's also the most beautiful so you guys have behaved bras in front of you and I really am super excited to show you the product I have a quick question so I'm holding up this one here and you were talking about out the stays is this the stay that is the stay the stage so it's almost like an underlining back here but it twists that's right it's a very obvious non-obvious construction you get a little twist so that it can form a pocket and catch each breath and you walk us through the sizing I'm not familiar with the largest girl how big would that be we offer sizing right now between a 30 and a 38 a double D to top and so I know that sounds large but Double D is the average brush size today in the United States wow and is I the largest I know breasts go all the way up the alphabet from A to Z yes wow don't they use a wire in them and things of that nature right and this is more supportive than even those with the wire yeah so wire is the fastest sorry wire free the fast growing segment of the entire lingerie industry kovitz just accelerated that and why don't you like wire at the end of a 16-hour day wires can feel like a torture device that you want to burn even if they fit properly well you mean they're just uncomfortable this is a wire I guess of sorts but it feels totally soft and very bendable it almost just feels like fabric are you calling this a new kind of wire and does it lend that same kind of uplift to a bra so yes I think what you're also feeling is the padded straps which that is coming from customer feedback that was something that women wanted to answer your question my whole goal like the Utopia for a bra is to design something for the heaviest brass it's like a skyscraper and keep that supported and uplifted so what's your background that you figured this out so I'm Greek and Italian and in my family you have an A or you have a g cup that's really all we get in my family and so when I developed brass I was very athletic and I really struggled and I was a brand manager on some of the largest brands at Procter Gamble and I loved it I left Proctor to go work for startups and learned how to basically start a company with zero dollars can you tell us some about the business absolutely I'm gonna go right down the list launched in 2020. we you have a hundred and ten thousand dollars in sales in 18 months okay we have margins of 87 on the bras and 83 on the panty wow we are killing are you only direct to Consumer it's only through our website today and what is the sale price the retail price you get a lot of returns you know what we don't we have one of the lowest return rates for online laundry industry average is 20 to 40 percent we're at 12. average for 18 months wow Athena what is the game plan is it to blow it up direct to Consumer keep these 80 plus percent margins absolutely because we own our consumer and she's already loyal we own the most valuable and fastest growing segment of lingerie out there today so she spends more money than A's B's C's or D's because she's in so much need it is the biggest white space she will buy anything she thinks can solve a problem and so I would at this moment we are building something larger than just technology we're building a brand do you have patents on this we are patent pending um but what we've patented is the entire garment and it's under a breast support garment because stays aren't just for bras stays are for swimmers stays are for sports bras and pajamas and anything that supports a breast in any way shape or form we're going to get our patent in two weeks I think you're very impressive I love this deal and I want to be part of keeping breasts behaved so you know I'll give you the 150 000 for 20 wow that's a quick deal you want to know something that is unusual that is a rare that is a rarity like I listen I I think you're going to pull this off and I there can't be a better spokesperson for this than me Mr Wonderful wants to keep all this stuff controlled I think together we would be a very interesting team I think they do let's do this deal done would you consider wow 150 thousand dollars or 17. Athena what is your largest obstacle right now um the largest obstacle right now is living off my savings for two years so I moved back home with Mama Bear who's like amazing but I buy used clothing if I need it use sneakers to go running like everything I have is in this business um because I believe in it Athena you have a really good offer on the table Yeah listen I'm just curious I mean you only countered him with a three percent difference what are you gonna say back for Kevin I have heard great things about Mr Wonderful oh my gosh they're all too impossible I swear to you and then take my deal and let's get going I don't want a 20 is great because I'll tell you why it's such a strange you know partnership people are going to say what is this what do you want to do would you be willing to go for 150 000 for 17 no I'm worth 20. you know the difference is so small in the long run it's not going to matter I'm betting on you and I'm going to promote you because I think you're terrific and get this I grew up in Cyprus so I'm very well aware of where your name came from you're from Greek mythology what do you want to do you want to do the deal or not I want to do the deal congratulations great job guys I would have never thought I'd invest in this never never why not congratulations perfect it's gonna be great all right thank you very much well done I feel like we just won the lottery and Mr Wonderful is amazing like he's so amazing and I am so ready for someone like him to help me blow up behave ", "Curie": "first in the tank is a product that is natural and effective [Music] hey sharks my name is Sarah Moray I'm from Los Angeles California and I'm seeking 300 000 for five percent equity in my company sharks we spend thousands of dollars on fancy lotions and potions and skin care products yet completely neglect one of the most sensitive vulnerable parts of our skin talking about our armpits do you think about what you put on your pits every day I didn't until I learned that most conventional antiperspirants are made out of this and I didn't want this going on my body sure I tried natural deodorants but they all either irritated my skin or left me smelling like a human gym bag and that's why I created Curie an aluminum free deodorant that actually works made with luxury Skin Care Quality ingredients say goodbye to embarrassing Bo ugly bumps and painful rashes and say hello to perfect pits Kira uses Sage oil and probiotics to beat the stink arrowroot powder to absorb the sweat and chamomile and aloe to soothe those delicate pits and it doesn't stop there curie's line of Better Body Basics also includes our full body deodorant spray whipped body wash and Innovative pit detox mask all our products are made with clean ingredients smell amazing and they actually work don't believe me I'm in the Shark Tank right now and my armpits are completely dry Kevin go and smell them I don't know sharks who wants to help me build my armpit Empire in front of you we have one of each of our products in each of our three signature scents uh Lori and Barbara white tea is our fan favorite on QVC with that scent the orange Neroli for the men that is the most gender neutral the most popular with our male customers there are two types of deodorants that we sell you have all of them in front of you the Stick deodorant and the spray deodorant spray deodorant is actually our number one best-selling product fisherman that is in locker rooms hundreds of gyms Nationwide we started with the Stick deodorant we got approached by a big National Fitness chain but you can't share a stick of deodorant so we developed the spray deodorant so that it could be shareable I'd love to know your total sales our first year in business 2019 Curie was a side hustle I totally bootstrapped that first year to 125 000 in sales while I still had a full-time job it was 20. before you get to your next year to do 125 000 in your first year in a single product is not easy so there must have been some Secret Sauce something you did that really drove those sales social media okay it's huge for us are you making any money yet right now we are not profitable I raised a round of funding beginning of 2020 we raised a million dollars on a convertible note and so at the moment we're really investing in growth but we we have plans to be profitable by end of year beginning of next what was the raise at we did a convertible no at a five million dollar cap what's your profit margin on the deodorant stick that retails for twelve dollars it's a 270 cost the spray deodorant retails for 14 it's 290. the body care products have a little bit higher margins around 8 85 percent but the deodorants are between 75 and 80. I gotta tell you something you are spot on with your numbers this is impressive the way that you can roll I know I know it's going to guess your background I got out of college and I worked at a venture capital fund very entry-level job at a top BC fund uh as you know there are very few women investors I think it's like less than five percent of VCS are females and so I knew if I wanted to have a seat at the table I had to take it I literally started just showing up at pitch meetings plopping down and people would be like what is Sarah from accounting doing here started to raise my hand grew the confidence and started to really add value earn myself a full-time role on the investment team and did that for about four years meeting with hundreds of entrepreneurs and seeing them on the other side of the table and being like there's no difference between me and them really all they had was the guts to like go out there and make it happen good for you so I went out I had this idea started with a personal need and was like screw it what's the worst that happens so 2019 first year bootstrapped had a full-time job did 125 in sales second year was 2020 we did seven hundred thousand dollars whoa this year we are on track to do two million dollars in sales that's not bad did you do any type of Laboratory Testing that shows efficacy of the deodorant we have not yet they're really pricey all of our ingredients have been tested for safety tested for efficacy by the manufacturers of the ingredients so that was um sufficient for the claims that we wanted to do a Powerhouse sir I get it I get it this just isn't my space you know it's not a product that Mr Wonderful is going to get behind because I don't add a lot of value to it I don't think you're worth six million bucks but anyways I'm not going to fight you about it I'm out thank you yeah in terms of evaluation I usually don't care but there's not nothing that just hits me over the face saying there there's there's that hockey stick coming for sure I think for sure I can tell you the hockey stick is coming because those gyms last month we put our products in every single soul cycle Nationwide and starting two weeks ago and we are seeing a conversion essentially zero pack aside from the product costs all those gyms you've got to convert fast because your cash to do that is going to be significant and that's exactly why we're raising money it's just hard for me to quantify that as an investor so for those reasons specifically you'd like for me to quantify no because it's still uncertain right but coming in at a six million dollar valuation even if we negotiate some because you're totally open to negotiating I here to negotiate please give this woman three hundred thousand dollars I'm out Sarah I'm sorry a deal so all I need is the connection yes Barbara I think you're the whole package I mean you've got it all all right thank you Barbara um but what I don't want to make a deal uh I'll tell you what I would make a deal with you uh if you hadn't done one thing that I think is a fatal error which has raised money too early and it scares me how quickly you're moving how enthusiastic you are how many excuse you have there how you can do this how you can do that it's almost an overconfidence that can get you in trouble but unfortunately for that reason alone I'm out I you know I have to say I agree with Barb I feel that when you raise a lot of money fast and you start getting into so many skus it winds up you get in trouble if you had come in with some great efficacy numbers I would have been in for all of these Reasons I'm sorry I wish you good luck but I'm out thank you Lori now there's one shark left Damon yeah I'm on the fence about this how do you like the valuation I don't like evaluation at all but if you want us to get up and go to work at five percent that's challenging I'll give you three hundred thousand for twenty percent twenty percent is a lot we came here wanting to give up I yeah it's a lot less than I want to take too but would you be open to doing three hundred thousand dollars for twelve percent we are not starting at the starting line what do you think a shark premium is what do you think it should be worth I think us I would be giving a significant shark premium for 12 I have gotten this business here essentially On My Own by hustle and hard work that's why you have an offer I don't think there was any other product she's amazing but the deodorant it's a great price just all the other stuff I'm not sure I have the hustle I came here you guys I was hiking on Griffith Observatory two hours ago I literally was hiking Griffith Observatory sweating in the hot hot sun and I came here because I wanted to focus on him offer oh oh no are you sure wait you got you got a call two hours ago two hours ago that deserves an offer what do you say two of us together yeah that's a lucky sign that never happens Mark Barbara the 300K for 14. how about 400k for 14. what you're worried about is the conversion number right yes so two percent in advisory shares okay so 12 300 000 12 Equity two percent advisory shares that you issue after the deal and the note converts foreign [Music] okay I what are you waiting for would you be willing to do 300 000 for 10 and four percent advisor shares I want to minimize my dilution are you guys interested yes we have a deal done two hours ago you were hiking in a mountain and now you made a deal and I will say I didn't even shower I used our deodorant spray and I smell amazing right now so the product works it doesn't smell like orange strolling it smells great two hours ago I know that's impressive my gosh that's impressive congratulations all right eighteen percent I've been a solo entrepreneur through a pandemic and it's been really lonely and hard and having people like them to to help me like get to the business to the like next level is like amazing ", "NOGGIN Boss": "next up is a unique

attended golf tournament in the world and it was a huge success we Then followed into spring training and as we all know the entire world and our supply chain shut down for about a year and a half but we use that time to hustle and we got on phone calls with buyers for both promotional teams and for licensed teams and it paid off in huge dividends we were actually recently featured in the NFL draft we also in the NBA Finals we got so much attention that even the NBA commissioner asked to meet us at one of the games and was given a noggin during that session you're stating like there's massive amount of interest but you only have 30 000 worth of sales the main reason why we're here is because we're on WE unfortunately can't fulfill 95 percent of our orders because they want a licensed logo yeah and so we're here to act to find a partner that understands how to navigate those otters and so that we can accelerate did you get any kind of offer if you could figure it out we haven't no honestly we just relaunched this business our supply chain wasn't able to fulfill so we had to pull back until we were ready to go full how much are you making the half for and how much you're selling it for so landed is is twenty dollars whoa and we're retailing it for sixty five dollars whoa we've actually sold the hats at events for over a hundred dollars and we've had some Charities actually auction them off for over a thousand so how did you come up with this idea so the idea was born when my daughter and I entered a Best Dressed golfers competition and I wore a large hat that everybody loved and when I got home we made a few prototypes and tried it out at a few events and the response was so positive that we knew we just had to do this now did you approach any owners such as Mark because they can sell in their own Arenas have you approached anybody yet like that we haven't been able to get through to those individuals but again at the NBA Finals our exposure was Unreal over 40 of these Noggins into the finals why would you sneak 40 of these ends that's what was amazing I had two giant trash bags my wife didn't believe that it was going to happen and we got him in you got in with trash bags with trash bags in which city in Phoenix he's secured as tight as a whistle wow so you need a shark to open doors for you that's why you're here because you're not asking for a lot of money we wanted to show that we are here to do a deal we did not want to put you guys off with all these granders that these could be the sales we can't tell you when we wear these hats and when we see people wear them you're giving away a million smiles and the amount of people that walk up to you and they want to take their picture with you it unites people like no other you guys have the manufacturing Logistics nailed down we do we're actually able to scale and one of the things that we pivoted during this whole season was to figure out local production which was very hard but we now have the proprietary equipment but are you making these in the USA or are you making because you just said you got some expensive equipment that's the confusing point or is that for the embroidery embroidery so we're doing customization here locally oh all right okay so what does it cost just for the Hat without the embroidery around twelve dollars okay just for the Hat yeah okay so you have a patent on this you know we've trademarked and trade named everything that we can but you don't have a patent right well it's probably not patented I know yeah I know but I mean the concern Becomes of another company says let's turn on that switch because they already have yeah they're only going to turn on the switch if they're already big right and there's a market there one of our biggest advantages we feel is that we have speed to Market yeah and we're already here we're ready to go we've seen the proof of concept go because this is probably a sub license of a person who already has the prices yeah for hats yeah yeah so what he's saying is you could go to somebody who already has a MBA license for hats and just sub licens it really easily and that's why we're here we genuinely want somebody that understands that space that can help us navigate those deals because you really only get one shot I'll give you 50 000 for 30 percent Bingo and you know what if you do that deal with Damon I'll get you into the Mavs um the hangers what we call it where we sell merchandise so you could put Mavs on there and we'll you know bring 10 in or whatever see if they sell and I'll make it easy for you this isn't something for me so I'm out but I think he gave you a great offer I'll give you fifty thousand dollars for 30 just take it right now wait wait let me make it don't wait wait careful wait I'd like to make an offer guys hey guys I'm trying to talk over here please yes it's the opportunity to see the other offers you know what you're gonna get right now let's just do it why wait a second Damon why can't they hear other offers they can't hear other offers let me speak Damon you got a deal good there you go all right there you go all right hey thank you thank you appreciate it thank you congratulations guys thank you thank you thank you let's go all right sharks baby incredible um we know that Damon understands the challenges and understands the context to get us in the places that we need to be so we're excited for those doors just to get knocked wide open and we're excited for the world to get their hands on Noggin boss and love those guys those guys are great I love this thing I think it's very cool I didn't sell a ton of these we will sell a bunch now we'll have to deal with people complaining take the hat off I can't see anything ", "Chapul": "[Music] My name is Pat Crowley. I live in beautiful Salt Lake City, Utah. And I'm the founder of Chupool. As an environmentalist, I'm very concerned about the future of our planet. And so that's what inspired me to create an eco-friendly energy bar. Right now, we work in a very small kitchen and we make all the bars by hand. Our product is the first of its kind in the world. It contains an extremely healthy, sustainable form of protein that we like to refer to as our secret ingredient. Hello, Chapul. This is Pat speaking. We're growing every month and we can't keep up with demand. We need an investment from the Sharks to increase our production and get the word out about our amazing product. Yeah, stoked on the new design. It looks good. Starting to pool has been a challenge. People have called us crazy and said that the idea would never work. Wanting a deal today goes well beyond my desire for personal success. I want to propel this protein as the food of the future. [Music] [Applause] [Music] My name is Pat Crowley from Salt Lake City, Utah. My company is Chapul and I'm asking $50,000 in exchange for 5% equity of our company. At Chapul, we're changing the way people think about food, and we do it with an energy bar. But what separates us from the thousands of competitors isn't the delicious melee dates or the organic dark chocolate. No, it's our sustainable, eco-friendly form of protein that goes into every single bar. I'll show you, but first, a joke. Why are frogs so happy? Why? Why? Because they eat what bugs them. And now so can you with Chipool Cricket bars? [Music] Oh, you got to be kidding. Crickets are an extremely sustainable form of protein. They go into each one of our bars. Oh, insects are eaten in over half the countries around the globe. And we think it's about time that Americans catch up with the rest of the world. There is no way I'm eating that. All right. We have a Thailand themed coconut ginger lime. This one? Yep. Aztec bar is dark chocolate coffee cayenne. And then we have an all American peanut butter and chocolate. Why not? Right. They're crickets, not cockroaches. Correct. We actually make a flower out of the crickets, so you won't see any legs or antennas. You first. Must we eat it? Sure. You're obviously jumping at the opportunity here to get on board with a growing global business. So, who wants to join Chapul and help us to feed the revolution? You realize that there's a huge barrier. absolutely around this product. Some very large percentage of consumers are going to be revolted because in our North American society, they don't eat insects. I'm not saying it's good or bad, they just don't. I agree. So, what I'm trying to determine cuz I'm trying to be pragmatic, I'm happy to invest in it if I can make money. Sure. So, we modeled our energy bar after the sushi industry. 30 years ago, eating raw fish was completely repulsive to Americans and until a man by the name of Mashidita craftly developed the California rule. And it was a gentle introduction. And so that's what we're doing with our energy. That took 20 years. Tell talk about sales. Okay. So we to date we have uh $50,000 in sales and this year we're averaging 33% increase month overmonth revenue. So over what period of time did you sell 50,000? That's in just under a year. Where are you in retail? Natural food stores, bike shops, uh rock climbing gyms, CrossFit gyms. Are you saying it's worth a million dollars? Absolutely. But why can't I just get my own crickets and make my own bars? We we've spent a lot of time developing the supply chain and working with the FDA and we're the only ones right now with a insectbased nutritional product on the market. Only one that can sell cricket bars. We're the only ones doing it. The one bar, what do you sell it for? $2.99. And to make it, it costs about a dollar. Where do you get your crickets? Do you grow them yourself? You catch them? We work We work with a cricket ranch, actually. They have little they have little lassos cricket brands. Where is their cricket red? We've been raising crickets in the in the United States for over 100 years. It was based on why fishing bait. Then it was reptile feed. And now that was one of the reasons we chose crickets is because the infrastructure is already in place to grow them at a large scale. Are cricket farms enclosed? They are. And that that's one of the environmental benefits is that you can grow them in a warehouse and it's significantly fewer acres to grow more protein. I'm interested in how they meet their end. You put them in a blender and they stay to the side so they fall down and gets fried. What happens? We freeze them. That's about the best way to go. So it's it actually their natural metabolism just slows down. Pat, what does this replace? Like do I eat this and it's half the size of a normal bar? A bar with other allnatural and organic ingredients, right, would have half the protein that that does. So you grind your crickets up into flour. Our name Chapul is actually an Aztec word for cricket cuz they would do the same thing. They would gather crickets, blend them up into a flour, and make a protein dense bread. Look, I got to tell you, I'm I'm a pretty brave guy, but snakes, bugs, freak me right out. So there's no way I'm eating this stuff. Thank you. I'm out. Let's let's talk about the crickets because you didn't tell the whole cricket story. The truth about crickets are that they are considered a very important insect in many countries around the world. They're considered lucky. For example, in China, people think it's incredibly unlucky to kill one, even accidentally. How do you know that? Listen, I'm Mr. Wonderful. I know everything. It's considered really bad karma to kill them, let alone freeze them. You got a whole bunch of crickets right here. They're not chirping cuz they sense danger. That's what they sense. I agree. You're They know they're going to die a horrible death with you. I just think in this case, those crickets are telling me to stay out of this deal. I'm out. I have to hand it to you. I ate that and it tastes great. I can't tell the difference. And I'm relieved to find out that that crunch that's on my tongue are not the legs or the crickets and all that kind of creepy stuff. I think it's going to be a heck of a long journey uh to convince people that they're going to love to bite into something with crickets in it. I just think it is. And whenever there's a long journey in a business, it means it cost you more money to get there. I'm out. We we've been very concerted in our growth right now. We've been intentionally trying to fly under the radar to some degree unsuccessfully. We've been in national international publications because of this. I can't wrap my head around this. I spent most of my life trying to get away from bugs. Uh, not even. So, I'm sorry. I'm out. [Music] All right, let's do this, Mark. Let's do this. Okay, Jiminy. With the work you've done to create Cricut Flower, you're basically saying there's no competition at all. There's a couple of upand cominging companies. What are they doing compared to you guys? What are they using for flour? They don't have a product yet. They've asked us to sell to them and we're we're debating right now whether we should actually do that. And why what's the debate? Our business model is not to invest in infrastructure. And so I'd prefer to purchase the flower at some point if I could and just be the brand behind the insect movement. I thought my understanding was you own the flower, right? That you created it. You're no one else has this flower but you. Correct. From an FDA perspective, you're the only one that's approved. Correct. So why not have go to these other guys and say, \"Okay, we'll sell you our flower at, you know, three times what it costs us to make, but you have to brand it made with Chapul flour.\" That's what that's why I say we're we're on the fence and that's what we're going to do if we decide to sell the Why wouldn't you do that? It's a great idea. I got to tell you, the longer you're talking, the more I realize you you have a great business, but the business is the flower. The business is not the energy bar. Come on back in. Four sharks are out, but Robert may have had a change of heart. I got to tell you, the longer you're talking, the more I realize you you have a great business, but the business is the flower. The business is not the energy bar. The business is the flower. come on back in. We do have a lot of people saying, \"When are you going to sell the flower? When are you going to sell the flower?\" One reason I've held off on doing that is that I'm my passion is the sustainability of our food systems. I love the fact that you're exclusive. You have no competition. I mean, yeah, it's great. I'd like to be able to help you, but it's not worth my time for 5%. I'll be happy to take more money. I could do that for you if you want. Oh, really? That is so generous of you, but it doesn't work for me, right? Sell me. Yeah. Okay. So, we're protecting $150,000 in sales. I'm I'm We're past that, right? We're negotiating. Like I'm saying, we are at the brink. We're on the whole He's past all that. He now we're negotiating. All right. You want me to come back with another offer? You got to make it crooked sweet for him. Make me an offer. All right. So I I know what it takes to lead a team and I need to maintain complete ownership. So I need to maintain 51% to lead the team that I have. Okay. So you have other investors, not investors but uh employees founders found that have equity that have I have 80%. You have 80%. I have 80%. Right. So [Music] let's do 10%. Make me an offer. This is going to be a half a million dollar business in the next 5 years. With any luck at all, you might show a profit before you're dead. 15% I could do tomorrow. Are you nuts, Pat? I'll give you the 50,000 for 20%. Will somebody jump back in? I'll do it for the 15%. 15%. Yep. Let's go make some chirping money. Let's do this, Marty. Thank you very much. He snapped that one from some crickets. Yeah, let's eat some crickets. Good job, man. Thank you very much. Robert, here's your consolation prize. Oh, don't come. I definitely gave away more equity than I wanted, but now that Mark is one of our partners, we can't be more excited to just take this to the next level and really feed the revolution. You cost me 5%. I'm not going to let you live that down. I'm going to get that back. You're trying to get 20 out of me. Yeah. Yeah. But Robert ruined that for you. They are so ugly. ", "Do Amore": "next up is a business that adds more meaning to one of the most meaningful purchases someone can make [Music] hi sharks my name is Krishna matramka and I'm from Houston Texas my company do Amore is improving one of the oldest traditions in the world sharks many of you have shopped for engagement or wedding rings before but looking back what do you remember about that ring maybe the story was from the carrot weight maybe how much you spent but what if your life-changing day could have changed another life forever that's exactly what do Amore does not only do we create some of the most sustainable rings in the world using recycled precious metals and ethically sourced stones but we take it one step further every dolomore ring gives a person in a developing country access to clean water this way a couple can change another life forever on their special day with each ring our customers are literally helping to solve one of the most pressing problems in the world today so how does it work sharks it's simple just visit our website and design the perfect ring for your loved one and when you're ready just check out and we'll begin making your ring right here in the USA and when you receive your ring you and your partner can see the specific impact that your ring made you can pull up a photo and the GPS coordinates of the actual water well you helped build along with information on the community that now has access to clean water clean water changes everything we've already built water projects in nine countries and the list keeps growing so sharks for six hundred thousand dollars in exchange for six percent of my company which one of you would like to be my partner and say yes to my proposal presentation thank you is this simply a situation where you take a percentage of your profits Target a community that needs fresh water and send the money there to do the work so the way it works is whether you're buying a 250 wedding band or a 25 000 engagement ring every ring is one person access to water over the last few years 20.5 percent of our net profits have gone towards it on average it's about fifty dollars per ring you're burdening your business with a 20 tax basically but there must be a reason you're doing that other than just the reason the reason is my story like when I was younger my family and I moved to India and we were walking to school one day and we saw a large crowd gather around a lady that was crying the little boy was laying in his mom's arms and he had died from the Bad Bunny or the bad water that he and his family had to drink every single day and this image has stayed in my head for a really long time later as an engineer I went to work in the middle of nowhere to help drill oil wells and very quickly I learned it takes weeks and weeks to get to oil but you hit water within minutes this bothered me because there are literally people and children dying from not having clean water when the clean water is a hundred yards beneath their feet around the same time I was shopping for engagement rings and I was really troubled at these symbols of love came with questions of Ethics so I thought when I proposed what if I could do it with a ring that didn't just not hurt the world but actually helped the world how do you Source the diamonds ethically so all of our natural diamonds we're only sourcing them if we're a hundred percent sure they're from an ethical mind and by that you mean that the labor is treated well that the conditions of mining are good correct or we do lab-created diamonds the lab created Market is booming even the Rings you're seeing they're made from recycled precious metal recycled gold recycled Platinum so how long ago was this when did you start the company so I left my job in 2013. I had saved up 18 000 I put every single dollar into starting the company 2014 was my first year working on this full-time yeah let's do it so last year we did 8.3 million dollars in sales this year we'll be doing 11 and a half million dollars in sales what did you make what did you make on the 8.3 what are you going to make this year on the 11th so we've already done 5.2 this year so far to date and we've netted 460 000 cash flow positive on the okay what about it did you make money on the 8.3 last year we do um it was a little bit less than a hundred thousand what do you charge for let's say a two carat Solitaire sure so yours is very close to two carat is about two and a half your engagement ring was ten thousand eight hundred dollars that is a ten thousand dollar Diamond that is a lab created dime every single ring here is lab created except for yours Mr Wonderful what's your average sale what's the amount our average order value is 3 900 okay so Barbara also has a beautiful lab created engagement ring yours are 3 400. and what did you give Lori 10 000. I'm not here to get in trouble but um well I'm out I'll tell you that buddy so our gross margins are 41 they are and yeah and 41 for an e-commerce jewelry company is definitely above average I think you're a very impressive business person and you're a person that from your heart is pursuing this but this is not my world okay congratulations thank you I'm a huge I'm a huge fan but can I tell you all how much can I get back to this for a second phrase I invested 18 000 in 2013 right that's every single dollar I had when I quit my job we have not raised a single dollar more so cumulatively we've done 26 million dollars 26 million plus in sales I always thought I would have to of course invest more money back in I'm literally standing here we've only invested 18 000 this is the first it's a fantastic I've ever pitched anyone it's no small feat to be able to go from eighteen thousand dollars to 11 million sales and nine percent margins you deserve a lot of credit thank you for that thank you you have a better Mission than 99.9 of them sure you've probably got better marketing than 99.9 of them but that's hard to sustain because anybody else can walk in the door and try to do the same thing there's no barriers to entry to compete with you and that makes it hard to invest in so for those reasons okay thank you I I don't think just anyone can add this to what they were doing they can I think it's amazing what you've built thank you with nothing but great salesmanship and marketing but when my first husband proposed to me I took a new pair of skis instead and it was a good decision when I proposed to my second husband I took a Volkswagen instead so I really wanted a Volkswagen bug so I've never had an engagement ring I've never had a marriage ring and I've never even ever bought anything real in the jewelry area so I'm certainly not your gal here right I really wish you the best of luck but I'm out listen let me let me give it to you straight I appreciate your enthusiasm and I believe you are a good entrepreneur okay thank you your valuation is insane here's my offer I'll take the six percent basically as a tip but I'm going to put a royalty on this deal a hundred bucks a transaction that royalty goes away after I get three times on it okay I'll give you the six hundred thousand I make three times that on a royalty of a hundred dollars a transaction and I put you into my network of La Moore and we try and sell more of this I actually Hey listen I think that deal makes a lot of suffer from him because he is in that business I think Kevin has given you an offer far better than I would so for those reasons thank you thank you Lori what do you want to do you only have one offer I'm trying to convince others to come back in I Have A Bird in Hand you have Kevin here and he is okay at the end of the day we came to make a deal but I don't think that we need help with the things that you're indicating we need help with more distribution we need help with the marketing part of changing what do you think I can do with all my companies what do you think I do I reduce their customer acquisition costs that's what shark Tank's all about that's why you have to pay more for a shark any shark but one that's in the wedding industry you have to pay even more for I know the space inside out I'm not cheap take the offer or not your decision would you do the six hundred thousand for 10 of the company no we're a revenue we're going to talk anymore never never I'll do it for 15 percent of course I've done so many deals in my life evaluation it's a discipline I have so you have a second offered for 15 In the Heat of the Moment you want to do it I'll help you with everything you said marketing wise that can help you with that don't do it 12 percent I promise you I will make Daniel I know all of you all work hard I know that you all work so hard for your money I promise you so hard to literally help solve the water you're gonna say no for three percent I miss you I promise you we're gonna keep growing I will change the world with you together in like I'm out yes I appreciate it now you can deal with things thank you thank you make it easy oh fifteen percent I'll donate the other three percent to your car I'll do 700 000. you hear what I said yeah 15 but that three percent equivalent that we're dividing I will donate it to the cause that we agree with that's really nice do we have a deal [Music] and you oh yes let's do it I am so excited you are such okay ", "ootBox": "[Applause] next in the tank is a little space when you need it the [Music] most hey sharks I'm Robbie and I'm Allison and we're neighbors from Columbus Ohio here seeking $300,000 for 5% of our company when you think back to the past year what is the one

simple for our customers an oop box rolls off the back of a truck plugs into any outlet and it is ready to go sharks oop box is the future demand has been increasing ever since our recent launch and now we need your help to keep up with that demand so who here is an outof the-box thinker and wants to step inside this box and join us on our journey so you are taking old shipping containers recycling them cleaning them up and putting on doors we actually we cut them in half they're they're 20ft Duo cons and we infill the size to make these beautiful spaces that we can put anywhere Rob and Allison I don't understand the need for this product can you please tell me oh I can I can come up with a thousand reasons for it but the question is how much so let me tell you about our business model first that's always a scary response to a simple question well so we lease them and we sell them okay but when you sell them they start at 20,500 I can't I agree with you now Daniel what does the market think how many of you sold our Revenue to this point is $950,000 this year good and how long have you been in business since June 2020 are there zoning ordinances in place that would forbid you in certain towns for dropping them off in a backyard they can go anywhere technically we're considered a tool shed this is for a temporary use this is for somebody who is spending his or her time working on the toilet to get away from their kids which again is not going away right exactly that's not going away okay and how much money have you raised to dat so we've raised $870,000 and how much of the company did you give away 30% and what are your margins on this when we sell it it's about 40% we we each box cost us $122,000 to build most people are leasing them for between $800 and $11,000 a MTH do many of the people who lease from you do it shortterm and convert to a customer who buys the average leas lease term right now is about 8 months and about 60% of our clients have renewed their lease gotten an additional box or requested to purchase the box that they have to me it seems like a clever idea fit with Co perfectly but I don't think that this is the right investment it's just not something that I would be excited about so I'm sorry I'm out thank you you know what I don't get you raise $870,000 why are you trying to raise $300,000 why do you need that money right now our capacity is about five boxes a month that we're doing we need more space we see the potential to grow exponentially and that's what we need this money for but but that's a challenge guys right you're constrained by your capital and your time and the availability of the boxes what I Look to invest in are hockey stick businesses where they kind of feed on themselves and grow themselves and they're not necessarily fully Capital constrained and time constrained it's not the right kind of business for me to invest in so for those Reasons I'm out I feel like a significant portion of the momentum that you have is connected to co it's not clear to me that it's not connected to co and devaluation seems uh to not factor that in so wish you the best but for those reasons am not I mean I get it sales say everything the trouble with this business due to its capital requirements the capital goes in the more successful you are it's impossible to get it back out I hate doing deals where I kiss my money goodbye and then I never see it again I like it where there's a way for me to get it back and I'm not greedy and I'm very creative and I am Mr Wonderful so here is what I'm thinking I give you $300,000 I take the 5% just so I'm a partner in the business but this is a royalty deal for sure and so the way it works every silence Barbara because you don't have any creativity on I'm sure you're right yeah okay so I give you the 300,000 every time you sell a box you give me back $1,000 what happens if they Lee it yeah right it's an advertised payback on the lease I'm getting a portion of the lease it's a way for me to get my Capital back but I want to make back 600,000 before the royalty goes to zero and I think what's going to happen is half your people will buy themselves out at some point well royalty is kind of hard to understand on on this type of product at least for me I'm going to tell you why I think your model is so ingenious it's identical to a business I invested in boho Vans they were renting Camper vans retrofitted Camper vans that look cool I think they had maybe $250,000 in revenue and one year later they had5 million it blew up you're doing the identical thing I'd like to make you an offer of $300,000 for 20% let me defend the 20% W 20% you could say that all right I'll tell you something I'll tell you 5% that's a really big difference difference is one's understandable one's less one's well I can explain mine very simply you got to give me back my Capital times two that's easy iik get a great offer what are you going to do 20% might sound Rich to you but you will never get someone with my skill set to explode your business like I will do I don't sell product I build businesses that's what I'm good at I did it for myself I love words too but 20% is 20% 20% is 20% I'll tell you what I'll do just to have fun just to have fun and to make Barbara's night more interesting forget the whole royalty thing I'll do it for 15% I'll give you 300,000 for 15% right now wow Barbara yes you do 300,000 for 7% no how much 7% I thought I heard 7 % I was insulted I'm more insulted by seven well what about if we did seven plus some loan aspect no but I'll do for 10 if you say yes right now it's not a fa it's not a fair question not a fair question to make us commit to that without talking so we would like of course it is the biggest mistake entrepreneurs make standing on that carpet is having a line in the sand at a certain valuation that is the biggest mistake they always make I'm I'm just saying that we should discuss before answering without discussing but may I say something to you that's a lawyer talking not an entrepreneur so cautious just to have fun I'll do it for 9% oh what a bastard just having fun you you are both Canadians so there's a little bit I'm having fun with it because I actually think there's value here and I love to squeeze Barber's head once in a while you know what there's something about that 10% number that makes you feel like something's worthwhile that all your effort and all your energy and all your intelligence is put into something and it's acknowledged as worthwhile I'll do it for nine no problem it's up to you barara we accept your offer smart people great Kevin we like yours too I'm just happy to have saved you basically 10% appr we very much appreciate your support problem thank you congratulations guys got a goal mon so congrats all the analys very excited you managed it so well okay thank you thank you going into this we are hoping to get a deal with Barbara

who wants to swim to shore and help sunflow make every day a beach day i'd like to buy a dozen how did you come up with the idea that let's make a great beach chair did you have batteries an engineer no but i'm i'm a handbag designer so we started a fashion line of handbags right after we got married we were partners in that business for many years we actually had to learn the process of sketching something right finding the factory finding the materials now would be the time to tell us the phenomenal sales numbers which i'm sure is going to blow all of us away because there is a 16 million pound elephant in the room yeah that's your evaluation we launched 13 and a half months ago we have 2.9 million sales wow we're on track to grow 409 this year talk us through the distribution where did you sell that direct 100 direct to consumer we haven't even touched any that's great congratulations what do you sell them for what's your cost we are selling the product the chair itself is 198. [Music] that retails for 198 198 without the accessories it seems it's 60. 60 of our customers buy every single chair accessory let's break down the numbers 198 for the chair 48 for the sunshade 25 for the drink holder 25 for this margin on this piece of plastic when you sell for 25 bucks that is uh 78 margin wow what does it cost for you to make one share that you're selling 70 to make a chair landed we sell three accessories for every chair we sell so we have sold 11 000 shares but 44 000 units have sold your numbers blow me away amazing leslie what drove you to become entrepreneurs um so my parents immigrated from taiwan 50 years ago they're very proud of the fact that they came here with nothing but a little piece of gold in the bottom of their toothpaste tube so i watched them both work really hard and my father um actually was an entrepreneur he started a business in the basement of our house he started a construction company and he built it to be a multi-million dollar company wow and he was we're so proud of him and he actually passed away a little over a week ago oh no um so to be here it's very special sorry to hear that that's too bad yeah i'm sorry no but he'd be so proud back to our reality here let's talk about these numbers here um i give you a million dollars for six percent i'd have to see 32 million valuation on this company let's say in the next 24 months 36 months to even get a chance to double my money well if you only double your money i'd be really disappointed this is an enormous market the outdoor market just on a beach chair no i have so many products in the pipeline i'm already developing a higher chair that's you know a lot of people requested it and i started developing that three years i was going to see you about a longer chair yes it's gonna we were talking about a lounger and i have an amazing table that's coming we've expanded beyond just chairs we are building a beach brand i love your relationship very good energy your dad's immigrant story resonated a lot with me with your father my dad only went third grade in school because after that he was sent to a concentration camp and he had so much joy with my mom of seeing me go to the first person in our generation to go to college and graduate school and i feel that your dad is here with us and so is my dad and so i like all of that here's my offer i would give you the million dollars i was going to say 25 but i'm going to say 22.5 [Music] thank you i want to go back to something kevin asked how do you make money this will be one of the most successful businesses from shark tank and i'm not saying that because i'm arrogant and i hope you could see where we're humble you seem humble thank you i would go that far but okay go ahead she's pretty humble this is going to be a hundred million dollar plus business okay let's start there because that's a great talking point yeah but the number that matters as it relates to valuation based off of what you've um offered us yes is 16 million dollars in distributable cash when will you have 16 million dollars in distributable cash because six percent of that is one million dollars of course that's how we only not even a return that's just to get our money back when i talk about scaling a company it really has to scale right leslie and greg i gave you an offer do you guys want to accept it or counter we will respond to both we hope that if any or all of you invest that you're along for the ride this isn't a goal to distribute money a year from now i didn't say when i just said it all i'm getting a little bit impatient though i might go hang out with you i don't want to make you wait we're not even close so i don't want to you want to counter uh just because it's not just i'd like to invest in this business but it's so far stretched a million bucks is still a million bucks go ahead and counter great this year we're gonna do close to 4 million next year our goal is to do 10 million and we're estimating a 20 net income so 2 million multiples on this in this industry are 22 times right now so we believe our business will be worth 44 million dollars unrealized hey greg you're answering a lot of questions i ran out of patience i waited for you to give me a counter you could have given me a counter i'd like to want to give me a counter i'd like to out okay hey guys i'll clear i'll clear the deck too it's a great business for you but it's not something i want to invest in i'm out okay i think you're overconfident and i wish i would share that confidence with you but because i don't i don't believe it i'm out you did come in at a very high valuation you did rocket sales fast which is great but also sometimes that can slow so unfortunately i'm out okay we understand all roads lead to all roads lead back to mr wonderful as usual i'm struggling like all the other sharks are in the valuation and just the returns okay and you are in the shark tank so here's my offer i'll do the million bucks okay i'll take a four percent equity position all right less than you're offering me but i want five bucks a share on a royalty until i recoup two million dollars all right then the royalty goes away and i stay your partner is four percent i knew that yeah well i would say ouch on that one no that's not as bad as it sounds i think it's too aggressive though too so uh two million dollars returned to you um after all i wanted everyone was to double my money yeah so can i counter sure yeah so the four percent equity but instead of five dollars per chair up to two million up to 1 million so that you're no longer at risk but then when we've paid you back you're our ongoing partner so you're crazy with no chance of a return other than one day getting an exit with a 4 position that's basically what you're offering me kevin it's actually not a bad offer it's pretty bad because six percent he he has no it's not exactly that's half of his equity not bad at all i'm shocked that he offered it i'm willing to be flexible i'll do your deal if you get me back to the six percent i give you my million dollars i'm your six percent partner but i get nothing back in my cash except the return of it on the royalty at five dollars a share i'll do that deal [Music] five percent and and we pay you back the five dollars per chair to get to a million and we have a deal done there you go kevin good job congratulations guys thank you congratulations a phenomenal presentation thank you so much congratulations guys good luck thank you [Music] i know my dad's watching right now and just knowing that you could take a dream and make it into something you know a reality it's it's a it's something i watched him do and now we're doing it you ", "BootayBag": "burst into the tank is what the entrepreneur hopes is a better and more affordable experience when shopping for intimates hi sharks my name is ellie i'm from san francisco california and i am seeking five hundred thousand dollars in exchange for five percent of my company hello booty bag booty bag is an affordable comfortable and convenient way for women to shop for underwear i started booty bag because i was sick of going to the mall the semi-annual sales the clearance bins the sales clerks i wanted to give women that sexy feeling of sliding on a new pair of underwear without all the hassle or expensive price tag so here's how it works select how many pairs you want to receive in a month your size your style option and for just ten dollars we'll deliver your new favorite undies all without leaving the comfort of your couch our mission is to not only bring a necessity to women at an affordable price but to create a community that represents all women this brand is made for women by women and with every pair purchased we donate to women in need so sharks who's with me and making all women feel good in their undies terrific ellie is it a subscription service yes it is it's a monthly subscription you're not committed to anything so you can get one pair for ten dollars or two for 15. you get all four for 20. and that's every month i burned through four underwear yes i knew you were gonna say that you could skip or cancel at any time but um you can also go in and switch your styles or downgrade or upgrade are these the samples can we like look at this oh guys so this is how i and this is how i get it yeah hello babe i'm here hello babe i'm here yeah so okay and you're manufacturing the underwear yes so my design i stuffed them extra so you guys have bralettes in there as well which i know will look fabulous on you mr wonderful wow this is making you look good mark's blushing over yeah he got a little g-string that's fine i see you flushing a little bit so how did you get started in i mean where did this come out right well my parents are entrepreneurs so although i thought i was not paying attention my entire life i clearly was but i also was like always a hustler always liked money like lemonade stand girl power oh my god hell yeah assistant we have to talk yes when i turned 18 my mom owns a hair salon and i spent all my summers kind of like helping her out and i just felt like this is kind of my path i'm going to take over the salon and i kind of stumbled upon going underwear shopping and waiting for the 5 for 25 and going and digging through the bins and i was like ah this is like such a terrible shopping experience and i was like oh i'm going to just do this it's going to be easy i had a website within two days and borrowed three hundred dollars and three hundred when was 2016. and since then what does sales look like year to date we've done three million three million three million yeah amen sisters amazing that's amazing well you've inspired me i actually saw your panel four years ago and you rocked my world so i have to say like being here is so cool you started with 300 but how much have you raised since then so i've raised none i have no debt wow you've raised no dollars no i'm hoping to raise today how did you pay for the inventory i just went to the store i got clearance underwear and i did the packaging and then i graduated from that and then i was like oh online where can i buy bulk underwear and then i found a manufacturer and i did private label and i graduated all the steps and actually by demand forced me to figure out how to produce my own line best story i've ever heard so far okay but how did you how did people find you at the beginning yeah so we have a huge following on instagram and how did you garner that following it's all actually user generated content on our feed so we have real women posting we don't edit our content so it's as you come just one last number cumulative lifetime sales yeah so 15 million to date i mean 300 dollars to 15 million in sales yeah i was so nervous i'm so excited thank you the one thing that i think is is getting everybody so excited because it's really worth talking about is every other subscription service yeah has to raise a ton of money early on to acquire customers right you should be rolling in the dome so yeah why are you coming here and asking for 500 so our production actually is i use a broker right now in a proper scenario if i did have the direct factory connection i would be able to have shorter lead times i'm working on extremely long lead times because i'm just what are your lead times right now they're about eight months and nine months whoa what eight months so you're designing a product and you don't get it in-house for eight to nine months why why is that so i'm kind of in their mercy um i'm very small and on some of the scales that they do why don't you partner with the manufacturer so that you never have inventory well that's why i'm kind of here it's my first go at all this and so i'm kind of just figuring it out as i go so you really haven't made any money yet i mean we net five percent whoa successful clothiers that have real scale make 15 free tax you're at five so there's ten percent of cost in here and i think i'm going to find it all in the inventory and so you got to get rid of that you got a partner it's worth giving up some of this equity to your manufacturer yes to solve this problem yes you nailed it but in order to make money i need to be big and i have manufacturing problems you're serving almost as a retail store for them right they manufacture then they wholesale it to you and you're kind of at their mercy because you're not going direct to the factory yeah totally and they know me as well so in the four years i've grown up with them they've never been a partner to me how are they treating you i'm just curious they treat you terribly are are they women or men um men yes what a surprise yeah they have never ever been flexible with me um they've made me take product that was actually you know stained or damaged and like i just had they don't you should have just sent it back and said no well they know that every month i have to on the 15th put out products so this is a pain this is a real pain point it is yeah and that's why i'm here you know ellie i love you first of all i am so impressed with you thank you you what you have created with 300 how you have harnessed the power of social media you're creating a movement around your brand yeah which is so unbelievable you know my story i started with 500 out of my extra bedroom the first few years my margins also were not what they are today because i wasn't able to harness great manufacturing deals i didn't have the production i needed but over the last 18 years those things have been able to change right i don't want you to have to wait 18 years and i didn't take an investor for the first 10 years i ran my business i did it on credit card debt lines of credit locs i mean you name it it was hard right and one of the things i wish i would have done earlier is bring in somebody as an investor who had a vested interest that could have helped propel me quicker than taking 18 years and i think i'm the shark that can do that for you so if it's okay i'm gonna offer you the 500 000 but i want 10 i understand subscription we've done that in our company we know how to create community you're a female founder and there's not enough of us out there hell yeah i am one of 20 women in the united states to be a founder of a billion dollar brand so i'm gonna give my money i like to call it kendra cash it's a little unicorn magic in there sprinkled in for that fight okay all right all right i want you to become a unicorn too and i think i can help you get there thank you i love that may i make you an offer as well i could solve the two real problems you have you don't get any money out of this business and that's the problem that's what business is for i have a business that's been in business five years grace and lace they sell like gangbusters i'm only a 20 partner and last month i got a 700 000 check nice they're so cash rich and they're in the exact same business you're in the other problem is you don't know how to manufacture in asia you just don't have that experience because i have that experience at grace and lace i can deliver all that to immediately and so i would like to give you the 500 000 but i really would have to take 20 okay well i appreciate everybody's offer i didn't even say wait a second wait a second hold on a 20 percent is enough for each of us i would also like to make an offer i look at this from just the sheer economics i know where the 10 to 15 is missing it's in the manufacturing i also have logistics in vietnam i've got three companies manufacturing there now so the right price for me is to give you the 500 000 i was gonna say 20 but to get competitive and kind of sit in the middle between these offers i'm willing to throw you you know a very good offer that i wouldn't normally make i know this is crazy thousand for fifty percent just say yes and we'll move forward i'm gonna go out ellie because i think you've got some good choices ellie there's one other thing to consider yeah i have rounder bum men's augmented understood remember that i tell you i'm the only shark in the underwear business right now and i make a lot of men happy well listen i'm so proud of you in everything that you have accomplished but kendra and barbara have made you a great offer so i'm going to go out you have to decide we have one offer here okay kendra and i combine for 20 of your business for 500 000 and then you have this guy whatever he's going to talk why give up 20 that's so greedy the valuation on that is but look what you're getting um would you guys go up to seven hundred thousand for twenty percent wow for seven hundred for twenty percent who's a shark absolutely not yeah no you're not worth 10 million today and when you bring on the right team that is worth more than you could ever put on a check right but you have to feel comfortable with that too yeah you know 20 it just feels a little high and i'm not undervaluing you guys at all i appreciate both of your offers it just it was a little bit higher than i wanted to go with i'm willing to do it at 15. okay i'll go back to my original offer if you're not comfortable with that i'll do 500 or 10 percent excuse me did you just abandon me i abandoned you it sounds wow i abandoned you because i could see in her face that that made her feel sick and made her feel less than and made her worth feel not valued and i can't you're willing to do it for 10 with my original offer i think 10 is is fair based on my experience let's not even think about it anymore it's done done whoa i'm so excited sorry i appreciate you guys everybody apologize terrific partner thank you congratulations thank you guys congratulations thank you so excited sorry barbara i'm sorry i like her more than i like you now i wanted kendra i got kendra we're ready to take over the world one booty at a time baby i would have liked a piece of the bouquet you're not getting any booty no booty for you you ", "GoOats": "[Music] next up is a convenient and delicious way to ensure you don't miss out on the most important meal of the day [Music] hi my name is nohom janeau and i'm seeking 150 000 in exchange for 10 equity in my company go oats sharks we all know breakfast is the most important meal of the day but in your busy morning the last thing you want to be doing is spending time making breakfast and let's be honest a granola bar is not a meal your morning meal should be effortless we all know oatmeal is a hearty way to start the day but who wants to stand here at the stove and whisk this slimy mess who wants to juggle a spoon in a bowl as they drive well breakfast and snacking just got a whole lot simpler let's get rid of this mess whoa sharks today i give you the first ever oatmeal in a ball same ingredients you might put in your oatmeal at home milk butter sugar still cut oats we're doing the work for you but we're making them bite-sized hand-held in our heat and eat format it's so simple to prepare for creamy oatmeal within minutes it's that simple who's ready to try go oats oatmeal in a ball all i need to know how did you start making oat meal balls how did this start at 16 years old i had my first opportunity to work in a restaurant i started off as a busboy then a food runner in the middle of a shift on a saturday night a cook i guess it was too busy a cook walked off the line the owner comes running in she's like hey i need a cook and that was over 16 years ago and i never looked back so basically um after that stint in the restaurant i decided okay this is what i want to do with my life and so i embarked on my culinary journey i got to work at awesome places like four seasons uh philadelphia w hotels um and most recent um hyatt regency in tyson's corner and so i was the head chef they asked me to write a breakfast menu that i'll guess could easily pick up walk around the hotel with without making a mess the response that i got i was like wait a second there's something different about this one and that's so that was in 2015 i'm like you know what i'm going to share this with the rest of the world lover oh this is better than oatmeal it's really really really good crispy on the outside that is creamy i don't eat breakfast i'm not a breakfast eater i would eat this all day and i'm always running late because i have three boys and getting them out the door in the morning is a nightmare so we'll do cereal bars or something if they're you know i'll have breakfast on him serve and they never have time they're getting their backpacks they're throwing their stuff in yes so this is really cute as a package but the whole point is is that you've got a heater oh so so wait for this one okay we're still waiting wait ready for that box can go into the oven and be baked oh the reason well there you go the reason why just like this yes just like that yes how long does you have to bake this how long does it so from frozen it takes about 10 uh 10 to 15 minutes oh and but it says microwave for 30 to 60 seconds yeah but that's what we're doing that's the microwave when you're hungry and you want something you trust and particularly if i could take something like this in the box pop it in the microwave for a minute grab and go and drive and eat because i'm a i'm a driver eater me too it must be a texas thing it must be right it must be and so that's efficiency to me so do you sell them like this or only like this so right now we uh we're selling them in the pouches uh they're uh that's what we created they're being sold currently and hopefully this is just right when 170 calories which is what it says here yes is that three or is that that's for three okay how quickly can you get the boxes out it's already set up okay so let's talk about your sales uh first year we did uh uh thirteen thousand dollars in sales and what was what year was that uh 2017 2018 we did 57 000. okay and 2019. 2019 was about 54-57 it was pretty much flat and how are you selling them march of 2017 i walked into a whole foods at that time whole foods was allowed to bring in local products in their region and so while i still have my full-time job i'm going into um i'm going into production for yourself you're putting them in the package you're delivering them to the stores at least you're hustling to see if there's any proof of concept right exactly i'm proving this selling through yes so you're working a full-time job still i got laid off in march through the covid um all out hotel business left i know for a lot of people that would be like a negative um i was actually i looked at it as a blessing you know um from god and because i get to work on goats full-time so what do you sell this bag for i sell it into uh distribution at 266. that's all yeah what does it cost you to make uh a dollar 35. well that's the problem you're not charging enough they sell it for 4.99 that's that's not enough not enough everything above your cost has to have one dollar added to it because you're not making enough margins to scale this business i'd like to make you an offer [Music] i'll give you the 150 000 as you ask but i will have to have 25 percent ouch okay and the second thing i'm going to help you with the big box stores once you start getting into the big box stores you're going to have slotting fees just getting your phone call met it is a nightmare very few people are able to navigate that and do it well so for that 25 you will have my help on that and i know that landscape like the back of my hand so 150 000 for 25 what do you say do i have the option to kind of like hear out if there's anything else um i i i appreciate your offer no i don't want to be i really don't care for it to be shopped around but you can certainly give me a counter if you wish so i was i am this is a moment of focus because the risk you have is if you don't nail this deal you don't know if there's more to come burn there if there isn't you're giving her tremendous leverage so you really need help buddy i mean you really do why don't you be quiet i do i do need the help but and i love barbara for that amount of equity like i was hoping that maybe i can like if like who's your best friend on the panel you know who do you get along with the most like could you pull them out well let me tell you who i don't like i don't like mr wonderful okay at all okay but i love mark cause he's a billionaire now what does that have to do with it my hope is that like i can i was hoping we could have a conversation if we're gonna go that high in equity like maybe you could bring one of your friend like let me tell you what's wrong with having two sharks on a deal you wind up immediately forming a committee i have to check let's say i bring mark in i check with mark mark says hey we'll see what barbara thinks it goes back and forth i try to call laurie it takes me two weeks to get a return pull and that's the truth okay okay but then i call her husband and he calls me back because he's always wanted to date me amazing so you're better off with one shark in the same way you're better with one wife you could hyper focus on her and make her happy i can make you happy okay do you have a counteroffer uh would you uh be willing to do 150 grand for uh for 15 no it's just too low what do you say we compromise at 20. big moment for you here you get this shot once okay bingo got a deal you made the right choice you made a great choice great product i know we can't hug but such a good product great job [Music] barbara believes not only in me but she also believes in the product and that's who i want on my team and the joke's gonna be on all the other sharks you ", "Pooch Paper": "hello sharks my name is tracy rosenstiel and i'm from barbara new york city yeah i'm here seeking a 250 000 investment in exchange for 12 equity in my company so let's get down to business we all know that dogs well dogs poop and they poop there's an estimated 22 billion pounds of doggy duty dropped each year in this country alone you know what that makes me think sharks that is a heaping huge mound of stinky opportunity so what happens to all that waste there are millions of pet parents who can attest to using single-use plastic bags that are discarded and end up in landfills each and every day one common denominator of every product that's on the market that's eco-friendly is plastic sharks allow me to introduce you to pooch paper a paper alternative to plastic dog waist bags pooch paper is already recycled non-chlorine bleach paper that's 100 compostable 100 biodegradable made right here in the usa and manufactured using renewable energy so in three very simple steps simply take a piece of pooch paper grab your doggy's beauty no matter how big or small twist the play-doh size of the paper which by the way on both sides is grease resistant and then toss in the trash so sharks nature is calling and pooch paper is picking up who's going to help me save this planet one cup at a time well all right so i i i could you know sustainability re well not reusability in this case you wouldn't want to reuse it but the ability to to have something that's you know grease proof because you know you could get the pla the paper bags uh but the paper bags don't work that well either uh and you know because it comes it kind of comes right through especially the more the longer it sits in there um so i you know i think uh i think there's something here i hope she has some sales to back up this uh this percent or the this valuation that she's she's throwing out there um you know i but the i do kind of question like would it be better if we were to instead of having a separate product to buy just for that uh i mean people buy plastic bags just for that purpose but you know reusab like can we coat the current paper bags that were that a lot of states are starting to switch over to or mandatorily switching over to can we coat that in that stuff and then bam all of a sudden we have a you know a dual at least a two-purpose paper product uh that i mean it can't be recycled at that point but um maybe we need to come up with a better recycling process or something but you know what we don't need is uh or what we what we do need more of is more comments like duckies down here yo joe good question about the amount of times a knife needs sharpening absolutely uh i try my best to to come up with questions i know sometimes uh some of my my super entrepreneur community comes up with some great questions as well down in the comments if so if you have a great question go down below drop it in the comments i'd love to hear from you and while you're down there smash that like button for the youtube algorithm so we can get this video into the hands of more super entrepreneurs like yourself big issue here about this okay i'm gonna tell you a quick story and then you have to answer this question okay when i first moved to boston it was the first week i was there i was up at four i had my lights on in the kitchen and a man with a great dane was watching february and the man who was walking the dog he looked around and our eyes met and i knew at that moment he was very unhappy because i saw him and that piece of paper would not even pick up half of that steaming talent wow all right okay so the easy question the easy answer there is is he just offers bigger sizes but i i think the the other thing is is like if you're out walking your dog then it becomes a thing of like okay so you twist it and then i don't feel like i would want to leave it in a like i'm still going to end up wanting a bag to put it in and i don't know that i want to just leave it open in a different way i mean maybe like a twist tie or something could could uh you know solve that problem i also wonder if the um if the stain resistantness of the paper is a product of uh what pets uh i think is called the uh teflon like is it like a form of teflon because that's not great for the environment either so i i got yeah i got some more some more questions there so these are 12 by 12. uh later this year we'll be releasing a skew that's 15 by 15 or i can't be carrying this so what i like about my poop bags right now is that they're in a very convenient little holder so when they do decide to go i could just grab it out right right how do i hold these so i've partnered with somebody who um has a product and i just resell it and it's a three by three canvas pouch zip pouch and then it has a um a snap that you can put on your leash you can put on your belt buckets or your stroller i do sell those yeah okay tell us about you what's your background so like kevin i've spent 20 years on wall street i work actually in trading floor technology on the board of trade i get it wall street same thing i'm interested tracy you know concerns flow away when you have sales numbers are there any yes there are so we have been on the market for about seven months sales since inception are just shy of fifty thousand fifty thousand so tracy what is a one box cost and what does it cost you to make so it costs me 3.66 landed i wholesale it for 6.99 it retails at 12.99 that's a 45 margin okay so because you're from wall street this is going to be very easy to do 250 000 for 12 i'm just the leap of faith to give you a 2 million valuation when you've only got 50 000 sales do you see any problem with that wall street tracy i don't i think that we're set to reach at least 400 by the end of this year we are now in 82 stores nationwide and we're selling online and then we're about one week away from launching in 1061 stores for target nationwide wow first off ding ding for being able to pull that off that is not an easy task and uh i mean obviously she worked in wall street so money money flow maybe she had some some uh investors which i guess we'll find out uh if she already has if she owns 100 of the company but um you know having that opportunity to be able to supply that many of uh the of that product over any product really um to that many stores is is quite an accomplishment so ding ding for that i mean it's a great business for you but it's not something i get excited about congratulations but for those reasons i'm out i think your price point is high compared to the competition the common competition which is plastic and i think that's an obstacle for those races about so i don't okay before anybody else gets the the bright idea to go out uh i i i don't i mean it is it is high 12.99 is quite high um especially when you're competing when your competition is literally the plastic bag that they give away for free now that is slowly going away but when the competition is free uh or at least a portion of that competition is free it it it definitely makes it a hard sell at 13 uh to to for a 12 by 12 sheet of paper i mean you're getting i think it said like 48 of them or 50 of them so it's it's it's not bad but you really gotta hammer home that that target audience and i talk about this all of the time fact i just did a video uh maybe i'll i'll drop a link down in the comments or the comments below about finding that target market so you can get more customers and uh in that video i talk about four key questions to answer in order to be able to really hone in on who that target market is and and get into the psyche of of who they are what they do why they do it and and uh how you could better reach them but i i think yeah i think tracy you know 250 000 is a bit pricey we'll see if kendra maybe is a little more interested uh but i i can't imagine kevin's going to be that interested i think your mission is fantastic i think that to bring an apartment doesn't seem necessary you really know your stuff you're doing all the right things i don't think that you need to give away equity i'm not going to give you an offer because i just don't think you need it i'm out okay wall street tracy i'll make you an offer in two ways okay 250 000 for 50 so we're partners okay wow i'll do it for a one dollar royalty in perpetuity with no equity [Music] okay so i like the in perpetuity idea with no equity position very much yeah one dollar is a bit steep yeah i'll tell you why you see our interest will be 100 aligned if i'm getting royalty even though i don't own any other business because i'll do everything in my power to increase sales just to show that you know what my thinking is because i have other deals with royalties wicked good cupcakes just paid me their millionth dollar royalty i owe no equity our interests are totally aligned it's the biggest worth of deal in shark tank history and if you ask her she's very happy so those are my offers i've given you two structures pick one so so before she picks one i let me so my thought is yeah don't give up 50 but 50 isn't isn't the end of the world again i don't know if she owns 100 of the company tracy if you would love to come on the show here and get you know have an interview with me i'd absolutely love to have you here um so just drop a comment down below and uh we'll get you get you here on the show but uh you know we're talking about paper here you know uh there's some branding involved and obviously she's done some leg work to be able to get into that many targets so i i think that she's definitely worth more than uh 500 000 even though she's only at 50 000 in sales at the moment and i'm dropping my pen but i think the royalty deal like you know if i was in that position i would try to counter back um you know i'll give you the dollar the dollar is not a big deal up until you maybe three times your money then let's drop it down to a quarter or 50 cents for kevin he probably would want at least 75 cents but uh but i would try to try to push it down to about 50 cents 50 60 maybe 75 cents tops um and that would give you an opportunity i think because i think the other problem is is uh if she doesn't have a patent which i don't think she mentioned she's gonna end up coming against competition like uh you know paper with some teflon if it's if it's teflon material or some type of anti you know leakage um chemical on the paper i i i just think that she's gonna come up against it and and uh and end up ultimately having to drop the price down now if kevin could help her get the cost down from 366 landed maybe 266 landed a dollar fifty all of a sudden like it's a total game changer right uh and and he would be worth his weight in gold and that dollar you know if you got it down to a dollar fifty okay you're at 250 you're still a dollar uh a dollar uh six dollar 16 cheaper uh at that point if you got your cost of 1.50 so yeah i i i think the royalty deal is definitely the way she needs to go and we'll see if kendra wants to jump in here before she goes and uh takes a deal yeah honestly i think it's universal i'm saying it's a good offer can you believe it i never say that about you very rarely i mean you've solved a big problem and you are helping the earth so thank you for that and people love their pets and they will spend crazy money on their pets and so i think you're on to something but i do think that mr wonderful's offer is fantastic i think he'd be a great partner for you he's a better shark for this so i'm so i'm out wow wow i'm really really surprised by that uh i'm sure i'm sure tracy wanted to get on board the the kendra train uh or lori train but you know kevin does a great job uh with his royalty deals he he does a great job well in general uh and you should totally go check out his his youtube channel if you haven't uh that's it's floating around in the youtubes but yeah i i uh yeah take the world deal try squeezing down to 50 or 75 cents ask him if he can get can he get the price can he get my call you know her costume tracy i'd like to counter go ahead i do very much like your uh in perpetuity deal no equity but it's going to put a damper a little bit also on my short-term cash flow tracy understands cash flow no no i'll tell you why because i will be doing two things i think i gotta figure out a way to lower your costs absolute ding ding you gotta pick up one i'll do either deal and stick stay tuned because we're gonna check out uh tracy's website here in a minute depe you know regardless if she takes the deal or not all right so it's non-negotiable no push it push it down push it down then accept [Music] kevin would say this is a home run for you i think it's good for kevin to come in right now is such a critical moment that i still am in a position of protecting 100 of my equity and kevin's also on the hook with me in perpetuity yes and uh that that is awesome so let's check out uh their her website here uh as seen on shark tank i always love seeing that save our planet one pup at a time you could shop right there uh they got 12 by 12. there's the the pooch pouch uh that's on sale for 16.99 wow that is that is a pricey uh proposition there for a little thing but i mean you only got to buy one and it and it you know it makes life easier for you oh there you go that's see now that's what i want to see uh they have a reusable clip i hope i assume it's a reusable clip uh while on the walk with your best friend yep that is uh that is what i yeah that's great 12.99 maybe a little pricey i'd like to see some reviews on it i don't see any reviews on it let's go back to the home page uh generally everyone that watches this channel knows i like to see faces well here's a dog face which is very important and there's there's tracy and her pup and you got some other dogs uh so let's let's go pop over to instagram where they got almost 3 000 followers uh doing doing well there seems like they got some engagement going on some likes let's see when's the last time they posted uh two weeks ago uh pooch paper on shark tank airing this friday so they they were just uh back on the chant or back on shark tank i should say and yeah i mean they're doing doing pretty good let's see facebook 354 likes so not not a ton there uh it's been a couple of weeks since they posted there i'm definitely not getting as much engagement as instagram which again it's not surprising you watch any of these these uh videos you you'll see that that's you know generally the case is that instagram is it's just where it is with these with these types uh almost any type of product um they sell them on chewy apparently they're temporarily out of stock that is that i mean that's a good thing but that's not a good thing you know to not have to have your uh pooch paper available i what i'm curious actually going back to the website i wonder do they have oh they have a pooch paper dispenser how much do they charge for that 165 all right that's uh that's cool you can get dispenser refills for that but i but i don't see did they come out with the uh it's 14 by 14 inch okay so they do have the bigger one and they lowered the price oh no it is 12.99 still 13. it's only uh 50 cents more for the 14 by 14 inch which is good which tells me that uh kevin must have gotten their their cost down for them uh or that you know or maybe tracy got the cost down for them uh which is which is a great sign so yeah uh definitely happy to see that i see the original poop eggs come uh compostable bag uh com compost compostable i'm not sure how to say that word uh let's see it's unscented so this is this is what their competition is got and they only but only has one review 200 200 bags for 15 bucks seems like a pretty solid deal there today oh they did have eight reviews here on on uh on chewy eight and a half uh eight or eight stars 4.2 stars total question cold weather makes this paper more brittle which makes it difficult to use huh interesting something i did not think about and it looks like on amazon they do have it in stock or will be in stock soon and selling as cheap as ten dollars uh right with save 23 off so let's just check out usually i like check out the one star review see what they got going on there so uh let's see need some work the papers don't close well enough uh to be carried a distance to a trash can don't uh don't waste your money tears easily and not big enough might might as well so i i wish they would these people that wrote these reviews um included uh what what size dog do you have like that's a huge like thing there uh might as well use paper towels uh i kind of doubt that that would be the case but but i you know as i normally would say i'd like to see people adding uh to the conversation so the you know having the business owners having somebody at the business representing the business reply to these and try to reach out see if they can change the minds not necessarily the people that wrote the reviews but change the minds of people who are reading the reviews so you get maybe a little less people finding it helpful maybe they'll find your reply more helpful that you are responsive uh to them it's a great idea but the price outrage is 50 sheets for 13 i have two small dollars that ends up using at least two to three per walk times three blocks a day wow their dog's pooping three times a day i i did not know that i you know we have a dog and well she goes mostly out in the backyard and it gets cleaned up so i and then uh i don't really think i never really thought about how many times a day that is happening i love the idea of the environmentally conscious but it's shameful when people try to cash in on such a greedy way like this yeah well i mean like it's it's a thing um i i think it's great i i think it's a great idea uh especially if you're doing the walk thing uh it's better than having a whole bunch of plastic bags crammed in like one of those little container things but you know this is a great idea going down below leaving a comment like ducky and smashing that like button for the youtube algorithm so we can get this video in the hands of more super entrepreneurs like yourself make sure you go check out shopsuperjoe.com so you get uh one of these high quality t-shirts or one of these high quality super

a company that combines two loves into one product [Music] hi sharks my name is Chase Terrell and I'm from Sand Springs Oklahoma my name is Chris DeDe and I live in Austin Texas this is my son and my brother-in-law and I'm Jake Rutledge the inventor of the chilling reel today we're fishing for three hundred thousand dollars for a 10 stake in our company wow my dad has solved one of the world's biggest problems can't hold my beer at the same time that's why I invented the chilling reel the only drink insulator you can fish with and the only drink insulator with a hand line reel on the side if you enjoy fishing and you know how much of a hassle it is to pack all your gear just to casually pitch out a line was not made to reel in a Marlin however what it was made for is nothing short of a real good time we have the chilling reel design to be easily castable reelable and of course drinkable just pitch it out grab your slack and tip it back and start reeling them in cold we've caught bass crappie and catfish on the chilling reel but today we're fishing for sharks who's gonna take a bite all right nice nice where's the rod like how is the ride with the fish you're catching this is good enough so this just is basically for smaller fish you're not taking it that serious right so how much pound test line is on here eight pound test is on there but eight pounds actually I have thrown 50 pound braid on there yeah and I've caught 15 16 pound blue cat I caught a three and a half foot hammerhead shark really yes if you hold the line and try to reel it it'll cut your hand but if you if you sit here and use the this there you go that's your crank is that in Florida yes tell us what's happening there well I'm reeling a fish in right now where's the fish he's coming back I don't have my phone I hope you get I hope you send it back right oh yeah yeah let's be clear though this is not it's not made for the big guys it's for those days and you just want to chill and reel it's fascinating I got to know what happened to you guys to invent this okay here's the store my family we're on a family vacation down in Florida and we're all out in the water drinking a beer and I look down and there's fish everywhere well I gotta catch those fish and my buddies looked at me and they said man you bring a rod out here you are going to upset everybody out here I said hey watch this I didn't even have to say hold my beer I just went in tied some line onto the bottom of my Koozie wrapped it around would come out pull all the string out throw it out catch a fish reel it in I just kept spilling my beer everywhere did you catch anything oh yeah we were always catching fish Jake what's your background I've been a Tulsa firefighter for 21 years good for you thank you so I have always wanted to come up with something and never did you ever dream you'd be fishing and drinking and ending up on shark day that's it why don't we start with last year's sales and now what you're going to do this year uh well I'll tell you the last 12 months we've done 1.34 million in sales guys on this crap and this little thing chill Anglers out there was not expecting that answer 1.3 million in a year that's right in 12 months so last year up until June there had been 50 000 in sales and then from then on we finished the year at 680 000. what about this year this year we're at about 760 so far this year about 1.65 damn so guys this thing is a total little piece of crap selling that's what I thought I thought the exact same thing until I saw this that there was this response that happened from people who just want to be out hang out on the water float the river what does it cost to make and what do you sell one for they sell for 12.95 for the solid colors 15 for the camos uh they cost us two dollars and six cents and we manufacture in Tulsa up in Oklahoma did you throw a lot of money at marketing we did okay yes how much have you spent in the last 12 months it's about 40 percent so four hundred thousand yes little over so wow so take out the advertising cost what's your net margin last year we made a little over 70 000 to how much have you made this year this year we are negative 25 000. we just placed an order for uh fifty four thousand that's where your cash went right we've got 350 000 worth of inventory to our warehouse right now look the thing is so ridiculous but I can't help but respect the sales 1.65 million bucks I mean it's just that's that's just but it's such a piece of crap I mean look I wish you the best but I can't invest in this I'm out oh well we hope you'll reconsider this is fun for you guys it's not investable for me it's not really a company for me you know but I wish you good luck I love what you've done I'm out thank you Laurie one thing I'd like to add though just uh so you're all aware we all think there's some opportunities to license the technology as well which happens to be patented reeling in on a on a koozie the drink insulator that you can fish with I wanted to be the patent officer that saw that one what what are you gonna do it's a great fun business we're selling Good Times a good time but as an investor I'm not going to have as much fun right I didn't come up with it I'm not with you guys every day running it I I just don't think it's for me so I'm out sorry to hear that Mark look guys I've got two fundamental problems one there's just not enough net margin to it right you're spending 40 on your advertising and so that's really where you've got to kind of make it better but even if you did a lot better there's not enough margin left there for an investor so that's the first part but the bigger problem is as somebody who lives in Texas if you can't hold your beer no matter what you're doing it wrong so I'm out look uh I've been really thinking because first I was completely out then I was completely in and one of you said it you're selling fun and people want fun yeah we just had a year of covet we were all locked up at home people want excitement and fun and you're really selling them for a very small price point you're selling them fun um my my issue is you know there isn't enough room in this deal like you guys are in a boat and the boat is staying afloat but if I come in It's Gonna sink or we're going to get a lot bigger of a boat we're going to need a bigger boat where I think we can really optimize on that margin with the marketing advertising is we've seen this year as a branding year that's what's been expensive I think especially this first year battle crunch in as we get awareness Chris I've made crazier Investments and and done really well I just don't know I mean I I love the fun I love the beer this feels all about royalties oh what are you gonna do Robert I will give you the 300 000. I'll keep 10 as equity and I'll take two dollars per real I like it my first royalty deal this is exciting learn grasshopper learn what do you think you have the margin to do it how long is the royalty in place Robert as long as we're having a good time David oh man so that's the difference between Robert and Kevin he said it very nicely but that means perpetuity cut the throat man you guys can counter uh I I I don't think we're in for royalties if you wanted to go 15 percent for three hundred thousand we could do that you don't like the royalty but you don't mind the equity right right I mean the the money money's great but we're here for for a partner all right three hundred thousand thirty five percent not a hard negotiation I'm taking a flyer on you guys I think you've really figured out something it may go somewhere I'm willing to risk the 300 000 and I've worked really hard for 300 you know people always sit up here and they think oh it's just money to you guys I remember the days where I worked my ass off for you know 10 bucks so it's a lot of money I believe in you guys that's my offer 300 000 35 percent you want to take it I'm happy to go along for the boat ride if not we'll have a beer together would you go to 20 percent no no okay I appreciate the offer but we're gonna have to decline way to stick to your guns guys that's right good job cheers thank you all those guys one two three [Music] I did what we're saying but drink no idea thank you guys keep having fun and making money appreciate it thank you good luck guys what were they thinking oh look at that that's surprising if everybody thought it was fun everybody in the US is gonna think it was fun we didn't catch a shark today but hey there's lots of sharks out there we'll go out and catch one tomorrow ", "Drifties": "next up is a product to make water sports more [Music] comfortable hey sharks my name is Wes and I'm Greg we paddled up the coast of California to see if you want to take a bite out of our company drift line we're here today seeking $100,000 for 10% equity in our company drif line is a revolutionary water sports apparel brand based out of San Diego we're here to solve a big problem see a couple of years ago during a dawn patrol surf session it was that transitional time of year where the water was just too warm for a full wet suit and too cold for your traditional board shorts a net liner the people even still wear these things they're insanely uncomfortable and don't provide any warmth or protection there has to be a better way and that's why we created drify drify are the premier 2inone board short with a patent pending wet suit liner connect to a stylish outer shell offering Comfort warmth and chave protection specifically designed for water sports and we've all seen that guy at the beach doing the classic waddle toward the excruciating pain of chafing but with drifty's cloud-like wet suit liner we solve that problem while keeping you warm and supported drify have been tested by almost every waterport athlete out there they've also been tested in the most extreme conditions all over the globe and remember you never want to swim of sharks without your drifty good job guys so each of you has a pair of drify in front of you it feels like a neoprene is it a neoprene that's what it is neoprene is a rubber foam that basically stores heat and prevents that initial cold shock that you see guys get when they first step in the water so basically it's a wet suit married to board shorts correct we combined the two hadn't really been done before actually yeah we actually have applied for our Utility Patent on it and hopefully to get next coule it seems really smart to me I mean I will tell you it's really great quality tell us about your sales currently year to date we're actually at about $125,000 in sales last year we did about 100,000 in sales and we're projected on Pace to do about 200 this year how are you selling these direct to Consumer do you put them in specialty stores so right now we're actually 99% direct consumer are you spending a lot of money to get people to your site actually not really um this past year we we only really spent about $10,000 in marketing what does it cost sorry you never told us so those retail for $89 it cost $25 to make 33 landed I'm surprised I mean that's not bad at all this is complicated yeah well that's why we went through so many different manufacturers and iterations to get the real material and product we need and is your history in manufacturing no actually I had a sales marketing background I actually was taking night classes for graphic design which is my full-time now and that's kind of what spawned the idea when we had that legitimate light bulb moment on the beach I needed a project for school and I was like well let's just you know see if I can brand this that's great and by the end we we actually had a business and you did it what's your background um so I'm actually a financial background and now I'm more in Tech and Marketing sales it is a fantastic idea what I'm struggling with is can you sell enough just shorts to make a sustainable business that's part of where we have this patent that we're uh hopefully going to get in the next couple months here but really what we're building is not just for surfing we're also expanding into water sports that need specific iterations on the actual product specifically for that sport give me an example of that for instance kaying is different from surfing and you can add additional lengths to the neoprene and things like that so you can iterate Under the Umbrella of the patent specifically for different water sports how much money will you guys make this year we're pretty much break even at this point cuz we're putting everything back into R&D and honestly right now we have that funnel of people that want to buy our product we just need to place bigger purchase orders to drive down the cost and increase the margins do you have the order or do you think you'll get orders if you drive down the cost so we've already sold out of SKS and styles for this upcoming season and the problem is now people want them so you cannot keep up with the orders at the moment no it's very good Innovation you know I look at million valuation I I don't think that's that crazy but I just don't know how big this Market is that's the only reason I'm out I just don't feel the the scaling of it this is not for me I'm out this is a really phenomenal job you've done in the creativity um putting the two things together but you know I like to hit like a broad Mass audience love it love you but because it's niche I'm out I'm not sure about the expansion like you were saying how easy that's going to be but I do believe that if you're in that world you buy a pair you're never going to go back to a regular right board short again right but there's two other sharks here that are in the space Mary's had Rockstar numbers with the paddle board company and Robert you have hamboards S CL also San Diego you need a collaboration with somebody who can bring you other people's members and other people's marketing collectively you don't compete you compliment each other so I don't think I can add any value here I'm out appreciate guys congrats on what you've accomplished it's super smart my problem is I don't know if it can be big enough you know you can be a two $3 million company but it it's really not a fit for me so for those reasons amounts yeah you know I'm definitely in this space but it's got to be enough yeah that it's worth my time we know this space well we can really help you with all that like I just can't do it for 10% what can you do it for Robert I'll actually give you a little more money there's a term I love which is accelerate to fail meaning I think you got to go faster to find that breaking point in the business yeah let's not do this for 10 years let's accelerate I sense an offer coming that's going to be very painful I'll give you 150,000 but I want 1/3 ouch I'm I'm chafing I'm chafing uh I mean I we very much appreciate that would you bump that down to 15% no okay no um there is only one shark that's in because I think I understand the complexity and how hard this is if you get the patent if we get the patent we're going to need more than 150 000 it's it's a whole another scale like at this point though little more money let's go faster um well Greg and I I'm you know Wes I can't read lips so you don't have to cover your mouth it's fair that's fair um I mean we we definitely you know love the the work that you've done the space I mean would you do something down to 20% I mean could we get you to that number no no I I just I know how much work it is I mean the I think the the highest we could probably goes 25% Robert that's reasonable it is reasonable I'm offering you more money let's not forget that and you know honestly if I'm worth 25 I'm worth 33 and that that's what I felt comfortable with that's my gut feel I'll give you $1,000 for 20% wow well you got to take it right now say yes I think the highest we can go for that is 15% yeah guys I mean think about what's on the table right now I offered you 100,000 for 20% you only had 5% flexibility and you said you needed us I mean I guess you're indecisive so I'm out again what are you going to do Robert I think if you're comfortable at 25 you're comfortable at 28 I'll come down from 33 to 28 what a head squeezer uh I mean we we came here uh kind of with numbers in mind so unfortunately we're going to have to pass out that number you got to do what you got to do thank you though thank you so much thank you so much sharks good luck guys stick your guns we just weren't willing to give up a third of what we've worked so hard at but at the end of the day we didn't feel like his heart was in it and that's what we're in it for so you know for that reason we were out ", "Springer": "next in the tank is a functional accessory for your furry [Music] Pals hi sharks I'm Shannon from Austin Texas and this is my dog reishi and I'm Griffin from Oxnard

Springer was born so what am I investing in Springer so we created a new pet brand Springer that sells this bottle so this is your first product right do you have any patents yes we have eight patents covering these products eight eight wow utility design in the US and uh internationally so when did you start going to Market and how were you selling it our first year of sales was in in 2016 and we did about $711,000 in Revenue first year Wow Wow for the next couple years we sold between about $650 and $750,000 per year and in 2020 we got $1.7 million in sales wow and how much money did you make cuz you cuz there's got to be great margins yeah there are great margins yeah we made $100,000 and that's not great that's it 100,000 yeah so last year we we decided it was going to be a growth year for us so we reinvested a lot of our profit into more IP branding building out new innovations that are coming later this year so tell us your margins what's the cost to make one of these is about $3 on average to make one of these products our margins on on retail 88% are mini the mini sells for um 22 the medium size sells for 25 and The Growler sells for 28 those are great margin but where' the money go the 6.4 million valuation is a bit of a stretch for a single Product Company but actually you're just breaking even you're making 100,000 on 1.7 I'm calling that breaking even I'm looking for $500,000 worth of of costs that I don't understand where they are something is eating up $500,000 you got 88% gross margins yeah something else doesn't add up we had a lot of investment in IP and brand protection because what was the total expense of that for Branding it was about 150,000 but you see how all this doesn't add up cuz those expenses are aced over 5 years you know well a lot of a lot of it was in went invested in the last year and those are onetime expensives and then we have a team so it's us our parents we have uh two other employees in house what do you guys make we make about 70,000 look I think the products are really cool right they're ingenious in a lot of specs but what concerns me is that you've been selling it for 5 years I'm surprised it hasn't done a lot more for those Reasons I'm out who is the person that came up with a brilliant idea of only offering us 6% so to justify that we're on track this year to sell $2 million and uh next year we're projected to three uh $3.2 million we can give you the money is that all you want we want your expertise we got to work too for the money we need to Blitz for 6% really you want me to pay and get a small return and then work for you doesn't make any sense primarily it's not worth my time I'm out okay thank you thank you I think it's a very good product but I can't get past one thing and it might be my own bias and it might be my age but the thing I was taught is when you start a business the first thing that gets paid is the business and the last thing that gets paid is the owner yes and that's why and you're doing it the opposite you're paying yourself 70,000 a year I mean you're starving the business for cash to make a living I don't want to be part of that I'm out okay so let me take a stab at this all right what I like about this deal is sales I love cash flow yes this is a family business the only way I would do this deal is I want to stay out of that soup all right with a 6 % ownership I have no say anyways this is a royalty deal it keeps everything aligned my interest to sell more is very high so I'll give you the $400,000 I want 3% Equity of schmuck Insurance in case the product gets sold while I'm in my royalty agreement with you and I want $3 a unit until I get my $400,000 back and then I want half of that a $150 in perpetuity I have lots of people can blow this up digitally and I would do that cuz my interest are aligned that's my offer okay okay thank you really apprciate your thank you I love this I think it is so smart and so Innovative and just like why would you use anything else I'm going to make you an offer I'm going to give you the 400k for 10% but I want preferred stock which means I would get distributions first whenever there's profits that are paid out awesome thank you for your offer would would you do it for 8% no I got to stick at 10 you guys come on it's risky and I got to I got to be excited to get out of bed Lori we'd be happy to do that deal with you got deal fluffy and better family w we're so excited good I'm so happy to be part of the family bye you see guys congratulations well done thank you now that we have Lori on our team we're ready to Blitz the market she was the ideal shark for us we feel like she's already part of our Springer family wait you're not subscribed to the Shark Tank Youtube channel well then for that reason I'm out for ", "Stryx": "first in the tank is a Cosmetic Company for an underserved Market [Music] hey sharks I'm John and I'm the viewer we're from New York and we're seeking six hundred thousand dollars in exchange for five percent of our company do you know what everybody in this room has in common right now besides being on television we're all wearing makeup the chances are the women are fine applying and wearing makeup but most men aren't nearly comfortable enough to admit or use it sharks this happened to me on the day of my wedding the greatest day of my life and I woke up with is it and not just any zit as you can see I mean this thing was the mother of all zits okay it was a volcano it was just waiting to erupt yuck and while there were makeup artists there at the wedding I was too embarrassed to do anything about it and so my blemishes were there to stay for the thousands of photos that were taken that day every guy has an experience like this whether it's a first date an important pitch like here on Shark Tank or just coffee with a friend when you look your best you feel your best which is why she strix is changing the way that men can instantly fix their appearance with you guessed it it's makeup for men strix is the first company ever to engineer cosmetic and skin care products with completely custom formulations and packaging geared towards men we launched with a Sleek discreet and very sexy concealer tool and a tinted moisturizer and since then we've launched seven products at the intersection of cosmetics and skin care so that you can instantly fix your appearance including our energizing eye tool and our beard and brow gel comb so sharks who's ready to join us and show the world there's nothing wrong with handsome so we don't have pens in front of you it's actually our concealer tool so if you take a look there so we have it designed as a pen so that it's sleek and discreet so this is just a concealer correct right so let me start at the beginning what does concealer do and what are you supposed to do with it so the formulation is made so if you want to cover up a pimple if you want to cover up dark under eye circles you just dab it on and you're done so you don't need a primer a foundation a sponge a brush a setting powder it's made to be as easy as possible for guys to cover up any problems and with the concealer tool we found out one of the best uses for it the guys were using it for is for dark under eye circles like under eye bags and so that's what led us to launch the energizing eye tool which is also in front of you it tightens the skin underneath the eye so it's meant to reduce Fine Lines wrinkles and it's it's really an anti-aging type but how are you supposed to even know how to do it like to me it's like war paint you know you just like see a streak I mean now what really so that's a huge that's a huge thing that we need to work on as part of this brand is education around these people I actually used a product like this all the time of course I do I don't sleep enough so I get really bad guys there's lots of products eye creams everything that are made for men correct you're saying you're a brand new category what's the brand new category nobody's approached the Cosmetic category from this angle like for me when I was younger I was bullied out of my middle school because I put gel in my hair and that hit my confidence for years people bullied you because you put gel in your hair yeah oh yeah this was also I mean seriously I would love to hear though why this I mean were you guys chemists were you guys in this industry at all so no so when we first started I partnered with two professional makeup artists they helped us really be able to formulate the first ever really cosmetic products for men's skin as opposed to women so what had happened was is I raised half a million dollars to start before I raised wow a million dollars to launch the company who did you raise it from friends family and then connections especially the company did you give away for the 500 000. so at the time we raised at about you know a 1.5 million valuation how long ago was that that was back in 2018. okay and now you're at a 12 million valuation because you have amazing sales what are they so this year we're at about 130 000 per month that's it per month per month per month I knew it what's lifetime sales about 2 million 2 million okay how are you selling 130 000 a month well a big one is is d2c Ecom retail our own site so we're about 95 d2c and then last year we launched in CVS Nationwide we're the first men's cosmetic brand I'm amazed you got to see it yeah it was good for you for us like retail is really a validation point in CVS we actually sit in the shave aisle we're not in a cosmetic aisle we're not in the women's aisle so we wanted to show these products yeah it can be normalized what you sell them for what's your average selling price it's around 30 85 gross margins so why though why the value I mean because you do understand that the is probably a family that risks it all and they just need a shot and you know you took that space from them that's not fair to do that right every entrepreneur wants a shot right so another million dollar evaluation that doesn't matter look if it's going to be worth 200 million dollars in three days then it's cheap right but let me ask the difference it may be worth crap in two days yeah well so is every company facing that so let me ask you a question what is that much money at and give away basically a 30-year company at that point sorry I didn't hear that Mark are you saying when you raised a half a million you gave up one-third it was a little bit less than that we have raised more since then actually oh yes that's what I was getting to right now so how much do you guys own right now we between the two of us we own a little bit more than a third of the company okay so that's why you need such a high valuation because if you're asking for that much money well that's the only way you're going to retain any accidents so the total raise from beginning was how much historical right around one and a half million total raised wow if you do this run rate right now at 130 a month that's about 1.5 million in sales for this calendar a year how much you're going to make off we are not net profitable everything we're making is going right back into marketing are you losing money yeah how much uh depending on the month somewhere between 40 and 50K so let's find out why right because the margins are huge yes so if you're burning that much cash you are spending it somewhere yeah advertising or yep it's marketing primarily but we're expecting to see five to six x return on the acquisition cost now for sure why did you guys decide to go to retail because that takes a lot more capital in order to drive sell through whereas direct to Consumer you can get a return on ad spend and see it directly so why do you like the retail strategy mark because I wouldn't know about the product but if I go to a CVS in the Shaving aisle I'm going to see the product yeah but that's so extremely validating our number one competitor is the stigma here so for guys to see these products right next to other brands that they know and love interviews yeah but I'm not saying that's wrong right but one of the biggest things I try to teach my entrepreneurs is conserve your cash yeah because stuff happens and so you're gonna have to raise more than this six hundred thousand dollars too so now you guys are going to have to give away 10 15 20 of your 33 percent and then you guys are going to end up with nothing for me there's a huge elephant in the room and that is that this packaging tells me nothing about your product whatsoever and strix the name I have no idea it's makeup for men at all so you could probably be selling so much better if those things were clear on here and for those Reasons I'm out thank you the valuation is a little high I really rather work with people who needed a little bit more not second raisin and all that kind of money there's just not a business for me I'm out thank you thank you I love the category I mean I think it's been due for a long long time um but I don't like your approach you try to hide the fact that it's it's makeup a little bit I think you got to own it more because that's the only way you're going to change hearts and Minds if you can convince bro culture to do it you change everything I would take a completely different approach you know you guys have made your choices so for those Reasons I'm out thank you thanks I'm not going to tell you how to run your business I expect you to do that on your own I'm just an investor and I see a good idea I like it I don't like your valuation I don't think you're worth 12 million bucks okay sorry I just don't or I think there's a royalty coming yeah I think so it's because I understand your issue around your Capital needs if you're getting into retail with CVS and others you're going to get POS and it's tying up the capital the more you grow the more capital is tied up so the way I'm going to structure my offer is I'm going to give you 300 000 as a factoring loan 36 months 11.5 percent okay so the other 300 000 is equity for two and a half percent and putting a royalty on it on per package of two bucks until I get my 600 000 back because you can afford it and then it drops down to 25 cents in perpetuity which is nothing but I'm part of the game Kevin I think you actually hit a new low with this offer Robert not only are you being a loan shark you're also adding a royalty to it yeah I think this is the first time if you have a bad Equity listen it's an offer I don't hear any others what's your offer yeah I I think Kevin's double dipping on his offer with you guys sounds like triple or quadruple you've heard a lot of negatives about what you could do better but the one thing we can't argue with is the sales whatever you're doing it's working my advice would be this isn't the direction the guy on this picture is already buying makeup you've got to get somebody like me and I think you could do really really well is there an offer and all this garbage I mean we'll take compliments as well we take feedback and compliments I think the scariest thing about his offer is when you have a royalty in perpetuity who's going to buy that company right you got to do an equity deal I'll give you the 600 000 for 10 ouch I think getting a shark can really help you with the platform what an interesting dilemma you have Robert would we be able to meet in the middle at seven and a half I want to stick to the 10 I'm in this I don't want to go in for a short time I don't need a royalty I'm in it for the long run we're going to build something and let's go for it Mr Wonderful we really wanted to be on the wedding platform of love because the wedding story this is great for Grooms and groomsmen but Robert you got a deal good job guys I would never make fun of you for wearing a gel what's going on with that Michelle oh that was a great job guys good job guys congrats thank you thank you you know we really like had reasons we wanted each of the Sharks uh Robert's the most handsome though and he's going to help us show everybody there's nothing wrong with handsome men wouldn't make up it's like years ago when Botox was a taboo now you mention it in no way listen eyebrow one of the worst jokes ", "Kent": "first in the tank are entrepreneurs on a mission to expose a dirty little secret about the fashion industry let's learn a little bit about the entrepreneurs I'm Stacy I'm Jeff and we're from Los Angeles California I started working in fashion 10 years ago and really saw the amount of waste that is used in fashion as well as the amount of plastic that's used in apparel it ends up sitting in landfill for over 200 years breaking down into small microplastic pieces that pollute the Earth that would be the campaign tagline my career started off in advertising working for a big consumer packaged Goods Brands when I met Stacy I really had an itch do something entrepreneurial he brought such an amazing background I decided to bring him on board and help build the brands hi weeks ago we added a new member to our family when you're holding your son and you're looking into his eyes you realize it's not only important to create a successful business because we have another balcony but to create a more sustainable future for him and future Generations I gotta go to post office getting a deal with one of the Sharks is so vital we need the capital and expertise to help bring our business to the next level and also change the world hi sharks I'm Stacy and I'm Jeff husband of the boss we're here seeking 200 000 in exchange for five percent equity in our company sharks do you want to know a dirty little secret in the U.S millions of pounds of underwear end up in landfill every single day and to top it off most of our clothes are made with plastic-based Fabrics that's only bad for our bodies but bad for the Earth so what have I told you we could turn this into this wow but there's more what sharks Halo to Kent the world's first verified compostable underwear that's 100 plastic free and 100 organic so when their time is up you can literally plant your pants just pop them in the compost and then only 90 days they turn into nutrient-rich soil and best of all our trade sticker product design actually makes them stronger and softer the conventional underwear so sharks who's ready to revolutionize the apparel industry as we know it and help us turn fashion into fertilizer all right all right so and now it starts in front of you are your own Kent Basics and believe it or not the soil in your flower pot is actually Kent composted underneath from the underwear wow yeah in here yes yeah so they feel nice they feel like cotton underwear they're very stretchy they feel very good I actually feel a little bit thicker than what I expected yeah it's live TV but we were going to see like can we ask you guys to try them on or is that too risky [Applause] I think I think maybe we can [Applause] go look at that six-pack I don't like nothing like these guys all right so uh let me ask Jeff and Stacy uh you know you're a part of History this is the first Shark Tank live ever and you are the first are you nervous um nervous excited just thrilled and honored to be here yeah all right thank you thank you so much so how did you come up with this idea well I spent about 10 years in the fashion industry and noticed that even sustainable fashion brands combated two big problems one was landfill waste at the end of product life cycle and two was microplastic so despite using responsible materials spandex nylon a lasting polyester still heavily used in fashion particularly underwear and I myself couldn't find 100 natural underwear nor could my friends wow so how is Kent uh fully compostable and how is it different from regular cotton underwear yeah well it's a art we have a trade secret product design as we mentioned so organic chemical cotton is a big majority of that but to give it its lactic qualities that's the trade secret compost as you may not maybe not everyone America knows it's a man-made process right so it's not just like throw it in the dirt right you accomplish is something you have to kind of manage and and deal with in your backyard usually um but basically at the end of life you hopefully a long line is a very high quality product so it's not a lot of times people think composable means disposable that's a misperception yeah um so after our long life you will put it in your compost give it a few turns and about 90 days it'll break down into what's in here so what is the question what does it cost to make it what do you sell it for one pair so one pair we sell for 20 to 24 dollars depending wow that's a little higher is that a lot for underwear yeah that's a lot for these kinds it's slightly premium but I will say it's all made right here in America that's good and it's eight dollars and seven cents they are premium but what about sales how what's your aggregate sales here today uh so year to date we're at ninety nine thousand dollars first year two years ago we did 30 000 second year we did 120. so did you value this company at four million dollars well we're on page to do five yes this year yeah okay how do you sell this how do you sell it 85 is d2c e-commerce fifteen percent is through one wholesale partner and we're actually launching with another major retailer later this uh year with Nordstroms guys a question for you I have another company that's compostable Earth Brand they make cups right and you can't just throw it away like you said what happens if you don't put it into compost so this is a great question we know that everyone in America doesn't have access to a compost so we created the fashion industry's first compost take back program so you can send your kind of enter back to us who's going to send their old underwear how many people have sent their underwear back not many because it's lasting along because it's lasting a long time we're only two years old though so most people haven't no idea look the mission is great right what you're trying to do is amazing we need more of it every single product needs to be like this right every every single clothing product in particular but the challenge is when you're that small right you have to promote more promote all the things that have to take place in order for the composting to work right I think that's true Mark but I also think like the take that program is so that we can make good at you know to say hey if you live in a city you don't have a backyard but anyone with a backyard anyone that lives on a farm what are your margins today and how are you making any money we are about at break even right now we're running about 95 000 in sales you're breaking age this is we haven't hit Q4 yet which is a the lion pays to do 500 000 yeah Nordstroms we're launching 10 and we're also going into t-shirts all right guys I'll clear the deck right I think it's a great idea a great product I think at your size it's really going to be hard to convey what needs to be done in order for the composting to work so for those Reasons I'm out I think listen I got to be realistic about you like your numbers you're saying that you're worth 4 million you're making underwear for 8.50 and selling of a 24 the average American cannot afford that and you do not have the sales to say that this is really that so unfortunately this is another compost deal I'd like to make it an offer so much room to and then grow and that's the satisfaction of all business I had a company a single Product Company I bought into in the first two years how does this sound 100 million dollars in sales one product but I think the version 99 000 in Salem shocked at how little that is although I hope you get to the 500 but I'm your girl here's my offer I'm going to give you whoa oh hey Jeff you know what I'm curious about something you said audience who changes their underwear at least once a year let me know how many people all right [Applause] now I'm curious buys I'm curious about that big difference America how often do you buy new underwear text a b or c to 22854 now thank you [Applause] [Music] two sharks around Stacy and Jeff have one offer on the table for their compostable underwear company Kent but Robert wants to know how often does America buy new underwear the results are in 54 of our home viewers polled buy new underwear every year or two every year at two volume guys Stacy I'm a big believer in an entrepreneur let me ask you this why should I or any of the Sharks invest in you so when I started this company I was told no by everybody people said that this product could not be made in general or could not be made in America and this was something that I believed in so personally because myself my friends women needed this product and I was in relationships in the past with someone who didn't believe in me I eventually met Jeff who did believe in me and we have put all of our kind of evenings weekends vacations our bootstrap this business [Applause] I know how hard it is to start a business and I'm not going to say no to you today because I believe in what you guys have built you're not getting enough credit 99 000 sales half a million this year let's go baby all right here's my offer and I am not greedy like Barbara over there I will give you the 200 000 for 15 because I believe [Applause] two hundred thousand five percent imputes a 4 million valuation that's insane I love your Kumbaya story I hate your valuation our evaluation is based on an 8X multiple I'm out okay all right thank you do you guys have a patent on this so we went the trade secret route because that's smart we are a fashion product with multiple Secrets all right all right listen I was going to give you an offer but I've changed my mind all right if you can do this with t-shirts I'm in because t-shirts I think are bigger than underwear I'm gonna offer you 200 000 for 15 same as him equal offer okay what are you gonna do what are you gonna do is there will not be up stood I'm gonna give you the same offer as the other two sharks 15 you pick one of us everybody's back uh obviously you are the fashion Guru uh when we came here tonight that was a very you were someone we targeted um is there any any combination of sharks that you guys want to work I don't need them I don't need them for what I'm gonna take you no you got to make it yeah he made me the fashion girl I've done the most investments in Fashion on this show since seasons [Applause] there you go [Applause] foreign ", "Oogiebear": "foreign next up is an easy solution to a hard to reach problem [Music] [Applause] [Music] here's something about the entrepreneurs [Applause] I'm Nina and I'm Cena and we're from Potomac Maryland we have three kids my idea started with my eldest Ariana when she was a baby she would not sleep through the night she kept waking up and had breathing issues as a mom I've knew that there was a need but I just thought I was crazy I thought it was just me having this problem I am a periodontist my expertise deals with sinus oral cavity and Airway I've been a pharmacist for over 20 years but I've learned all my business Knowledge from watching Shark Tank I consider myself a graduate of Shark Tank University this business is truly a family business my kids are part of every aspect from shipping to social media there are little sharks in training we're not just a product our mission is to provide Awareness on the importance of nose breathing we've gotten here with guts and courage now we need a shark to help us scale this business we're ready to jump in the tank and Boogie [Music] hi sharks my name is Nina farza and I'm her husband Cena Farson and we're here asking for four hundred thousand dollars for five percent of our company ah whoa if any of you sharks ever picked a baby's nose before yep some of you may know that babies can't blow their nose and when they're stuffed up it's hard for them to eat and breathe our babies suffered from boogers yes them up all the time leading to countless sleepless nights for both Us and Them unfortunately everything on the market was for wet mucus but that wasn't our problem and that inspired me to create Oogie bear the first baby booger picker I designed a Yogi Bear scoop and Luke to tackle all types of boogers our signature bear head design isn't just cute it helps prevent the tips from going in too far allowing parents to be in and out quickly it worked so great we knew we had something special sharks we promise whoever picks Oogie bear will sleep like a baby knowing that they're helping babies and parents breathe easier wow so and I never imagined products I see a lot of other products designed yes you have the original Oogie bear nose picker which is which one so right there in your hands the smallest one and then you have the bright which is the Oogie bear with a light on it you got it yeah and then you have the toothbrush tether 360 which is the one exactly wow and then finally you have our version of the aspirator bar I have a question for Nina you're a full-time pharmacist why did you leave that to come up with this question I think that's what my parents were asking as well I they were very disheartened when I told them I'm leaving my executive position yes but um I I left because I think um I want to say it was a dare but honestly it was I think I would come I was coming up with a whole bunch of ideas and one day Cena was like you know my my nephew needed this and I looked at him I said I'm bringing this to Market and he just looked at me and said let's see you try and that's just for you that's what it takes yeah there's a message to everybody you just gotta try it you got to do it Nina what is it what is it what does it cost you to make it and what do you sell it for so it costs the range that you see there anywhere between land at two dollars and four dollars to make it and we sell it from 12.99 to 24.99. guys what age group what age group is this set for so we Market it from zero to 24 months because that's when really they cannot pick their nose but I was using my prototype uh the actual prototype on my side until he was like he's going to be so embarrassed I'm going to say this but until he was like five years old he's so embarrassed right now he's gonna kill me I'm so sorry I love I love the boogers but we got to talk sales okay lifetime sales and then what have you what are you gonna do in this 12 months this has evaluation of eight million dollars though Kevin I know but that's why I'm yes I'm freaking out yeah to date I have sold over 1 million units of this long have you guys been in business and what is your last this year okay so 2015 we started total revenue sales over 15 million dollars [Applause] have you made any money are you margin enough to make profits well this year I'm on a track to make one million dollars [Applause] hang on are you gonna sell a million this year are you going to make a million I'm making a million [Applause] Revenue sales this year we're on track to make 5.4 last year we made 4.5 and next year a no increase in distribution will make six points you're killing it I am killing it but you know what I learned all of this from you guys I've been watching you Barbara I've been watching you when you had Ava the elephant way back I don't know what happened to that product but I should have been here I didn't have distribution I had that's when I actually made my first party tonight stop right there I want to pick my nose with you and you know I've got to tell you I think it's so fascinating that you started with one idea and now you have a whole bunch of different products are there more coming so Laura I like to say that we're now a family of smart baby products because our smart design you can see there are other ways that we've used a smart design in helping parents and we have the baby's point of view let me tell you something I'm extremely impressed because I thought you were going to come up here and I thought your numbers and sales were going to be snot much but uh this is uh incredible but I got I got to tell you something this is just not in my area of expertise and I think the other sharks that probably are better with this but congratulations I'm impressed but I'm out thank you I really appreciate it is there any competition like are there any knockoffs of this any competition so I actually developed a whole new baby care product a whole like no yeah I want to say that category huh yeah we modernized the way that people clean their baby's nose and ears there was nothing like this on the market as a pharmacist I knew better nothing addressed boogers and it's the most important thing because it involves babies breathing better so yes we have Knockouts because they were making we're killing it so we're we do have knock-ups but nobody can because we have a patent on our scoop so we have a Utility Patent and a design pen and nobody really can good for you where are you guys where are you selling these at where where are you selling them so we are so in uh Nordstrom's Bye Bye Baby what about online on your own site yes we do and that's where we need your help because we need what percentage of your sales right now is online on your site and are you selling on Amazon yeah so yeah so are you selling on Amazon we are and what percentage is there uh it's about 76 I would say oh so 76 of your sales yeah oh so that's a lot it is yeah it is and we want you to diversify our Revenue we

to your daily [Music] life hi sharks my name is Brian brunsing and I'm from Buffalo New York I'm Max Brown also from Buffalo New York we're seeking $250,000 for 10% of our company sharks there are three well-known problems that need to be fixed when it comes to the 9 to-5 work life one it's too boring and two with all the constant push notifications emails and text messages establishing real human connection is almost impossible and three and this one's Universal there's just not enough fun in the world and that's bananas that's why we created Banana Phone Banana Phone is a banana-shaped Bluetooth handset that connects to your smartphone so you can talk to your friends family or the IRS on a banana we like to think of it as a phone with appe peel baked into this Delicious Design is everything you need to spark real conversations once paired with your smartphone this robust banana is ready to receive calls at the push of a button yellow or you can initiate calls by clicking the multi-function button twice and saying call the Banana Man calling Mark Cubit you can also show off your Wildside by bumping your favorite tunes by using your banana phone as a speaker and we banana split a portion of our proceeds with the gorilla conservation gearing up for gorillas it's potassium with a purpose what can we say talk more smile more save gorillas and help us make talk and cool again with banana phone what did you guys do before you got into the bananas I work for visa and this is a project that I've been investing tons of late nights weekends uh in around the clock work just so this is a side hustle this is a side hustle correct got it by day I'm president of Garrett leather we're the world's largest Italian upholstery leather supplier how long have you been in business uh we've been in business for 6 years 6 years do we have a banana phone in here you should certainly you should check it out if 6 years old hit us with a little sales sure so we've done over $1.6 million in lifetime sales $400,000 in net income what did you do last year last year was $540,000 in sales uh net income last 12 months was $123,000 you it's more than I I thought when was the aha moment you're in 2016 I was sitting at my desk with a banana in my hand trying to blow off a colleague saying I'm really busy and I said oh my God this has to exist after a quick Google search after a quick Google search I realized that it didn't and after a quick Instagram search I realized that there were 45,000 other people who were making that joke at the same time and there's a shark in this room who's made that joke as well Barb oh yeah all the time you remember that Barbara what it cost if I want to buy it online and what it cost you to land it so this nanner cost $39.99 retail oh that's a big banana our landed cost is $6 a unit do you have a patent uh we did not pursue a design patent because they're notoriously easy to copy and to knock off so we pursued a trademark to protect our brand but Max just to be clear it's not a phone you need to pair with a pH you just pair your banana to your Apple thank you robt guys let me ask you this you did 540,000 last year your total lifetime sales over 6 years were 1.2 what shifted to get your sales to go boom in the last two years we've shifted to a robust direct to Consumer advertising strategy leveraging Facebook Instagram Tik Tok Google it sounds very expensive how much are you spending on that we're spending $9 per customer is that your customer acquisition it's n bucks what we are seeing is that we hit people with a targeted advertising for high impulse conversions and and then when they get the phone there's a virality to it because they're posting on social media but nobody's full-time on this business correct are you willing to give up your careers to support the banana that's the question if we have a strategic partner who's willing to work with us and leverage it absolutely tell me what you're going to do with the $250,000 the next Horizon for us is getting into brick and mortar retail and so we have I think that this thing screams to be in the Beyond section at Bed Bath and Beyond H guys you know I think what you're trying to do in retail is beyond insane I'm sorry it's not going to work this is a very eclectic category I do not need a banan phone in my portfolio this is not a product for me I'm out you guys took a fruit and turned it into money in your pocket giving you $250,000 means you've got to make $2.5 million in profits for me just to get my money back it's a great personal business but it's not a great fit for me so for those Reasons I'm out thank you so much for your consideration M we really appreciate it congratulations so many people have the idea but nobody ever puts it in play I'm just thinking of waking up one day and saying I in the Banana Phone business and I'm not sure I see a scalable business for an investor I'm out um I'm not really an investor in kitsy like novalty products that much because I think that they have a a spike and then a a fall it's not really the right product for me so I'm sorry I'm out you know I would just object to in investing in your business for one reason only which is I don't want you working on this part-time 1/2 and 1/2 doesn't equal three all right it will not grow if you do that it doesn't make sense so I'm out thank you for your consideration you guys good luck you so thank you all bye who is that somebody calling cuz they just saw us on Shark Tank and they want to place a massive order uh-huh Hey Kevin guess what I just just a mess in a banana this sucks gorillas don't want this believe me ", "Stealth Bros & Co.": "next up is a brand that merges function with style [Music] hi sharks my name is Braxton Fleming and I'm from Mays Landing New Jersey and I'm seeking two hundred thousand dollars in exchange for 15 Equity of my company six years ago the trajectory of my whole life changed I realized I was transgender with this realization came with the lifelong commitment of taking hormone replacement therapy in the form of injections during my first year of transitioning there was nowhere to properly store my medical needs in a safe neat discreet yet stylish way that's where stealth pros and Co revolutionized the way that we store our meds and dispose of our sharps this was born out of my own need as a trans man but I realized there were multiple underrepresented medical communities who needed this product that's a diabetic or maybe you know someone going through infertility treatment a child with injectable needs or even cisgendered individuals gone through hormone replacement therapy all of these underrepresented medical communities need options to travel with confidence for easy and proper at-home storage that's where our Dopp kits and sell sharp shuttles come in and save the day it's time to upgrade your plastic bags and your old jugs and store your meds in luxury so sharks who wants to fill the void of millions of people and take a shot with still frozen Coke let's go we can have a look at this here absolutely please open up your bags and take a look at what you have what do we have in front of us okay so what you have in front of you is a junior Dopp kit and a stealth sharp shuttle inside so the junior adopt kit that you have is our foundational Junior Dopp kit which is in line with our sword interior and then Lori you have our premium Dopp kit which is made with our vegan faux leather so your medicines and everything can go in here the vials yes that so a Sharps is part of your injectable needs it's a biohazard container use the needle I put it in here yes so you just pop this top open like this and then it can close and you can open it and close it multiple times once it's filled then you want to take that little latch at the top stick it in that compartment and then it locks permanently and then you can discard it appropriately so this is the Disposable aspect of the needles yes but there's only one come with your kit I would think you'd be using these like crazy so yes we actually offer them in bundles so you could buy it for one three or five on my website and we just received a major purchase order from a large retailer and they will be sold in a bundle pack of four there are other Dopp kits for injectables right because I've seen plenty yes and so you just made them more fashionable more fashion looking correct and same with the sharps absolutely what was missing from the other kids and is it what Mark said you just made it more fashionable and cool and what was missing was the effect that it was daunting to take the injections for me even though I'm a nurse I've been a nurse for the past 11 years I realized that yes I give injections every day but when I was watching the YouTube videos online of my community taking these injections I was realizing how much anxiety was bringing it was bringing them and once I created something that organized everything for them they weren't all over the place I want to bring an experience to the user I want them to feel good about themselves and this brings happiness to my community and that's what I'm to your community how do you sell the product so I sell the product all through e-commerce and I just been growing organically through influencer and now would be a good time to ask you how much have you sold year to date currently we're at a hundred and ten thousand and last year what did you do Braxton we did 147 000 so we're up 40 percent currently right now what does this cost to make and what do you sell it for okay so the one that you have costs five dollars and eighty cents for me and then I sell it for 34. thirty four dollars it is for one of these okay and what you're going to sell the one three and four pack I guess okay so if we buy over 10 thousands pieces of that it's at 28 cents and then we sell them for four dollars on the website and then if you buy a pack of five it's fifteen and what are you going to sell for wholesale to the retailer so I sell it to them for 750 and then they're reselling it for 14.99 so 750 for a pack of four and it cost you 28 cents yes thank you Mark's going to start selling them Braxton can you tell us a little bit about yourself and your background and absolutely absolutely so I actually come from two entrepreneurial parents and um as I was growing up I was very accepted in my family you know my parents love me they never judge me they let me be whoever I wanted to be and at the age of 27 years old I said something is missing from my life and that's when I realized that I was transgender and once I made that change as I was watching YouTube videos of other trans men taking hormone replacement injections that's how I realized that there was a need for this and I was indirectly assessing them with my nursing skills saying oh that's not safe like they're putting in shoe boxes they're putting it in plastic bags and that's when I said you know what I really want to become a part of my community because they've given me so much that I wanted to give back I created this brand and it just blew up is it just you running the business it's all me I do everything I literally work out of my basement right now I have all my product down there or you're still doing this completely out of your basement yes and are you nursing still or yes actually been trying to slow down because I've been putting more effort into the business I'm just curious the logo stealth brothers and Company when you came out here I thought it's a great name now now that we know we don't understand it it's great I'll explain the name stealth is because I wanted people to be able to keep their medication discreet no I get the stealth part why the brothers were built on the foundation of the Brotherhood of f to M female to male Brotherhood and then enco is and communities that we keep our Allied communities that's great and then the swords are there for because iron sharpens iron and more than one Community coming together makes you better and stronger and you have that up on your website the explanation I actually do not you should cool thank you that's very cool and there should be a video there of you explaining it because the power of how you just explained it yes yeah that comes across very very well thank you I think that kind of the perfect kit Community I say that I rarely say it I think you should run this I think you should take all the profit and I think you should grow step by step and you're going to have a wonderful business and reap what you sow and for those reasons I wish you good luck but I'm thank you Lori I appreciate it so Brax up the greatest part of your business not to diminish the other parts of your business is really you I mean you exude an incredible warmth thank you and Personnel the the draws people to you thank you I think you've

big shot right it was just as big as this yeah the big plungeon was made of oil that burned that's horrible uh but the ingenious ways I had to come up with just to hide that not that I was ashamed but what do you do with the damn needle right you know my life had to go on I used to carry books with me cut out pages in the middle cut a page like a stop wow the carry the book and stick the needles in there because you can't dispose in a restroom you can't throw it in a garbage can but let me tell you something you you have genuine warmth and love that your pitch comes from feel it all over it and

team behind the Louisville today we're seeking a 250 000 investment in exchange for five percent equity in our company wow sharks we're here to get you hooked on crochet our company is we make fun simple kits that teach you how to crochet but instead of a boring pot holder you'll learn how to make adorable characters like here and Felix the Fred designo and Sebastian the lion each kit comes with step-by-step videos that teach complete beginners how to crochet our secret we're not just a crochet company we see ourselves as an education company too we've seen that something magical happens when people learn a new skill it's about confidence so sharks who's ready to wobble with us super cute super cute what you have in front of you is both the kit and an example of the Wubble that you would make with this kit and if you open up the pouch then you'll see our easy peasy yarn and then most importantly there's a card inside of the pouch that has a link in a QR code that brings you to our website tutorial our customers will follow to learn how to make that wubble what is the age start for this so most people look at our product and think that it's for kids but most of our customers are actually adults buying it for themselves and what do you sell these for and what do they cost you to make landed they're three dollars we wholesale for 15 and we retail for 30. how do you sell them over 90 of our sales are direct to Consumer straight from our website why did you crochet in the first place before I started the Wubble balls to lead user experience for Google classroom and I spent the bulk of my career as a ux designer working on education products and I love my job I was great at it I was so great that they made me a manager and it turns out I sucked at being a manager to take my mind off of work I started dabbling in all these other hobbies and crochet was one of those things and learning to crochet reminded me that I still have it in me to learn something new that I could try to become a better manager and so that experience of really building back my confidence through crochet is why we started this I want to share that experience are you still at Google oh no no no this is a 100 full-time full-time for both of you yeah from a really young age I've been taught that success means getting good grades going to a good school and getting a really high paying job and that's exactly what I did so I became one of the youngest directors on Wall Street I traded billions of dollars in equities but I wasn't any happier at the end of it than when I started and when I began to realize was that I had spent all that time working towards someone else's definition of success and so I left it all behind to go and try and figure out what my own definition of success is I knew from a really young age that I really liked helping people and then when we started thinking about crochet kits what's really neat about it is that it is that confidence boost sometimes as we get older you kind of stop learning new things you start saying things like you know I'm too old to learn that and so what brings me joy with these kids is that they're a little confidence boost to remind you that you can always learn something new so exactly two years ago we started this business we took 200 we bought some yarn and we bought a domain name and since then we've done 5.3 million dollars wow that's incredible here in a date we've done 3.1 million we assume that we've just stopped growing from this point on out we'll do seven million dollars this year okay your direct consumer which means you're doing a lot of online advertising so tell us what your cost to acquire these revenues are what your gross margins are and what your net margins are yeah so we spent about 20 percent of our revenue on Advertising okay that's not bad it costs us a blended cack of Sixteen dollars the average order value is around fifty Seven dollars okay wow they order one kit or more than one kit so that's about two kids then you're making a lot of money so 86 percent gross margin 32 percent uh net margin Lifetime and 38 year-to-date great margins so why do you need 250 I mean you're killing it we're here for three reasons we're here for a licensing wholesale and mentorship when it comes to licensing when a customer finishes the kit the first thing they think is I need to get another kit and they start asking us where's baby Yoda do you have any Disney characters where are the Marvel characters at guys how did you arrive at your evaluation did you presented we know our valuation is very low um it's low because it's very low because we are here to make a deal we can learn so much from this group of people in this room and the way we see it we have two huge opportunities ahead of us we haven't even begun to talk about wholesale but licensing and wholesale we think and drive this brand to the next level we want to go to retail we want to go to retail because they have enough margin we've done a test order so now we get a little more about what what the mission really is is the basis or the mechanism for that learning in Your Vision always going to be crochet meaning is the next product that you have coming a non-crochet or some other form yes the the key to our business is the learn what we apply it to can change but right now we are 100 percent focused on so for the foreseeable future it's crochet kids exactly I like the steel okay because it has something I love called Cash Flow and so I see it this way I think I can reduce your costs of acquiring customers by around eight to ten percent number two I can definitely help you with licensing been there done that with lots and lots of Brands I also think I can help you with some other interesting ideas in the fashion world with this stuff okay the Fashion World you want to hear the offer or not you the 250 000 for 10 Equity coming from you Mr Wonderful I expected to hear the words you have cash cash flow would it be okay if we just heard that if any of the other sharks are interested I would definitely I'll give you 300 . thank you I love this I'm gonna make you an offer I'm going to go 300 000 for 10 percent I I understand all of this I mean I've been in this market so much and I know how to get all the things you talked about from the licensing to the retail stores I think you should be everywhere and fast because you are something that could really take off that's our mission we want to spread the joy and confidence of learning something new I'm going to give you 350 000 for 10. three hundred thousand for eight percent okay this mentoring is going to be worth it guys you understand all the offers right you got to make a decision hold it a second just hold it a second I'm going to give you the 350 for five percent that's how much I believe in your business you are sitting on a rocket but you have to let me know right away because I'm being a fool here bidding against myself which would do is Mark come on countered for eight I can do this all alone we've read your book and we know we've seen what you've been able to do I think that if you would team up with another shark what was the amount you gave us 350 the 350 for six percent Robert are you going to do anything here trying to get a word in here I mean it's hard I'm just saying how can I get a piece of this make an offer yeah I'd love to be involved so we're going to give you 450 for six percent two of us together guys you understand all the offers right you got to make a decision if we take a moment yes we can you can thank you Okay so each shark offers a lot of different value in different areas and where we think in the short term that we can really get the most help is with Mark and Lori I want to let you know that like you mean so much to me but but for the company I think you're going to abandon me like that that's what they want to do 450 thousand six percent you guys got a deal oh I've had it now oh my God sharks we did not prepare for that when it worked out it was definitely a risky move to Barbara and Mark and get Lori in there instead and we're glad that it worked out walk I bring you into the deal if you didn't even want the deal I was pushing it for the deal you were my partner I never for a moment feel like you throw me out of the bus and go with Lori I really feel like that's the difference I knew Lauren ", "Turbo Trusser": "me neither is awesome next in the tank is a tool to ensure you get a juicy bird every time [Music] hello sharks I'm Brian and I'm Kirk and we're here from the home of the Pro Football Hall of Fame Canton Ohio we're here seeking one hundred thousand dollars for a 10 stake in our company sharks have you ever cooked a chicken that was so dry it was barely edible or served a turkey at Thanksgiving that was so parched your guests wanted offered in a drink well that's why we created the turbo trusser the turbo trusser is a rapid trusty device used when cooking whole chickens and turkeys trusting is a technique that trusting is a technique that keeps the wings and legs close to the body it Cooks a bird more evenly good save traditionally this is done with butcher's wine which is messy and hard to work with and this is for the birds but with the turbo trouser keeping your dinner nice and juicy is a breeze just hook the turbo trusser right into place closing up the cavity and sealing all the juices to cook a perfect bird check out these incredible results sharks you'll get a delicious juicy chicken or turkey every time this product is so Universal you can use it in ovens grills smokers Roasters rotisseries deep fryers and hack even air fryers and best of all it's made of food grade stainless steel and it's dishwasher safe and it's made right here in the good old USA so which one of you sharks wants to take a bite out of the poultry industry so eat 20 sharks on your table you have samples of our two versions one is a chicken turbo trusser and one is made for turkeys and then you also have some chicken that was cooked with the turbo truster today Kevin we'd love to have you come up go ahead and try it out we've got a chef hat you know I am Chef wonderful that's right it is very good it's good okay you just pick the the turbo trusser up yeah and set it in the butt there okay you set it in the butt set it in the butt and then okay yep oh there we go lift one leg up and put it in just that easy just that easy good on the other side do the same what is the chicken Community saying about this torture device they really like it we've sold about 11 000 units and had one return very nice to get your hands all messy when you're using butcher's twice how much of this delicious juiciness is because of this or the way you cooked it in that particular because of the turbo truster that's what trussing does it Cooks it so you're cooking one piece of meat instead of five so it's going to cook more evenly I don't cook so I'm learning so much because everybody do this you know what I think a lot of people do but I think people are one afraid to do it with twine because it's it's intimidating to tie up a dead chicken I'd be like normally got to go online watch a five or ten minute video okay so guys how did you get here you know how did you get in chicken soup Shark Tank on the carpet for the last 18 years I've been working in the pharmaceutical industry I've worked for three of the largest pharmaceutical companies in the world but Kirk and I we met about five or six years ago that he was renovating my house Kirk I was a contractor for 20 years I went to culinary school back in the early 90s I was a sous chef and a couple uh big banquet kitchens and country clubs but I got burnt out and that's how I got in the Contracting as a contractor I found a problem with straight shutoff valves I invented a wrench that has over 800 positions and I have about two utility patents and I think five design patents on it and I ended up licensing it and then Brian's like I want to start inventing too this is really cool and I'm like okay well let's do it into chicken soups right we've invented personally together six products four in the barbecue industry two in the pet industry and then he's got a wrench before this product did you make any money let's get back to this product for a second how how much does it cost how much do you make it for how many of you sold so right now it costs well on our last order it was three dollars and seven cents to make MSRP is 14.99 and how many of you sold in dollars 9 80 thousand dollars in sales so we've been in business for eight and a half months sixty percent of our sales come from our website alone twenty seven percent of our sales go through Distributors we have three Distributors we're in 75 stores now oh you are in houses selling is it selling through yep selling through all three of our Distributors have reordered our Amazon we have somebody that's selling on Amazon for us now he's reordered three times Brian I love you guys I love this thing I know nothing about it it's just not big enough for me don't chicken out not yet our margin is 82 percent [Music] Kurt I love it not for me thank you thank you for your time how would I make money on a deal like this it seems like a little business a little bit of sales doesn't seem like there's room for a third person by any means Barbara that's a great question there's 87 million turkeys are consumed just between the three holidays of Thanksgiving Easter and Christmas we're not online marketing experts right so we're looking for somebody that can help us with some marketing get us some social media exposure but guys look it's hard to connect your product to all those turkeys and chickens I just don't see you being able to scale which makes it really difficult as an investor so for those Reasons I'm out so it's not really investable for me it's not big enough and I really hate touching chicken so I just have to be honest about it but I think you'll do really well we appreciate that feedback Brian it's not a big enough business for an investor to make money I'm out Brian you've got you've got one turkey left you know guys I look at this and I see the potential of it but it's so much work we don't want you guys to do the work for us we're going to do the work listen we're here we won't let you down we just imagine if that wonderful took this under his wing we would love to have you under them but he ain't free he's an expensive Chef I mean I wish

your own castle hello sharks my name is Kevin Lane and I'm Lori Lane from New Milford Connecticut we are seeking $350,000 for 10% equity in our company create a castle everybody loves to vacation at the beach I know that I could lay in the Sun for hour hours with our daughter our son would stay in the water all day if we let him and if you're anything like my husband here you like to spend hours and hours and hours ignoring his family building the most elaborate sand castles but it's impossible to build a real sand castle using the traditional fill and flip buckets the wet sand sticks in the bucket even at its best it just looks boring that's why we invented Crea a castle revolutionary split mold sand castle kits that allow you to build elabor liate sand structures in no time at all just Buckle it pack it unbuckle it and well create a castle our Pro kit includes a 10-in cylinder for the base a coral to add a new level of intricacy a stackable 6-in piece for additional height a ridge Battlement brick form to add to the towers and a window cutter to Edge out elegant windows then sit back relax and enjoy the admiration of everyone on the beach so sharks who wants to create an empire with us bringing families together one castle at a time with create a castle I have six kids I'm a mom and bonus mom to six kids okay so we spend a lot of time on the beach and I love this is there anything like this out there cuz I feel like I've seen something similar nothing like this we're unique in the fact that we split so the mold split in half but they also are stackable on the right kind of sand you build that entire Castle yep how long does that take that took me under 2 hours wow I see patent do you want to tell us about that yes so go ahead we have yeah we have 12 patents worldwide 12 wow 12 does your patent you believe that protects you and anybody who wants to start splitting their to open we we have broad coverage it scales up and down that's why we're going down into the indoor line now as well all right guys look this is a very very seasonal product it works in the snow oh than you yeah so it does it works year round we figured that out the first year we did it and you can stack like crazy it's like Elsa's castle in the winter that's really really who wants a castle in a winter but else so guys what are the price ranges what's the least and what's the most so we go the tool kit that we had there the small box that's $10 and then the pro kit retails for $50 what's your landed cost on those um the little one is landed at $2 the pro kit that cost us $9.45 so what did you sell last year you're imputing a value of a 3.5 million on this last year we did 600,000 and then this year we are doing 3 million 3 million wait a minute how did that just Happ you kiding we we landed Costco Canada as well as Sam's Club on the 600,000 in sales last year what did you make on that we were actually negative 100,000 we lost money last year why and that was really due to the shipping cost were like 5x what we had budgeted because of Co yeah like we used to get a container in for you know 4 to 6,000 and you know a couple of our containers last year were 25,000 the three and the 3 million in sales including the Costco and Sam's Club ordered what do you think you'll make on that this year we're going to make about 300,000 what is your margin to Costco then the margin we made about um 27 to 32 2% Mark part of your challenge okay what are you looking for help for cuz right now it looks like you are scaling really well I honestly need to reduce cost but what else are you looking for I think mostly we need you know with the the capital that we're asking for to invest into more product and we just need expertise we've made so many mistakes and we're we're expanding into a whole we want to open up a whole licensing version what a licensing version did you say Damon oh you're looking for $350,000 I'm going assume that's primarily for inventory and you're trying to figure out the Costco order translating into a US Costco order correct cuz a lot of people test up in Canada are you sure that you can make money off of that order yeah not necessarily I mean we've learned a lot getting into the big box are you going to make money on the Costco order cuz they're going to ask you for some co-op advertising as well right for that markdowns and everything yeah we you know we know we have they have the right to return the last 15% of it yes you had sounds like you've had returns and markdowns yes yes we've been impacted your 27% margins even worse yes yeah guys I think there's too much of an emphasis on sales rather than profits every entrepreneur gets really hyped about doing business with big box retailers but the reality is it's just going to take more and more cash like you found out and so you know chasing margin and profits is good chasing sales in my mind particularly in this these uncertain days is bad and so for those reasons amount okay guys guys let me tell you where I'm at I'm looking at the business model strict strictly as an investment anytime it's 350,000 that's serious Capital I'm not even going to beat you up on the 3.5 million valuation although I should it's in my DNA to do that but I'm going to hold back because I'm under anger management this year so at the end of the day uh it's not investable yet because the business model isn't nailed down my sense is to dump the low in completely raise the prices 30% sell only on your own website Direct otherwise you're never going to make any money I'm out okay thank you listen I I don't agree with what he just said your price point I think is excellent and I have always found I like to make products for the masses I like to make things where everybody can afford and enjoy it but I think for me it's not something that I want to invest in I don't invest in everything that I like you're doing everything right and I wish you good luck but I'm out I absolutely absolutely love this product it brings me joy and I love your price point and I actually totally disagree with Kevin I think you want a balance of wholesale and Retail now coming from a retailer myself who sells an omni Channel I sell wholesale I sell direct to Consumer online and I have my own retail stores I think you can do it very thoughtfully now some of the discount retailers I will agree with Kevin can absolutely kill you so being thoughtful about where you go but I think you've got a home run I'm going to give you an offer I'm going to give you 350,000 but I don't think your valuation 3.5 million you lost $100,000 last year so I don't see the 3.5 but I do see that there's going to be great potential and opportunity I'd like to give you 350,000 for 20% and I think I can help you with that Omni Channel which I do think is going to help you build the business the way you want to build it okay awesome wait where wait hold on I like this uh but Mark has a valid point you know this is going to be your personal decision right do you uh raise the price stay online and you know net more or you want to go big do you bring in a shark and you go big but if you go big it's a huge cash suck massive so I'm only interested in this for the licensing aspect that's a personal decision but I will give you the $350,000 for 25% and Licensing is the key you know look I disagree with Damon I don't think this is just a licensing play and I don't see why you guys can't be the next big toy manufacturer so that's what I want to do I want you to dream big and I think I can help you get there by the way when I say dream big I'm talking about dreaming big what do you want to do did you guys ever work together with the licensing I would love to work with but in this area I'm the most successful licensed guy up here that's my area and I'm a brand Builder I built my own brand right from the ground up out of my extra bedroom so I'm going to interpret that for you they said no they don't want to work together what do you want to do you can [Music] counter you want to counter yeah would you be interested at 15% I'd like to stay at 20 okay I'm going to let you make the call she makes a decision you think or do you want to do I respect both of you all of you guys anyways absolutely but I think we're going to go with Kendra at sorry let's make some s castles together ex oh my God con guys well done thank you guys sorry Damon thank you so much one of the reasons we went with Kendra is from the GetGo when we walked in there she was so excited about the products and totally was invested in us and you know talked about the beach and her kids so we knew she would be the perfect f for us I love this product it's very cute I love it and I'm going to use it with my kids that that's some massively that's a that's a bad deal you know I mean I just I just think I think they're a bad judge of character I'm going to go try to build it back up oh go ahead we'll wait that ", "Mama O's Premium Kimchi": "next in the tank is an ancient food with modern health [Music] benefits hi sharks how you doing my name's kademo I'm the founder of Mama O's premium kimchi based out of New York City and to the left of me is a living legend my mom mama o hi shars hi along with my beautiful and very pregnant wife Amy who could not be here today we are the owner operators of Mama O's premium kimchi we are seeking $250,000 for a 10% Equity stake so sharks everyone knows k kimchi is delicious but did you also know it's super nutritious kimchi is an ancient super food from Korea it is naturally fermented and is full of probiotics that's right kimchi's health food but more importantly it tastes incredible and not just with Korean food either kimchi goes great with hamburgers hot dogs mac and cheese the list goes on what makes our kimchi the best is our authentic Korean mom recipe kept fresher than other brands by our Innovative Packaging in addition we invented the first and most complete homemade kimchi kit what used to take over 3 hours now you can do in less than 10 minutes because all the grinding mixing measuring juicing chopping and shopping is already in the jar just like my mom used to make and it comes out perfect every time it's a lot easier than you think so sharks who's interested in fermenting some money while augmenting your tummy with Mama O's premium kimchi good job I love kimchi Damon if you wouldn't mind as a fellow New Yorker would you help Mama own make some kimchi on stage using our kit absolutely it will be an [Music] honor Hi D today you're going to turn this mama o premium kimchi kit to Mama with premium kimchi it's like sex education but spicier please put on this rubber gloves thank you you normally need rubber gloves during sex education for Kim you start with a head of Napa cabbage called pachu in Korean P all right I've already cut one and brind overnight next add on of kimchi paste scoop it out with your fingers as much as you can take out okay that's enough that's okay that's enough now let's mix just gently toss it gently tenderly lovingly I'm getting turned on Damon that's it it's ready for fermentation but some of us enjoy just made fresh kimchi and eat it like salad a a that's sweet now we put it in the kimchi uh jar and it looks like this so what is this right here this is an airlock that makes your kimchi breathe while it's fermenting it's so amazing thank you I feel so so war and fuzzy now a Daman first of all thank you sharks uh you have a sample of what we're offering we have four different kimchi the kimchi paste and uh Kim chili hot sauce which I didn't even mention in the pitch yet I thought it was only just one type actually there are hundreds of types of kimchi but the one that most people know are and familiar with are napa cabbage we have the original vegan version mild version did you try this war you about the super spicy is like it's really hot I want to know about you guys like how did you come up with this idea I needed some kimchi for myself and uh I live in New York my folks live in Maryland so it's too far to go to Maryland to bum a jar so I would bring it back in this exact cooler our family cooler and back then I would wheel it home on my skateboard wow so I asked my mom to teach me how to make it and then I was buying some ribs and the butcher's like ah you eat with that with some kimchi and rice eating like a king So I said to him you know I sell this stuff I did and he said I want to start carrying it now we are nationwide through Whole Foods we just got into how much does it cost to make and how much did you sell it for it costs us $2.65 to make a bag of kimchi and it retails from $8.99 and up and the kimchi kit uh we make them for $8.25 and we wholesale for $20 so tell us about your sales our Topline sales for last year was $815,000 wow nice good job and what will sales be this year year this year we are projecting a million dollar and how much will you make 25% good for you and is the majority of your sales right now coming through Whole Foods or is a direct a consumer we do almost zero online sales we have our own website but that's that's not our Focus but we also uh partner with William Sonoma have you been in there a long time probably about 8 years now so why ar your sales higher uh I built this company for $50 and a skateboard so building it up I have Z Z outside investors I've done everything myself let me re ask the question because you've got the distribution so what's holding you back from being a 2 three 5 million dollar company because I always thought the way that businesses work is you you you make money in the business and then you can hire more people instead of getting any are making money I'm assuming you pay yourself or is that part of the 250 so uh I don't pay myself I've invested the money back into the business got it first of all you started this with $50 in a skateboard I'm a mom I have sons how does this make you feel mama oh to see your son build something like this I am proud of him but more than anything I'm thankful that he is an honest hardworking entrepreneur who is passionate about kimchi he singlehandedly run the kimchi business now two years ago he met Amy and got married they expecting their first baby next month and Amy had lots of experience in Food business she K her well-paying job and joined our company so now we are a dream team at the cusp of fantastic growth so with your backing the sky is the limit a that's really beautiful honestly beautiful you can't bring mom like that's that's unfair you have a million in sales you know I look at it and say to myself you have to educate people about what this is and I think over time as people become much more concerned about healthy foods this is going to fit in that category the hardest job of this is actually getting people to try it it's not for me guys I'm sorry I'm out he guys one of the hardest things an entrepreneur has to do is determine when to add their first employee because you have to give up a little bit of control when you try to go for growth like that but after eight or nine years there had to have been an opportunity for you to do this I just don't think you're going to be confident and I think it's going to be hard for an investor to work with you so for those Reasons I'm as much as I love you both and as much as I love kimchi and I think it's really spot on for the future it's just not investable for me and I'm sorry I'm out thank you your story was so inspiring and Mama oh you are one of a kind truly but if I'm going to invest in something I got to be able to like really stand behind it and sell it and I'm not a kimch shei person for that reason I just can't invest that amount Damon you're the last shark uh tough one because I I you've sold a good amount over the years but why do you feel that you're ready to change the way you've been operating with your family mhm why is this the time we're we're expecting a baby next month so that's another mouth to feed uh shs please if I may say something Mama kimchi company needs money for capital investment and and expanding our facility why but not only money but your expertise your direction your guidance your support I would like to have someone to come in and teach us and then lead us to the big Market that's why we are here well I'm want the offense and I think it's really because of mama she she's definitely just amazing I'm I'm going to have to trust uh I think my gut I'm not obsessed with the product I'm just obsessed with the culture you and Mama o and I I hope I don't regret it no you know what I hope I do regret it but unfortunately I'm out good luck guys thank you for this uh opportunity to swim with the sharks good luck congrats do I think the sharks made a mistake today absolutely well the important thing is that we stay healthy and love each other that's the most important thing ", "Pumpkin Glove Scraper": "first in the tank is a way to have holiday fun without the stress and mess [Music] hi my name is Daryl Braithwaite aka Big D I'm from the

you must have some huge sales I've got some fantastic sales we just started actually our business we finally just got our shipment of product the end of 2021 the last week of September the first week of October wow just in the next time but the problem is is we're hoping to get it a lot sooner but from the end of September to December 31st we sold 58 000 in sales 3600 take a deep breath Big D thank you you're so excited and passionate about this I just love it so 58k in 2021. okay 21 58k in 2021 2022 this year we've done fifty two thousand dollars from January until now and 6400 units okay so there's not much growth there is there well it's because it's not Halloween yet I'm impressed that you're selling it not in the Halloween time period so explain that to me we went to our first trade show in Las Vegas and everybody kept coming up you guys are the hit of the show big buying group came over twist and said when you come in two weeks to DC to our big buyer presentation we'll guarantee you to be in front of 60 stores to pitch and I sold over 90 of all those stores they're like Daryl this is amazing you're incredible you're a genius nobody who is a genius dumps that stuff on their head hey you never know what you're getting with Big D Amen to that that's why you have sales now for this fall season so what does once kit cost one kit cost if you buy it in the retail store is 9.99 online we sell from 12.99 to 15.99 and what did it cost you to make the adult kid combo cost me 1.78 wow how did you come up with this idea this is my family we love Halloween moments and traditions we love going to the pumpkin patch every single year the kids go and they get the biggest pumpkin possible put it in the cart boom we get home and they're all happy excited Dad starts cutting off the top of the pumpkin then they start going in then all the kids are like ew gross my kids are running around the house my wife's freaking out the kids are crying this picture right here this is my son Parker this picture right here is the absolute moment that I had my aha moment it hit me like that's it now is this your full-time job it's not so my background is in medical cells I've been working hard at night and weekends but with medical sales I understood really quickly that I needed when I got married to have a job to really help that helps pay the bills right that helps pay the bills you're asking for three million valuation how do I get my 300 000 pumpkin seeds back there is nothing on the market that competes with this I have a patent that was issued June 15th I actually filed it on Halloween Day in 2017 on Halloween day I've got two more utility patents pending my patent is a broad patent one of my partners is a patent attorney so he's helped me button up Partners yes how many dollars have you raised towards this and how much you spent we had put about 850 000 into this yeah sharks are still in but they are shocked by the huge amount of money Big D has invested in his pumpkin carving accessory pumpkin glove scraper we have put about 850 thousand dollars well let me tell you why I've only put in about twenty thousand dollars I have a partner that's funded the rest of the money how much of the company do you own I own seventy percent so my second partner he's the financial backing he's like do I believe in you let's go when we first started out building our machine so I've got a machine that I built to make this I can make 6 500 of them a day over in China the problem is covet hit and they they made it so that hey the only way we'll do this is if you'll order 300 000 gloves like a horror movie right there so your your thing to your guy was look big money guy I'm gonna sell through these quickly and the minute I sell through them I'll give you your money back correct he put another three hundred thousand dollars I'm gonna pay him back a dollar a unit once we start becoming profitable because wait wait Big D did I hear a dollar a unit whoa because now I know how the money guy's getting his money back well that's only on that 300 000 only if you can sell it you know often in business uh the challenge is money can highlight your weaknesses sure right and that's what I call the power broke you can make the same mistakes with ten thousand dollars and you count what eight hundred thousand dollars right then what puts small business and startups out of business is actually called over funding they borrow too much they buy 300 000 units when they need 1 000 units I think this is a prime example of that I'm out thank you appreciate it you know look I love this product I think it's very very Innovative super cool I am the Halloween Queen we have carving contests at our company at my house I love this I think this is such a great I will be a consumer but your numbers just aren't adding up to me I think you've taken on way too much risk too early and for that reason I'm out thank you that's yours you right you're gonna learn like every startup does about their product but you're so bought in right on inventory if something goes wrong at all you're out of business and so for those Reasons I'm out thank you appreciate it Dee I wish you'd come in here asking for a lot less than 300K because I love the idea you know I could have got behind it but 300K serious though I love you thank you the 300K is too much I'm out thank you ah Big T and then there was one wow listen um I think this is the best solution I have ever seen for a Halloween pumpkin carving product Halloween is my favorite holiday and um don't let them go I think that there are a lot of positives to this but there are some big negatives one is you bought way too much inventory before you had sales that is something that can really hang you and you don't know how fast that'll go or if it's going to take a long time to come in for three hundred thousand dollars for 10 ask 300 000 alone right yeah imagine digging you out of this hole so while I love it and it's great Innovation I am so sorry I am out oh Lord thank you good luck baby I'm sad because I truly believe with the connections the mentorship from the Sharks this thing's ready to just blow up and that's what I was hoping today I didn't get it but I'm going to continue to persevere like I always have when something you get knocked down you get back to back up and you continue to go but I truly believe this was a fantastic opportunity ", "Stakt": "[Music] next up is a reinvention of an everyday workout accessory [Music] [Music] hi sharks I'm Millie and I'm Taylor we're best friends living in New York City and we're here asking for a hundred thousand dollars for 10 equity in our company sharks over the past few years our lives have changed in so many ways from the way we work to the way we work out our living rooms have become our local gyms our bedrooms have turned into boot camps or mat based workouts are no longer just a yoga class to wind down whirling sculpts Pilates and strength training and our yoga mats they're just not supportive enough and they add no extra value our exercising has evolved but our yoga mats haven't well roll over yoga it's time for an upgrade introducing stocks a map with a unique foldable design that unlocks a new level of Versatility for any exercise when the Stacked mat is fully unfolded it acts just like a standard yoga mat except it's better because it always lays flat and it's twice as thick if you're in need of some extra support we got you hold your stacked bat once or twice and get that much needed extra cushion for your joints or fold stacked up entirely and it transforms into a block that can be used for tricep dips incline exercises such as planks or push-ups lunges and so much more sharks stacked was born out of the love for sweating and the need for adaptation so which of you wants to give us stacks of money and help us take over the fitness industry with staffed good job so you each have a stack bat in front of you it also comes with the carrying strap so you can easily take it with you on the go now I'm in the gym all the time perfectly every day I've seen is that where you keep your snacks match lots of foldable masks what is unique about this so when we think about the foldable matte space there's sort of two kind of mats out there right so there's the big gymnastic mats that are essentially pieces of cushion that are held together by vinyl and those mats are heavy they're expensive they're also not the right material for yoga or sculpt you know they're not grippy they're not Nimble you can't take them out what about the classic rolled mat which you see so many people carrying you know of course yeah kind of why we created this so to give you some background Taylor and I met about 10 years ago in college and we've been best friends we've been roommates and we've always been into fitness but it wasn't really until the pandemic when we started working out a lot more for our mental health and our well-being and we realized we were using a yoga mat but neither of us were necessarily doing yoga and half the time we were rolling up our mats for extra support or we were using a block or something to really enhance the workouts we were doing and so we found that there was you know room in the market for not only a more supportive mat but also a mat to add that versatility and what's great about this is it folds and it can really act as a second piece of equipment and really enhance and modify the workout I'm curious to know the price like what it costs you and then what you sell it for the mat itself in a box with the strap cost us 14.90 it lands to us at 21.50 and we sell it for 86 dollars 86 yes good everything is d2c through our website um and everything's been through creating content and really building a community let's let's say it has Merit all right for sure show us sales so in the six and a half months we've been selling we've done a little over a hundred and ten thousand dollars in sales that's not bad okay we haven't put any money into marketing so better yeah I'm signing up for Pilates now all right and I don't have a map and I go online what are the price points I'm going to be presenting let me take you through it so the yoga mat industry is segmented by materials this is an EVA foam it's non-toxic it's non-porous we compete in the premium segment right we're competing with mats that cost anywhere from seventy dollars to a hundred and thirty dollars we're at eighty six dollars right on the low to mid end of that there are mats 30 35 that are made from something called PVC it's a toxic material and it's something we really haven't been highlighting this mat doubles as a piece of equipment right that's what this was your visuals are really good for that yeah okay and and how much of your own money is into this business we each put in a bit over 25 000 from our savings okay is this your full-time gig so right now we both have full-time jobs just to fund the business so my background's in sales and I've worked at startups for my entire career so I've really experienced first what kind of startups all over the place restaurants um dentists and doctors and most recently with experiential retail all right and uh Taylor so my background professionally I have worked in product for the last six years on the fintech side yeah what kind of product uh it's a portfolio risk and analytics solution for fixed income debt Financial Services I do in fintech yeah so Millie Taylor um I see the viability here but I really just don't know much about this market and listen there could be a million other kind of mats out there I made my career over t-shirts there's millions and millions of seizures but I think there probably will be more sharks up here that would be of more value to you but I wish you luck I like it but unfortunately I don't think I can help you I'm out thank you thank you for this opportunity so I invested in a company called Bala they create an entire Community around high-end fitness equipment but my concern is competing with bala I would be working against myself so for those Reasons I'm out thank you yeah yeah you know look I love yoga I think this is a great idea I love the idea for your knees unfortunately for me I have a mat and I've used the same mat for two years I don't see this as a product that I'm going to continue to re-buy so you're always going to have to be acquiring new customers I really don't see the longevity of this being something that would work for me to be involved so for that reason I'm out all right what are you doing Lori what are you doing Kevin it's a very difficult deal the best part of this deal are you two thank you thank you but I'm sorry this is not a business for me I'm out listen I like this mat a lot I think this is the best mat I've ever seen and I've gone through a lot of them this one's fantastic I'm going to make you an offer no thank you because you guys are so so newbie I'm going to give you a hundred thousand but I'd like 15 but I would like one dollar back per unit sold until I recoup my hundred thousand we will blow this up I'm worth it [Music] we appreciate your offer I guess while we're here be sure to the whole panel just want to see if the conversation guys and then we'll see a little clock in my head going Tick Tock okay Lori do you mind if Millie and I take a minute take a minute maybe 10 seconds okay [Music] okay Lori yes thank you so much for your offer our concern with the royalty is that it's really going to siphon the growth that we need right now to kind of hit with this momentum would you be willing to do a hundred thousand dollars for twenty percent oh see the reason why I did that you guys have a lot of margin so really a dollar when you're making like fifty dollars a piece or more those are really it doesn't really hurt but if you really want me in it to win it how about 25 equity which I'm not going to see unless we sell this company or unless we make a lot of sales 400 000 valuation guys yeah thank you [Music] what'd you do 150 000 for 22 and a half percent no I mean my plan is to blow out so many of these we won't turn it around we won't need it um cheap valuation so you have to decide she's removed the royalty yeah now you could go back to it you know and that was at 15 percent yes 15 yes I could do a 35 royalty 75 cents and you got it you have a deal all right I like it thank you guys thank you guys so much Lori's gonna be a great partner can't wait to work together [Music] this means everything to us we are so excited to take stock to the next level there is a royalty component to the deal but it's okay Lori is so worth it ", "Storage Scholars": "first in the tank is a product created for students by students [Music] [Applause] hi sharks my name is Matt gronberg and I'm Sam chasing we're here today seeking 250 000 for five percent of our company storage Scholars oh guys so think back to your first year of college it's the last week of school you're saying goodbye to all the new friends you just met and you're up late studying when you get the text message from Mom hey good luck on your last exam tomorrow sweetie are you all set to move out the Panic sets in you don't have a car to buy boxes you haven't reserved that storage unit and you don't even remember how that sectional couch got into your dorm room well that is where we come in you can simply go online and create an account you can add your parent to overlook your order information you can pay a 50 fully refundable deposit and we'll handle your entire move out for you students are given boxes 10 a bubble wrap and labels on campus if we prefer final exams they pack up their belongings lock up their room and go home we have a partnership with their University to unlock that room once the campus is empty and will move everything into storage for the summer we'll even have all their belongings ready and waiting in their new room when they return to campus the following semester so Sam who does all this moving that's the best the best part all the moving is done by trained fellow students creating high paying jobs on campus so sharks has two 18 year olds terrified at the thought of student debt we build storage scholars in college which allowed each of us to graduate debt free who's ready to join us on our mission to empower students across America to do the same wow all right how many colleges you guys signed up run 23 college campuses where are you currently so we're at a variety of colleges ranging all the way from New York down to Texas it started at our alma mater Wake Forest University we kind of grew in the Carolinas and then kind of spread our footprint how much is the total move it averages out to 559 dollars for the whole service so that's boxes tape and packing supplies delivered on campus that's the pickup the storage for the four months the delivery and 100 of insurance complimentary on everyone I'm assuming you're going to pay the college to get into their service so our strategy as a business is we want to partner with colleges to get like their full endorsement and create this total like key access pack it lock it leave it experience so we'll day 59 that's my Revenue where are my costs so our costs are about 199 and that includes all of the boxes tape and packing supplies the labor the warehousing everything we're the only people that I know of doing the full key access system which they pack it like nobody else doing key access not with the students and with the technology um and we have our own custom built technology which is what allows us to have the 4.8 star ratings that we do what's the custom technology it's a web app it was actually built by his brother who's a full stack developer over the last six years but essentially it just does so much of the automating for our process to be able to do 3 300 moves across 23 campuses and nine states at the exact same week of the year and nail it every time right so they're impressive tell us about your background and why did you come up with this so I grew up in a family of two High School teachers and education was highly valued but when I decided on Wake Forest University seventy thousand dollars a year wow I was looking at over a hundred thousand dollars in student loans and I always knew that when I got to college starting a business would be my path to Financial Freedom so when I got to college I noticed there was a gap in the market I also had a bunch of friends that were looking to make money and I kind of combined the two needs together we went door-to-door getting made fun of every single day but by the end of that year we service 64 customers had eighteen thousand dollars in revenue and that's how storage I just want to hear so you went in with this huge hundred thousand dollar plus debt you're going to graduate with you started a business while you were at school yes sir and paid off all that debt absolutely yeah wow and I came in a year later I had a very similar story I was trying to pay for both my undergrad and then I eventually had Big Dreams of going to medical school so he said why don't you come work for this business opportunity that I have so I ended up working a lot I worked 106 hours in seven days unloading trucks until four in the morning just dying to prove my worth to this business and I was at the right place at the right time are you guys Partners now are you 50 50. 70 30 breakdown right now yeah okay and did you ever take in any money from anybody else no zero dollars how old are you guys now I'm 24 he's 23. yeah and this is what you do full time 100 good for you guys good for you thank you so what are your sales to date so this year we've done 1.826 million dollars oh my God so your biggest school what's the most number of storages that you have at your biggest school yeah so we're doing about 700 students summer storage at Wake Forest University I'll Wake Forest that's your home school right yes everybody knows you what about a new school that you added outside the Carolinas like in Texas yeah I mean SMU we did 269 customers so how do you grow that so a lot of it is through the partnership with the university and they're going to help email on our behalf get on the University website which drives SEO um you got to get the university yeah listen I'll I'll I'll make you an offer yeah all right I think look at the end of the day either it's a good business or it isn't um no way for five percent I'll give you the two I'll do the 250 for 20. thank you so much for the offer I appreciate it it's an offer what do you got Robin all right well listen I just want to tell you what I think first of all a great idea I mean necessity the mother of invention right thank you but I think you need to give your valuation an evaluation and it's just it's so out there for me you guys I absolutely love you but I am out thank you thank you I like this foreign 250 for 20 percent really appreciate that so guys I I mean Super impressive great business since you have a great maturity about you in some businesses moving slowly is good what I've learned from you you've got to go faster yeah and so to go faster this is where money helps so you've got two offers sure Kevin offered 250 000 for 20 Damon offered 250 000 for 20 percent I like the 20 but I'll actually give you more money I think your evaluation is inflated but it's a bit of a bet on you I'll give you 500 000 for 20 percent whoa whoa one shark is out Kevin and Damon have each offered 250 000 for 20 of Matt and Sam's College Moving Service storage Scholars but Robert has offered to double the money I'll give you five hundred thousand for twenty percent whoa thank you so much that's incredible you go faster guys I'll swing the deal Robert has 500 000 for 20 Kevin and I will give you 250 a piece for forty percent [Music] Matt I offered you twice what you were asking far better than the other two sharks what do you want to do I mean I think at this point like this is of course been our Dream our entire lives to stand on the stage and I wouldn't want to not hear from every Striker I think that's an absolutely incredible offer I'm just wondering we've heard from everyone but if there's potential Mark what are you gonna do oh there is another shark so I'll make you guys an offer and congrats for getting all these offers thank you I'll make it to 250k yeah but I want 12 percent and the reason I'm asking for a little higher valuation than Robert you still get to keep most of your Equity so you know you diluted minimally but I mean I've got a platform and you know there's schools that I have connections to yeah and if I get out there starting to talk about it maybe they won't all be partner schools but you're good the phone's going to ring for you to open up new schools absolutely right and so that's the value that I can bring yeah and I I know thank you so much for that offer I know college debt is a big thing to you yeah you're very outspoken about it yeah for sure I think that's that's really good because we have four offers what do you want to do yeah so first of all guys this is incredible this is a dream come true to get all these offers be here with you all um we do have one counter we're interested in all the sharks right now but we have one County right here would you be willing to do 350 for eight percent no I'll do 10 percent but you guys are going to have to get give up something because I'm going to give you something you can't get elsewhere would you would you come up to 300 for ton do a three million valuation 250 for 10 don't worry about the valuation because it's still the same dilution and that 50 000 is not going to change any more money why would you do that why would you run faster because it's not just about the money well that's true Mark yeah done appreciate it let's go baby let's go yes sir let's go next we'll get this done appreciate it thanks thank you congratulations [Music] oh no oh Mark give us the deal that we were looking for and we're just over the moon we can't reach us right now we came in wanting him he's super passionate about our mission of eliminating college debt he's going to give people the opportunity to be able to do this create jobs on college campuses and I know that he's gonna be the right partner to put some wind behind us we're really excited what was your deal 250k for 10 you cut their value in half sometimes when we negotiate a really good deal for us we the pressure's on us to deliver now yeah yeah of course ", "Woosh": "next up is a better version of an often neglected household [Music] item hi sharks my name is Winston Mock and I'm the founder of wosh I'm seeking 500,000 for 10% in my company sharks when was the last time you changed your home's air filter if you're like most people it's been a while since you thought about your filter and there's a good chance it looks like this isn't that absolutely disgusting as filters get dirty they stop working and what this doesn't catch you and your loved ones are breathing in this includes pollen pet dander mold smoke bacteria and E even Co and that's why I created whoosh a better air filter that's smart enough to know when it needs to be [Music] changed let me show you how it works the smart air filter is made of two parts a filter and a reusable frame the filter is made from the highest quality materials and is placed inside the frame the filter connects to Wi-Fi and has integrated sensors that track the performance of your filter so when it's time to change we send a notification and a filter replacement in the mail with whoosh it's easier to use smart and produces less waste than traditional cardboard filters so sharks who's with me to whoosh for smarter cleaner air there's no intelligence to this no there's there's smarts in it there's electronics built in we have integrated sensors that connect to Wi-Fi it actually checks the see it looks at the air flow and we actually measure the performance of your filter actually so we can see when it's time to be changed so you've designed a better mouse trap yes and what made you come up with this idea why a filter so it was the wildfires in California that in 2019 uh my partner she came to me and said oh you know we got to be worried like should we get a purifier should we get some stuff and I said oh yeah for sure I'm kind of frugal so I really wanted to make one so I went on YouTube and learned how to make one from a box fan and a filter and when I got the when I ordered the filter it was 25 bucks to ship and it's a high quality filter but I was sitting there going man you know why is this so expensive so half of that cost is actually shipping so I thought to myself wouldn't it be cool if like I could change this and ship it for a lot less so are you a tech guy a software Guy what's your background pre pre this I grew up in Canada and so go Canada I took the opportunity to move to the US I joined Google as a product manager have you left Google go I have left Google wow are you doing this full time I've been doing this full time for over a year now let's go in a different direction for a second $500,000 for 10% imputes a 5 million valuation yes I think the product has Merit please tell me you have sales so we are pre-revenue but let me let me come let me see if I can save myself here we raised 62,000 2 months ago and what's most important is last month we signed our our first partnership with Emerson the Sensi thermostat this is a Fortune 200 130y Old HVAC giant huge and they're huge and so I'll tell you what they partn how does it work partnership is they want to bundle our product with their smart thermostat oh now that's interesting what's your unique selling proposition on this you ultimately know exactly when you need to change your air filter what's really important is we have an add-on for the growing number of homes that are moving towards smart thermostats we have an integration that transforms your entire your home's HVAC or the heating and cooling unit into to a Smart air purifier how does it do that what we do is we have a air quality monitor that's paired with our filter it sends a signal to your smart thermostat to say hey air quality is poor and what happens is the monitor goes red it then sends a signal to your smart thermostat and says circulate the air CL what what do you sell this to somebody online for right now if they wanted to buy it right now we sell the this Frame and the filter for $99 what is the filter is $20 and then what does it cost you to make the $20 filter our cost we have a 33% margin and it's shipped so it shows up at your door I'm going to guess that there's some very large filter players that already dominate this Market cuz it's industrial Market has been around for decades right now what stops them from just doing the same thing to the existing multibillion Dollar business they have and crushing you like the filter roach you are I know I must look like filter but I'll tell you something this is this is a great question do you have patents we have patents they're patent pending the biggest filter manufacturers I would say have reached out they've deemed us non-competitive and they are now willing to give us their brand Technology and Manufacturing to make our filters so is that a licensing deal you're going to do with them and this is this is licensing licensing licing you come to the right place grasshopper will learn from roach to grasshopper Lord listen Winston I've heard enough I'm going to make you an offer you're my favorite filter roach there's no question about it I'll give you the $500,000 I want 125% but wait there's more I want 50 cents royalty on every filter when does the worldt end never oh well when maybe when you and I are both dead but wait there's more maybe not but wait there's more there's the I thank you for the offer I think what's really important is right now we're we're a startup we're growing and I um so Winston there isn't enough in the value proposition for me and I'll tell you why tell me why it's really easy to change a filter people aren't doing it I'm not sure this is going to compel them to do it let me see if I can rope you in with the well I I think you've got an offer here from Mr Ali so I'm not your guy for this one wish you all the best whoo away I'm out that's it I uh I don't really believe that I can add any value to you um cuz I think you're up on a good start with a good product so I'm out all right Winston I think you're amazing and Incredibly brilliant unfortunately I haven't heard enough for me to gauge what's going to happen with your patents but because I have some doubts I'm not going to invest I'm sorry I'm out I like the product I like you I like the goal I like the mission right the problem is this is hard to sell you're going to have to spend a boatload of money on marketing even if you partner with the big companies even if they use all Outlets it's still going to be a hard sale and so for those reasons am out K let me ask you something with all of us out for various reasons where are you finding the value in this Winston is a dual patent guy with sneakers on here that's all you need to know that's basically it you have a really tough negotiation ahead with these behemoths you remind me of Benji lock we had to get two lock companies competing with each other my team worked on it for over a year it was tremendous amount of work now unfortunately I'm not doing it for 12 and A2 I want 15% I feel a little insulted that you just let me sit there listening to all these sharks squawking and I want 50 cents in perpetuity on each filter there is Kevin with another Blood sucking offer the perpetuity is obviously a challenge I love that word that's eating cash flow it's a big risk either I'm going to make a lot of money or I'm going to lose 500,000 Winston this is your moment I made you an offer what do you want to do is there no I swear to you if you don't take this deal I won't even remember what whoosh is 50 cents on every filter for perpetuity you don't have to do it Winston you know to you know it if Mark if you believe all you want believe Mark I believe that's the fastest way to go out of business it's not going to go out of business because Mr Wonderful is helping the business grow exactly the perpetuity just locks me out and I think in the long term you're exactly right you know what's going to happen in 36 months we're going to be sitting together just like we were you can make a counter can we can we work with the equity so you have a stick in the company it's so binary it's such a small piece of the company my counter would be I'll bring up the word perpetuity again instead of perpetuity lock me in for the royalty for 3 years what happens if it takes us 3 years to negotiate a deal you're getting it for that entire time where we're going to exit have sales Winston we've got you and the sneakers and the two patents the Behemoth player is going to buy me out they're not going to let me keep the 50 cents it's the only deal I'm going to do it's time for you to make a decision I'll do the royalty but I'd be taking a a down Route on the equity can you hold me at my ask for the equity I'll sign up with you on the royalty for perpetuity so what's your proposal with the perpetuity the the 500k 10% and you get if I stay 10% on the equity yes you'll do the 50 c per two yes done yes wow great deal can't with you fantastic thank you much let's have some fun congrats wed good luck you guys dream good luck wow what a day I feel amazing and I'm so happy Mr Wonderful called me the filter roach but now I'm the filter grasshopper and now I'm going to learn from the master e ", "Bridal Babes": "[Music] next up is a company who wants to make everyone in the wedding party feel as pretty as the [Music] bride hi I'm Ashley and I'm Charles we're from Washington DC and we're seeking $250,000 for 10% equity and our company Bridal Babs the first Bridal Fashion Company for Multicultural women and women with curvs we are changing the bridal fashion game with curb hugging and attractive bridesma dresses yes they do exist and I'm wearing one today when we were getting married I remember Ashley mentioning how difficult it was to find the perfect dresses for bridesmaids my bridesmaid dress shopping experience at traditional bridal shops was horrible I ended up searching the internet high and low and finally found something that would work and when my girls put it on they instantly fell in love and the wedding went viral because no one ever seen bridesmaids and such stunning looks before that's when we knew that we were on to something we went from high school sweethearts to Newly Weds and business partners overnight Bridal babes offers gowns and inclusive sizing which we pride ourselves on and a wide range of Shades that really pop on all skin tones brides and bridesmaides can also shop from the comfort of their home through our live virtual consultations and our thriving social media community so sharks now that you know a little bit about Bridle babes who's ready to get hit so good job great job beautiful what do they they're beautiful first of all absolutely what do they cost give us an average we have two collections our classic collection averages $13.31 and we price them at $445 wow that's amazingly affordable sorry how much you you sell Ashley's dress well not that's Deluxe collection how much would Ash's dress be $67 landed and we'll sell it for about $228 on hang on that dress is $200 isn't that really expensive for a bridal dress no so it's actually not but we do offer an affordable line as well as a more high-end line and our goal really is to provide as much diversity in the product type because we want to service an audience that has been overlooked for years I mean guys you are speaking my language 100% And entirely like the whole inclusive thing this is a huge gap in the market I really just want to understand for you guys like what is inclusive like what are you actually selling what size is um inclusive sizing is sizes 2 through 26 which are actually ready to ship we also have a special order collection in sizes 26 to 32 the greatest challenge for every businesses that Services weddings is customer acquisition how are you getting your customer so our core platform we're on is Instagram our Instagram Community is about 90,000 followers and we have about 60,000 on Tik Tok which has just grown tremendously we are a community we talk to our customers WE Post three to four times a day but the secret sauce to getting those customers is the fabric you all have in so is it this one this is what actually changed our entire business model so when we put these dresses out they went viral because people were like oh my gosh this looks like satin but I see these curvy women in it typically Cur cannot wear satin help me understand I mean Emma and Lori right away went ooh this is great and I'm sitting her going why is this great the key is really the stretch in the fabric it's so stretchy your Cur dance it drapes your curves but this also really helps you with returns right yes you got a fabric like this with this crazy amount of stretch in it you're not getting the same returns as with a rigid fabric tell us about sales we had lifetime sales of $2 million and million wow yes 2 million but I also want to talk to you about our growth so year to date we're at $850,000 in year one which year $3,000 what year was that 2019 in year two we were at $200,000 so it was a nice jump but we were almost five times that in year three with 950,000 now we're a little shrock gold of 1 million we're projected to be there this year 1.2 million wow that's major guys are you profitable last year we made $20,000 are you paying yourselves a salary 60,000 each or total each all right that's fine how much you guys spending on Advertising so we spent about 30% of our revenue on advertising and that's super important because each customer we bring in is not just one customer if we can bring in a bride that's eight Brides MS I know this business incredibly well I make inclusive sizing both skims and good ameran and it makes the margin profile really tricky so talk to me about margins on both of the ranges please so we're at 70% for both of the ranges for your director consumer sales yeah we only sell direct can you please tell me both of your backgrounds I was in marketing for a little over a decade before coming full-time I work for huge cpg Brands like Neutrogena The Laughing Cow I was actually doing some of like the first Facebook ads back in 2009 so that's why I'm kind of like the digital person gotcha thank you and you yes uh I played football most of my life afterwards I became a child psychiatric specialist at Children's Hospital and then I moved into law enforcement and became a detective wow are you still a detective or you just full time I actually I left the police force to completely follow this dream so guys what's the vision what do you want to do with this brand the biggest thing for us is showcasing diversity in a space that never saw Brides couples or even bridesmaids of color in media campaigns so it's so important to us to have that component and making sure that we are celebrating all body types and how big do you want to take the business well Charles has a huge Vision we want to be a $500 million company wow the real question I have is what do you need for you to get to 500 million what are those first steps you need to take and where do you need help so we want to get more team members to create supply chain efficiency because we want to be able to get customers what they need when they need as fast as we can how many people do you have working for you it's just the two of us full-time Charles has one contractor that he works with seasonally so when you guys get orders you just grind it out in the warehouse that you have so who's actually making the dresses so we have a number of Manufacturers overseas what's your lead time on a dress or dresses it takes about two to 3 weeks to actually produce the dresses um but then shipping I'm sure you all know kind of a nightmare um so because we've been selling out so quickly we've had to incur additional cost to do air shipping well first of all super impressive I love the business but I I can't add value in the bridal dress business it's just not my forte thank you for coming but I'm out thank you thank you guys I I'm I'm very impressed I'm in this space I don't know if you know your customer acquisition costs yet it's one of the highest in the fashion business is capturing the bride when she's making her purchase decision I wish you the best but it's it's not for me I'm out thank you guys listen I love the fact that you've managed to stay out of the Trap of this kind of traditional wedding business because it's my belief that any brand that's going to scale and do really well now has to be rooted in some kind of community it's the only way that we can keep advertising cost down and keep that word of mouth going and keep the customers excited there's so much promise in this business so I definitely would love to give you guys an offer I think that your valuation is a little steep so you came in asking for 250 for 10% and I will happily give you guys 250 but I want 25% of the [Music] business oh your valuation just got crushed okay thank you um would you do um oh sorry how about 175 make it 20% and you got yourself a deal we got a deal wow I love it so amazing well done guys amazing you look beautiful congrats guys well done well good one they're on to something they're on to an absolute winner that's told canot believe it we did it you did congratulations I love you don't question ", "Plufl": "let's go energetic

is it it's $3.99 currently taking pr- at $3.99 399 yeah $399 oh okay what does it cost you to make ourl cost is $140 oh wow and you must have sales yes we do 3 months ago we launched on Kickstarter our initial goal was $25,000 we blew it out of the water we hit $280,000 in 30 days and we've done over $130,000 in sales since and how much of that have you delivered we've just started the manufacturing process with being none so throughout our prototyping process we've tested our versions with about 50 different beta testers and they all absolutely loved it I'm curious did you used to lay in like a really big oversized dog bed or something yeah so throughout my time at school I worked as a barista at a local College coffee shop where there lived a great Dan and so one day during a a long shift I was looking at this dog napping really comfortably in its bed and I found myself kind of jealous like man why can't that be me right now and then I had an idea dog beds for humans T I was all over Google trying to see if a product like this existed but I found nothing so I was calling up Yuki a good friend telling him about the concept and he loved it so we partnered with a local designer in Vancouver to build our first prototype and it turned out so awesome that we had people lined up all over our campus just to try it out I I just don't get it like why are people buying these like what who's your customer why not you need I like it I like it I don't get it kid oh come on your kids my 8-year-old would probably love it but like do I want a dog bed in my living room so yes we started out just creating a fun product that would bring joy and comfort to people's lives but we realized we had we're building something bigger than than that when we put it on Tik Tok and went viral and we started getting flooded with messages from people sharing just how excited they were for this product we spoke to with mothers of children with sensory issues veterans with physical trauma people that suffer from a range of sleep issues that just need more comfortable places to you never delivered these it's only been 3 months since we graduated when do you anticipate being able to deliver because you've got no real customers at the moment which means you've got no real reviews like that to me is just a big red flag yeah we expect to deliver around late November to early December and and when did you take the orders we took orders back starting from uh April I mean that's some pre-order period we're talking what 7 months that's right yeah mhm why is it taking you so long to get them delivered that's a long time for just 12200 units ex well but you have to have your production time right I mean I don't know how long it takes to make one of these manufacturer yeah so the 1,00 units takes about 2 months to make and 2 months to ship out so we're looking way to way to reduce our lead time but this is our first go at it okay guys look I think it's a crazy idea

four percent sharks welcome to business casual 101. let's begin so you know this look we're wearing a dress shirt under a sweater it's pretty much the go-to look for every single guy that works in an office around the world I lived in New York for 12 years this is what's called the Midtown uniform problem is I hated wearing a long sleeve dress shirt under a sweater it was always hot and uncomfortable and Scratchy I don't even have to spend the time buttoning up my shirt in the morning and then sometimes you would also get what's called floppy collar where the collar just flops down halfway through the day but worst of all was putting it on a dress shirt under a sweater it is so annoying the sleeves always get bunched up my sleeve's like right up there by my elbow sharks I knew there had to be a better way which is why I invented the dress collar Polo it's a stretchy comfortable golf shirt except the top has a firm collar on it so it gives you that exact same look of a dress shirt but it's really just a comfortable Polo sharks guys are wearing this with a tie under a blazer with a sweater and even for just a slightly more elevated casual look with a polo sharks we are helping guys look stylish and stay comfortable and we've created a new category of shirt help me create the next great worldwide brand", "SquareOne": "[Music] next into the tank is a better design of a party staple [Music] what's up sharks I'm Tim Loucks I'm here today seeking 300 000 in exchange for 10 equity in my company so drinks on tap are becoming more popular now than they've ever been before people are absolutely loving the at-home draft experience but the problem is most Kegs and draft systems are big expensive and not portable there's no way I'm going to take this thing on a boat on a golf cart heck you probably can't even fit it in the fridge huh there's no way that's happening kegs had problems until now meet Square One the world's most efficient mini keg ever [Music] square one has the ultimate cool Factor by providing more volume in less space much you bring not just beer but your favorite drink on tap just about anywhere sharks sitting in front of you is your very own square one I filled it with a tasty fabric pour yourself a glass and let's get down to business I like you and I don't even know you so Peter Mark and Damon you guys have beer Mr Wonderful you have a vodka Nitro espresso Martini oh damn and Laura yours is a John Daly so it's an alcoholic vodka version of an Arnold Palmer wait we need to do a toast do that what do you think of that one Mr Wonderful pretty good actually this is really good so this is CO2 in this cartridge so yours is the only one that's actually running on nitrogen so that's a new product release I always thought that giraffe beer there was something fresher about that sure but if you're putting mixed drinks in there what's the value in that sure so the value like in the home space is for instance like when we go out in the boat or we're doing things outdoors we can batch a whole gallon of cocktails that we're gonna take with us like margaritas super simple to bring with us and then anybody can serve themselves you may make this like a little draft pourer of any kind of drink but wine you don't do wine in this you can put wine in this right so we actually have a wine product in the hopper that'll run on Argon with a different wine spout we're not quite there yet but that's kind of our third product tell us how the whole all the pieces fit together so basically square one it's 128 ounces so it holds either two growlers worth of beer eight pints that's the 12 pack almost yup just about a 12 pack basically you would fill it with your beverage of choice whether it's a cocktail or beer and then assemble the tap and then you pressurize it so it runs on sale too good until it's finished tell me how to disassemble it so I can put in another drink sure so basically everything's threaded it's got a pressure release valve on this side so before you do any disassembly you would pull the pressure so right here yep but you want to turn the valve off to the left right you sure you want to be doing that either pull this out pressurized thing on there oh hahaha I was I was trying to help you wow meanwhile while he's blowing himself up too Tim you must have we're gonna get because obviously three million is quite a big valuation you must have good sales so far so we've sold over 4 000 units uh right now lifetime sales are over 1.4 million wow okay over a year yeah what have you made out of that Tim so we lost about a quarter Million last year um no this year we're on track to make a 15 Nat okay this is gonna be our first profitable in the month and we're on track to do over 200 Grand this month in sales damn nice and how much are they uh so that one right there in front of you retails for 259. what does it cost uh it cost us 130. we make them in Washington State uh last may we set up our own manufacturing facility where we started adding and refining our processes so we could get the costs down to where we could be profitable so I'm buying these things as a consumer for my home correct this is not for a business but it could be right but yes so we focused 100 direct consumer on this really the vision was in the commercial Market when covid hit we're like okay we're spending a lot of money developing and creating these products but we got to start bringing some money back through the door and Tim how did you come up with this then what made you think of this sure uh so I've always been an idea guy never really took action on any but uh it was November 2017 I woke up in the middle of the night like and for some crazy reason I was thinking about the inefficiencies of round kegs I'm like everywhere they're stored everywhere they're transported everywhere they're refrigerated our Square rectangular spaces I just thought it would be a huge value okay as all of us being potential Partners how often do you wake up at 2 30 in the morning about thinking about a more efficient way to get hammered never but I guess I was lucky yeah right Tim so it is very very cool but I don't really comprehend the value of it because I'm just I'm not a tap drinker so I'm a little stuck there I just I don't think I I get it as much uh so I'm out thank you so Tim I have an important question because I'm in the wine industry you know there's a lot of Delivery Systems for that actually try and keep wine from spoiling after you've had a little bit of a bottle we put argon or nitrogen gas in it is the one you're making for wine could I put three bottles of Chardonnay in here and then would the system I'm asking if this is a plan you're going to use argon gas to seal that surface from any Oxygen hitting it correct so for the next two weeks I could be pulling out a glass yeah a Chardonnay 100 well that is a cool idea Tim it's cool listen it did pique my interest now I'm a Wine Drinker right what would be really cool is is if you get that one figured out I hope you'll come back in the tank with that sure you don't have it right now so I think you're on to something I wish you good luck thanks Corey Tim I I can't see how I could help you turn this into a great business I think it's a really neat invention but I just can't I can't scale this with you so for that reason I'm out thank you Tim I love the product I really really do obviously I'm clumsy with it I'm not good with mechanics at all I see the value for it I'll definitely try to buy some because I think I think you have a hit I just don't know where I would fit with it so for those reasons amounts thanks Mark you're welcome okay so I'm intrigued okay when is the wine product coming in less than three months why didn't you say that to me I I guess I just didn't say it I I'm really intrigued with the white wine in the fridge and the red wine sitting out on the bar with the Argon or nitrogen gas that's a very cool idea the industries are trying to solve for that for 20 years absolutely [Music] all right I'll give you the 300K I want 20 percent I'll tell you why I mean you need someone like me to help you blow this up online because really you want to sell it direct to Consumers Tim no I think it's great I I honestly I know Mr Wonderful has great senses in this space when it comes to beverage would you consider doing the 300 for 15 meet me in the middle no it it's a simple product I like what you've done I mean other than Mark blowing yourself up but um it's going to be work for me I get behind this we'll make a lot of money together it it looks beautiful it fits in the fridge and I'm going to take a flyer on it I want 20 percent [Music] [Music] I like that deal I like that deal it's a great deal Square Keg's been my life on the side from my day job for five years it's been a complete grind but it's enabled me to leave the corporate handcuffs behind once and for all and now that I'm working with Mr Wonderful super confident we're going to take this thing to the Moon before you go don't forget to subscribe to the Shark Tank Youtube channel and ring the

from West Palm Beach Florida and we're here seeking $300,000 for 5% of our company so sharks we brought some gifts for you and what we've got is way cooler than these outdated gift baskets that my granny sends me out of a mail order catalog and definitely way tastier than overpriced fruit shipped to your door now the dominant players in the online edible gifting space they're going to ship you a basket full of chunks of cheese and chubs of meat that you have to laboriously peel chop up and then artistically present yourself sharks It's Time to Say Goodbye no the boring gift and revolutionize the edible online gifting space where border border is the first company in the world jipping completely pre-assembled catering Quality Cheese and shuie Boards Nationwide our edible works of art are shipped completely pre-arranged all you have to do is remove your board from its perfectly sealed packaging pour the nuts in the spots where you find them and you have a beautiful chef quality display in just minutes so sharks who's ready to make an unbelievable investment we know it's a lot of cheese but we're going to make you a lot of cheddar stop the talking start the eating so sharks you have your shark cutery boards in front of you a I got that oh wow that's really tasty oh wow so we have a small a medium and a large and one thing to understand about these is they're not custom products these are made in an assembly line and we can make up to 3,000 of these in any given day W so we've created a new gifting category this is amazing when was this board made does it tastes Super Fresh it's all Super Fresh our standard is next day so if somebody makes an order by midnight the next day we make it completely fresh and then it ships out that same day and it gets to the customer the very next day where is the facility that you're doing this at we have a 15,000 ft production kitchen in Florida so let's talk about price what does this cost so the one in front of you cost us $91 to produce we wholesale it to our vendors mostly through eilers online for uh $154 and it retails for $229 including shipping how did you guys come up with this so I've been in a hospitality and restaurants my entire life and while I was in culinary school to make money I started a little catering business and over the next 15 years my wife Julie and I built one of the largest high-end catering companies in South Florida for royalty for celebrities for athletes it was like really a dream come true and then the pandemic hit and it literally like stopped it uh so it it stopped everything and so we pivoted and that that's when we bet on e-commerce we hustled for 9 months and we launched with uh a popular online etailer and everything changed we went from one online etailer the first year then we launched with uh William Sonoma and then we launched with uh door Dash last year we did 1.8 million in Sal wow and then wow we launched with Costco in Q3 of this year what sales be this year 4 million this year wow will you make money yes we'll be profitable we'll do 400,000 is what we believe you sell direct if I want to buy it from you we just launched our website in July and how's that working out it's been going really well so far we did $30,000 in sales our first month what is your customer acquisition cost uh between $40 to $60 in our first initial couple weeks of testing and that's really why we're here we want to build that side of it out because our biggest frustration is that we're selling through etailer so we don't own any of our own customer data so we get a huge rush of sales in Q4 and then we can't remarket to those customers q1 through Q3 and we see that there's so much demand for the product Rachel were you working in the catering business is that how you guys met so when the pandemic hit and work went remote my fiance and I decided to move down to Florida to quarantine with my family Aaron had started delivering these boards for local delivery in our area so you were a customer I was a customer yeah and I fell in love with the concept from ordering and Aon and I got to know each other and we would talk talk about this Vision he had I've believed in him since the minute I met him are you Partners 50 we're Partners we own 75% together we outside partner how much has he invested so$ 750,000 $750,000 and he helped us build out the entire production facility now there are five giant competitors that sell baskets and gifted items couldn't they simply do this themselves why why this it's a great question and when we started we were worried about that but what we're doing is so different than pick and packing our facility is built to suit for this type of production that's kind of our secret sauce and that's our secret so how we're able to do 3,000 EES a day how much money did you guys put in my wife and I did a $300,000 home equity line of credit we also put in another $150,000 SBA loan and then another $100,000 line of credit against the catering business and Rachel did you put money in invest I put in 750,000 for the build out of the facility how much have you invested in total around uh 2 million total wow man that's commit we we can do $70 million plus out of this one facility y Rachel I couldn't be more impressed with the two of you thank you but 300,000 for 5% I just don't think the amount of equity we're doing 4 million this year I'm with you 100% And I just don't like to be a small minority shareholder like that I'm going to clear the deck make room for the other you can have as much cheese as you want yeah thank you I'm out so guys I think what you've done is phenomenal right you deserve a ton of credit you're pivot you showed agility curiosity to go into a new space I just think this is replicable to Kevin's Point those big companies they're not stupid they know that it's in their best interest to keep you from building that brand not saying you can't do it I just don't think the economics work for me as an investor so for those Reasons I'm out thank you Mark we understand uh I know the space inside out I am very worried about competition because I I fought them for years they built big businesses and they have really good customer acquisition costs so my offer is going to reflect the risk I see but also I bring to the table a brand called Chef wonderful that's been very successful and I think I could get behind this product for you I'll give you the $300,000 I want 17.5% Equity wow what do you need the money for we think we're going to get do 2 million just in December and we need all the available Capital we can get to put into in and this will help us to be able to run our direct consumer strategy I have an offer I think you're going to need a lot more cash you probably don't even need a partner you probably need a good credit line but I'll give you both I'll give you $300,000 Cash Plus $300,000 credit line but I'd like 15% of the business is that undercutting this guy here y good 15% thank you bar thank you for the off I'm going to make it really simple uh two sharks around out Rachel and Aaron have two offers on the table for their shuder board delivery company border and Lori might be interested I'll give you 300,000 for 13% 13 lucky number 13 you have three offers yes what would you like to do our most important thing to us is launching our direct to Consumer strategy and so whoever has the most expertise in that space that's right here no one's done what I've done direct consumer in consumable gifting nobody you want to sell this one day to Hickory Farms or somebody else that's how this works I know how to get there these two don't well I've sold over 2,000 products over 20 years direct to Consumer I don't think I agree I don't think I agree with what Kevin's saying I've done every product category there is got you got to pick a pick a shark pick an offer counter okay okay you say she's going to say it cuz I am as you can see I'm sensitive and I hate to hurt people's feelings Okay Lori would you do it for 8% oh you guys we've already invested so much in this we've got the whole production process down all we need is someone to pour gasoline on the fire well let me tell you this and Mark says this all the time say it Mark 40% of a water Bell is better than 100% of a great you know so here's the thing if I blow you up and you're making fantastic sales then you're going to be thanking me and saying oh I don't care about those vi points so I'm going to stay at 13 you guys it's time to decide would you do it at 10: you you we don't need a lot I mean I will do it at 12 you know what guys I would do it a 10 wow I would do it a 10 because the best deals we've all ever done are the least needy entrepreneurs where they just call with questions and they just want some support maybe an introduction I'll do it for nine he just did that to get me down he's such a he's such a nine nine you got a deal I get free boards now I get free boards for oh the cheese you're welcome guys cheese for life for life so cool yeah we love Lori we think she's the perfect partner for us she reaches all of our customers and she was really passionate about the product and I think that's what matters most we need somebody who's going to help us spread the cheese and she's the perfect partner Mark you did it for that cuz I knew they weren't going to do 13 I knew there was no way they going do 13 I loved your whole speech how you were staying at 13 and then you went to nine cousin ", "Ride FRSH": "next into the tank is a modern version of a stale car accessory [Music] hey sharks I'm Trey Brown and I'm Don Brown we're two brothers from Los Angeles seeking a 200 000 investment for five percent of our company imagine a peaceful day on the road wind blowing sun shining you're bumping your favorite track cruising down the back streets just catching a Vibe but then that smell hits you a nearby landfill spilled coffee even forgotten french fries can turn your car from an oasis into a horrible stinky nightmare for years the problem of a stinky ride has been solved by a series of ugly and unstylish air fresheners so we created ride fresh the world's finest air freshener brand I know you guys are probably wondering why paper air fresheners when you do a little sniffing around you'll figure out that it's an untapped Market at ridefresh we offer a subscription-based car air freshener brand with unique scents and Designs that'll be sure to blow you and your customers mods we have amazing scents like wood grain wow eucalyptus I love this one bro nice and even your favorite basketball teams this one smells like winning sorry Mark the reality is is that paper air freshers have had no innovation in far too long and they smell whack hey bro what's up I think I'm smelling the deal with the help of the Sharks we can make ride fresh explode a series of all right fresh scents please feel free to crack them open and enjoy wow wow after that Mark are you okay you're kind of still over there oh you know what how much marketing move ever I'm out what that's it seriously seriously you got to read the room wrong move wrong time what are you upset about yeah why what do you think the one air pressure from the NBA is the team that beats Us in the NBA Conference Finals gotta know that cut it out yeah I could be but I'm not wow here's one thing I'll shout out before I even opened them I picked them up and I could smell the scents I was like wow these are obviously packed with the fragrance so we pride ourselves on having some traditional scents some non-traditional scents but our entire approach and our entire brand is adding a cool factor to the air freshener and changing the experience you sell any of this stuff in retailers at all subscription direct to Consumer online so we built our business off of direct to Consumer online we proved the concept to the tune of over 1.1 million dollars in sales and then what thank you thank you how much time in three years let's talk about one year this year what are you going to do in this year in sales this year we're going to do over 750 000 But to answer your original question Mr Wonderful we've always known that the subscription was the first phase of our building our business but the main potential and the biggest potential for us is in retail and wholesale right why would you say that have you proven that or have you just started down that Alleyway well gas stations things like that things where it's intuitive to pick this up exactly so just in the in the last six months we've been able to get to the final stages of an agreement with the largest Automotive retailer in the country what's the deal for uh two thousand dollars two thousand of their six thousand locations in other words they're going to order from you how many dollars of merchandise 2.1 million dollars in 2023. so it's like Pep Boys that kind of thing yeah it's AutoZone right what did you sell last year last year we sold 5440 000 and out of that 540 was any retail it was at all subscriptions why does somebody buy a subscription model right for an air freshener for their car right yeah so it's a convenience factor right think ride share drivers taxi drivers these types of individuals if I started with you how long before I cancel about four months and how long how much subscription uh they range so the base one is you get two a month and we have them in pairs and that's 8.25 with shipping and then the highest one yeah and the highest one is 10.99 so 38 cents is our cost landed out of the 540 000 you did last year were you profitable yes yes what did you make uh 40 000 in profit wow 40 000. what were you guys doing before this yeah so why are you here we're brothers um we're lifelong entrepreneurs um in 2014 we actually launched the first mobile app for black and brown emojis um before they kind of Diversified the set my brother has a successful career in sales and I was at a couple different ad agencies uh in my career we both went to Howard University the Howard University I then came to Los Angeles and then I got my Master's at USC uh in entrepreneurship Innovation and as well as a certified in technology commercialization I remember walking down the street and seeing all these air freshers everywhere in everybody's car and I was like well listen if we put some culture and style on top of this thing I already know that this Market is 11 billion dollars worldwide in the United States is 300 million so yeah we could definitely do this because there's nobody really doing a subscription model that's the most interesting thing you've said in this pitch the air freshener Market is 300 million yeah it's interesting and this is very male skewed I think you need work here in that I think you need to have an entire female based line because I wouldn't hang this shape in my car it's not the right investment for me but I wish you good luck thank you so much you guys are the real deal I've been trying to get my head around investing in you when I was younger my mom and dad put me in the back of a car with a million suitcases and everything had to sit in the back for 24 hours no because my dad refused to pay for a motel so we had to drive from Toronto all the way to Florida all I could see was the air freshener it is scorched into my brain as soon as I see air fresheners I think I never want to go back there I'm sorry I can't be in I'm out there but let me tell you where I'm stuck at the numbers okay no one's brought this up yet I don't know why two hundred thousand dollars for five percent four million valuation on a business that makes no money this is a business model not yet fine-tuned I'm out uh I think you need to be congratulated for producing seven hundred thousand dollars in sales it's amazing online amazing why are pivoting that you're going into retail I think you're out of your mind I don't think you realize cash intensive it is why did you pivot to retail I'm curious because that was all that was always the plan right and in the last year the main way that we were able to grow the subscriptions and acquire those subscribers became a lot more expensive you were losing heart in your subscription model because the numbers had changed yes but we were always going to focus on growing the business through retailer wholesale all right so I'm going to be making an offer contingent on your big deals okay I'll take a flyer on this because I believe in the two of you so I'll make you the offer of course the 200 000 but I do want 25 of business [Applause] smells a lot let me can I ask a question yes um are there other ways that you can help us in terms of a strategic partnership in exchange for maybe 15 for their 200k I would have to say 15 definitely not I think this is going to be a lot of work to sell this thinking about 200k for 20. what for 20 contention on those two big things on those two deals you got it okay thank you thank you guys thank you you better not lose my money thank you so much thank you and sorry again are we I'm sorry it's all good it's all good congrats guys I think Barbara saw true entrepreneurs grit grind tenacity we were already trending upwards with these major retail and wholesale deals the trades been able to secure and having Barbara on board just means that we're going to have more resources and more abilities to scale this business all the way to the top ", "HummViewer": "[Music] we are first in the tank is a unique way to get up close personal with nature hi sharks my name is Joan and I'm John we're from Loveland Colorado we're seeking 75 000 for 10 of our company sharks one of Nature's most magnificent creatures is the hummingbird you ever seen one up close I mean like really up close well if I so fast it's almost impossible to see their beauty but now you can get a real bird's eye view thanks to my invention [Music] [Laughter] [Music] spectacular way to both feed and observe hummingbirds right before your eyes [Laughter] the user is fully protected as a hummingbirds perform a full-on acrobatic show as they swoop Dart hover and even fly backward while feeding the vibrantly flowers attached to the clear mask he has Silly attract any hummingbirds nearby so sharks which one of you want to experience a view and hum along with us on our journey to feed the birds wow so what do you put in here is it like a sugar nectar yeah the sugar water and then how long do you have to sit before they come we recommend until the birds get used to it take down the bird feeder and stand or sit where the feeder was what do you sell these for and what they cost you to make we sell them for 59.95 and they cost ten dollars to make how many have you sold oh we've sold about 500. [Music] decided that we need to get on Twitter and Facebook so I tweeted a picture of my brother wearing the mask um the TV and the News company in Denver one of their photojournalists called and she said we want to do a story on this mask and I wondered what the story was you know this story crazy man in the mountain no it's a crazy man in the mountains so maybe that's it so 15 minutes after they aired it I got an email from a gentleman that said all I said was put me down for a dozen I looked at her and said we might be onto something do you have a patent the people that own the property above our cabin he's a retired patented agent his recommendation was to get a patent application and then we decided that we could make a business out of this I think obviously there's a lot of bird watchers bird lovers the hummingbird Community I'm sure so have you put out videos did you have anybody within that Community try to help you to sell these we did I reached out last fall to a hummingbird influencer on Tick Tock and and um he wore it on his Tick Tock and it's his fourth most highest view he got five point or 5.4 million views on his video okay guys one thing to know I'm sure my fellow sharks do not know this but I study Greek mythology Greek mythology the hummingbird is known as a messenger it brings messages to humans um and it's given me one I'm out well thank you for the message thank you so guys this is a really great business slash hobby where you can talk to your community of people and have a great time and experiences make some money I want you to enjoy yourselves I'm definitely going to use it from time to time but I'm out guys this is not something I would be passionate about I think it's awesome you came up with the idea you know necessity is the mother of invention and you nailed it but it's not investable for me so for those Reasons I'm out listen guys I think Super novel super cute idea I could giving these to bird lovers and just a lot of fun but I do see it as my fellow sharks do as something that is a hobby a fun thing for you I don't think it's something that's going to make millions of dollars it doesn't need to but as an investment for me I don't see it as an investable product so I'm you have one shark left first of all I am very interested I'll tell you why when my dad passed away all of us saw a bird outside of where he and my mom lived and he loved hummingbirds he always talked to us about the hummingbird and they're just extraordinary engineering Feats of Nature and every time that we see hummingbirds we called each other my siblings and I and my mom thinking about my dad so for me this is the shirt this is like fate I actually think it can go into novelty stores you can do well on Amazon I I can see it being a fun thing yes do you have any debt not company debt we took out a home equity loan then in the beginning to help pay for the patent and buy the minimum amount of these that we could get how much of your own money has gone into this business about forty thousand dollars and and what do you need from a shark I've been in the electrical business my whole life I don't know much about the retail and marketing industry so what we need is that somebody to help us set this business up and Market it you have any inventory currently yes we have 1500 left we've got 2 000 to begin with okay um you have 25 000 lifetime of sales I don't even know how to Value these like well that's been a struggle for us too I so the three of you I mean they did put forty thousand dollars in that's a lot of money yeah I was gonna say 50 50 but I will be uh channeling my kindness of Lauren I'll do 35 percent [Music] that's a deal [Music] that was fantastic thanks guys so wonderful thank you thank you hahaha that soul to the Earth people man that's why we do the show you could have taken 90 of his company he was been you got a deal we finally we knew yes the crazy man in the mountains did it about that yeah thank you ", "ShredSkinz": "hey sharks my name is Clay Griffin II I am the CEO and founder of shredskins today I'm seeking sixty thousand dollars for 20 Equity of my company now sharks there are usually two ways to feel instant satisfaction after a great workout one you push yourself to the Limit where you're so sore the next morning it just feels so good and two being covered head to toe in your own sweat but with the current sauna suits on the market today if you don't clean and dry them properly you might irritate your skin really bad Mark you I know exactly I sweat when I think about it right I mean the only other option is using a trash bag shred skins the first and only single use on a suit on the market today at shredskins we use an eco-friendly plastic to conveniently show you your massive sweat progress with our unique design we have elastic around the waist and the wrist and on top of that a drawstring on the hood this allows you to trap heat minimize your time warming up and maximize your time actually working out and it just makes you sweat faster so I hope you make a deal with me quickly oh [Music] but see that may be their favorite part about shred skins but let me show you my favorite part about shred skin Kevin show them how to really do it now sharks I know what you're thinking when you hear single use but we use an octodegradable plastic soon a newly developed resin to help break that plastic down even faster as we strive to be as eco-conscious as possible this way you can feel just as good about using shred skins as you do wearing shred skins during the workout so sharks which one of you wants to shed fast easy sweat and Shred fast easy money with shred skins you guys all have samples in front of you check those out while I put my shirt on great job yeah I feel like your Barbara's not here explain to me yeah right Barbara would be uh she'd be she'd be sweating just sitting there wow all right clay this is this is interesting I uh I don't think I've ever heard of a sauna suit before uh but I definitely do know what it's like to run in a poncho and know that it is not my favorite thing to do uh in general just being having all that moisture and and everything just kind of stuck to you I mean that's why we we wear uh sweat wicking you know stuff when or well I say we me uh where sweat wicking you know shirts uh and pants to get the sweat away from us and and oh God that's kind of disgusting the whole dumping a whole bunch I mean it's it's it's a it's a it's a form of Celebration I get like I I'm you know in the moment that's awesome but like yeah I could see where a lot of people would be like you know that's that's really gross um anyway uh six thousand twenty percent not not a terrible valuation to get you know uh uh three hundred thousand dollars there uh that's hopefully got some sales it seems like he's got a pretty good product that uh if it is that like degradable and will uh it's going to be even sped up even more when they use the different uh resin as uh clay said there but very cool I I I I wouldn't mind trying it even though I'm not the biggest fan of having having all that moisture uh stuck up under me like that we're gonna check out their website's website at the end here meet the target market okay and is it just to lose weight the ironic part is shredskins actually does target women because women carry a ton of water weight but also my biggest Market is athletes and fighters fighters need this one to make weight all the time this isn't something that I created that didn't exist before what didn't exist is the convenience of it so it allows you to again minimize your warm-ups so you can heat up that core temperature in your body and actually get to your workouts and then some people love this way some people love the idea of looking at their sweat while they're working out there's also if you need to be ripped for whatever reason I'm going to be a little bit more doughy if I don't sweat and I'm a lot more ripped if I do so this is all water weight yes exactly so if I need to fit into something I can just put this on and it might fit me better maybe so just to be clear right I never promote this is a a get skinny Fit Fast product ever I love the fact that you're not overselling and that you're overselling that's a great gift for an entrepreneur that has self-confidence that that you said you don't you're not trying to make silly weight loss claims I really love what you said is there enough of an established Market that knows the merits of this or do you have to educate people to wear these I believe that in my market everyone loves this product because it's convenient I blew up on Tick Tock one of my biggest videos is 17 16 million um and we average about a million a week on Tick Tock be a million a week on Tick Tock gets you what sure so when I first started uh October 2020 um I did 15 000 in sales in those two months I was like I'm ready for Shark Tank yes I've ever made in my life put me on ah what shocked me was the next year we did about a hundred and ninety thousand dollars in sales yes sir and here to date now we're a little over 100k and we're projected to do a quarter million this year so how much did you do in Revenue last month um we did about 23 000. and how much did you make out of that oh five thousand that's still not bad how are you running tell us about you tell us about it I like I appreciate that Colleen you know it's under he's he is consistently underselling this and I and I appreciate the fact that he you know kind of was like ah you know maybe like five grand because he obviously clay he's done his homework right he knows that big number uh you know big number small numbers they're you know certain notes are going to be hit with the sharks and in this case uh he felt that he was not there but uh Mark surprise them said it was good and and I and I agree look you're you're you're just getting started um I would love to see how you know how much is he spending in ads and and um and if there's an opportunity for him to kind of step in and sell it to sell it to a market that wouldn't necessarily know of it or buy it otherwise I I definitely be interested in in like I said I'm not the biggest fan of the whole moisture thing but uh I'd be I'm definitely down for trying it on my runs your background I'm an ex-college football player where'd you play I played linebacker and uh for UTEP University of Texas El Paso obviously it didn't work out I broke my arm my senior year but I'm a dad dad first always my wife and my son and I you know you spend the last four years Chasing the Dream I remember I was training for these leagues and I was using a trash bag just like I was saying and I kept feeling embarrassed leaving the house using a trash bag so then I would go and I would get these reusable ones mind you I just got out of college I have no money I keep spending 20 on these reusable suits that would rip on me every time I'm trying to do a pass rush move so it would rip on me and I remember I looked it up and I said single-use sauna suit and it didn't exist and I looked it up everywhere looked it up everywhere and I remember I turned to my wife I said I'm going to start a company called sweat skins and she was like uh no me I've been trying to get my family back in the same house I stayed with a few friends sleeping on the couches doing the entrepreneurial thing they stay with my mother-in-law and just been grinding ever since and it's been a journey but it's been great you're making five grand a month why are you living in a separate house because I still do I do owe debt tell us about that that comes from my partner um he he kept giving us money to keep the inventory demanded how much have you raised well he okay so he gave me 25 000 for Equity he owns 25 he put a loan through the business for a hundred thousand dollars hundred thousand dollars correct why can't you live at home because I can't take a salary I have a job now so I had to get a job too much that's fine that's fine that's fine and it's away from home it's not in the same city yep it's in Boston they're in South Carolina so what are you doing in Boston I work in cyber security Boston is extremely expensive nothing against Boston but I'm leaving there as soon as I can be very Earnest about where you are today with this business and with your life 100 um and honestly full transparency I always told myself I'd never come on the Shark Tank and cry but it's because I've been through worse uh when I was 13 and 14 I lost both of my parents I had to find a way through football to get a scholarship I have a little brother that I had to help take care of um I've been through worse and I have a son I'm a dad so I can't I can't fold like I can't like I have to make him proud because my dad made me proud when he was an entrepreneur I told myself I wasn't gonna cry but like I I have no other choice like I I own I hope debt and I pay it back every month I went and got a job because I didn't want to take from the business everything I put back was into the business I don't like owing anything to anybody I have a son that I want to pass this down to one day I never thought I would create this business it seems silly when you think about it you think of it like a trash bag but they say some of the craziest inventions that you come up with come up with things that you've already done every single day how much inventory do you my man you don't worry about crying that's okay don't and you come and get ready to comment about that stop it um that if it's negative if you know unless it's support of that uh it you know every day we as super entrepreneurs as as as part of the super Community we show up not only for ourselves but for the people around us the people that we care about and Clay absolutely ding ding I can't ding the Bell enough I didn't want to interrupt his his uh story there uh too much but that um is is powerful right and it shows the power of like I'm not gonna make excuses about it I'm not gonna do uh you know just let allow it to beat me down and and and turn the you know turn this into a negative and and I'm gonna make it part of the story because it's part of the journey that we live as as as super entrepreneurs we go out and we get what we what we desire and it doesn't come fast it doesn't come overnight almost ever and most people that are telling you that it does are probably lying to you you know these these Journeys um sometimes you know can take five six ten fifteen years and I know on Shark Tank they like to beat people there well this product's been around for 10 years and it hasn't done what blah blah blah and it's like well yeah but like in that 10 years like we had kids I had cancer blah blah blah this happened that happened like all these things happened and and we have to you know put the the things that are most important to us first right and and if it's you know if you have a family that's the number one thing that you have to put in in front of you first and to make that sacrifice of I'm going away regardless if it's entrepreneurship or uh being in the military or um you know taking a job and and not bringing your your family along like that is a super sacrifice on everybody's part not just you doing the thing right um I mean even right now like I'm in here like I could be could be making cookies and stuff with my family but we're you know they know I'm in here I'm making these videos I'm here with you sharing this experience and sharing the knowledge and sharing the learning and uh and I to me I I think that we have to be willing to make the sacrifices that we we can as long as we set those principles for ourselves to like I'm always going to be there for X Y and Z as much as possible to help make up for the fact that look I can't be there right this second right because I'm I'm here I'm here with you uh I'm here with other other entrepreneurs interviews and conversations and you know even in in our in our uh repair shop business uh part of Fleet Solutions like you know I'm there during the day instead of instead of here and doing things uh within and for the family because we still need to make money right like we're talking dependently wealthy uh like that so um it's and even if we were I would still want to do this I would still want to create things and write books and help others and um so it doesn't you know I think you have to figure out what's real you're really passionate about and clearly in Clay's uh situation he's he's passion not only about his family but in in helping himself solve the problem right the um issues or the mother of all invention right it's like what what are the what's the problem right and how can we we uh fix it and uh in this case clay has has nailed that in and um I feel bad I fall asleep sorry clay I know if you're watching this um I appreciate you I appreciate you sharing your story and I'd love to have you come on the show for an interview we will I will do my darn just to make that uh the schedule work out to fit it in because I've just been so busy lately uh with business stuff and family stuff and holiday stuff and everything uh and this stuff so uh but yeah please reach out in the comments below and we're gonna make that happen I have right now all right about 35 000 worth how much did you pay for the inventory we bought eighty thousand dollars worth our cost is four dollars and Seventeen cents per five pack we sell it for 19.99 what is the minimum size order from the the maker ten thousand um to get it to that cost of 55 cents it's 420 for five in a package right and that includes the packaging is a buck 50. right for me I don't see how there's room for an investor in this brother investors he's ahead of me on the cap table I'm an equity investor he's got the debt he's first I get it I wish you the best but I'm out last year we sold out five times how selling this right now only direct to consumer or in any stores only director of consumer so I think there's tons of Merit to what you've done here sometimes you take the Nugget of the simplest idea and you turn it into something that really can become something great you're so honorable and so good I love you I just don't think that the product is the right fit with me so for that reason I'm out thank you so much Laura I appreciate it Daniel come on Lori come on that's tough say all the nice things say all the right things and then nothing what are you doing I love you man because you're so honest you're so honest and you're so real and you don't give up and you're hanging by a thread and you're just going for it so I would love to give you a hand I will give you the sixty thousand dollars and I'll do my best to give you a hand for you 20 thank you so much wow yeah he just offered you exactly what you came in asking for if you were to send an order to somebody that didn't have the fancy bag right would they still be happy I mean there's a handsome guy on the back of there but um not really but yes they care right correct right so you can add almost 10 more a dollar fifty more per unit you sold 12 000 units right that's 18 000 in your pocket right if you don't use these so now all of a sudden you're making money so I'll do the deal I can help you just with basic guidance right so I'll give you the the 60 grand for the 20 wow what are you looking looking for what do you need manufacturing and inventory for sure well you do have two offers Damon what are you doing I think you need to consider the offers on the table yeah for sure foreign you know it makes me wonder um Damon you know I don't know four three four five years ago um he was all about the the CrossFit Gyms and stuff like that I feel like this would be like a perfect fit for that but I I I don't know if he's still involved uh like that with the with the CrossFit Gyms I want to say I I I love the way you feel about me I I appreciate that passion and that um really made me tear up and I appreciate that I'm glad that you see that to me and I'm glad all of you see that on me because I'm very hard on myself because I have to be that rock for my son I can't let him see the struggles that I do go through um but with that being said uh Mark you got yourself a deal let's go yes sir thank you so much thank you guys I appreciate you thank you good luck Colleen thank you so much well I hope clean this up don't worry about that don't worry don't worry about that all right hard working man I've seen an entrepreneur pick up his own trash I know oh man let's go though I love Daniel and I loved his offer and I appreciate him uh I felt like Mark was more up my alley and I feel like I can expand more with having someone like Mark Cuban on board yeah I mean it yeah I mean Daniel's great and all but uh I don't think that he's going to be able to offer up you know the instant cred that Mark is uh so I would love to have you come on the show again just uh drop a comment down below check out those check out the website got Shark Tank spray then you got faces you got people wearing it right there on the home page and we can drop an email address on the side there love it love it love it love it um the the benefits are right there I feel like the benefits though might you might be better off putting some of those I mean these fast easy sweat I guess I guess that's good but I don't know I feel like these these could be closer to towards the top um just to for you know if you're trying to convince people who wouldn't necessarily use it uh to use it I think it could be a great great tool there and uh it's great seeing the the sweatshirts but I mean realistically we really are trying to oh we got an auto playing video here with sound um you know I think that that's the sweatshirt's cool but like you're really here to sell this right uh I think anybody that that's gotten this would maybe want to get one of those hoodies to uh complete the look as you have so let's go let's see uh wow uh the hoodies are already they're all sold out anyway they got sweat bands or shred bands I should say uh so you can get the still uh 24.99 uh is now the price instead of uh uh what he had 1999 at the time so not a bad time especially if you say drop in subscribe and save 20 off uh pretty pretty sweet still five pack though so it's it's a little pricey per workout you definitely got to make each workout count um at uh you know five dollars a workout but uh let's check out Facebook here we got 1500 likes that's pretty pretty good there 35 off on Cyber Monday so you know I I feel like raising the price you know gives you that opportunity to do that as well hit those those sale uh those sales there so uh dropping the Adam Levine I can't even listen to a Maroon 5 song Anymore without thinking about Adam and how lame he is uh his Twitter got uh 26 people following over on the Twitter uh but Instagram got 14 800 followers which is pretty sweet considering the fact

ding ding thank you so much for being a part of this journey in this community uh it's it's been an absolute awesome ride I'll see you in one of these two videos over here take care and Kobe super ", "ChessUp": "next into the tank is a better way to learn how to play a classic [Music] game hi sharks I'm Jeff W and I'm Adam Rous we are two of the founders of bright Labs the makers of Chess up we're here seeking a $300,000 investment for a 5% equity share in our company wow sharks chess is a brilliant iant game it's great for the mind and it connects millions of people all around the world regardless of age or culture but chess has one king-sized problem it's really hard to learn and once you do learn it's even harder to improve making chess an intimidating game until now chess up is chess like you've never seen it before it has a built-in AI it teaches you how to play new to chess the magic is at your fingertips simply touch a piece and you're already learning how to play chess up features a patented artificial intelligence trainer that comes with six different levels of assistance now you really can learn and improve while you play and even let you play with a buddy who's halfway around the world with their moves instantly lighting up right on the board in front of you for the first time ever two players of any skill level can have a balanced competitive and fun match against each other chess up is soaring to success but there one piece that our chest set is missing a shark so who's ready to make a move and capture a whole lot of cash okay sharks you each have a chess up that's set up and ready to play once you touch a piece for white the AI on your side will show you all the available moves ranked by strength so green moves are the best and red moves are the worst then once you move the white piece the black side is going to show you where it wants you to move its piece and you can continue the game from there but it doesn't talk to you like I'm making those moves but I don't really understand the logic behind it there's a curated set of lessons that we have a professional chess teacher that actually walks you through different scenarios and teaches you different strategies that's what comes with not pertaining to this particular game not your exact game you're playing right now no I got it so I'm curious how much does this cost and what is it cost you to make it full retail is $3.99 uh we land it here for 120 okay so I played chess since I was 13 and I don't want to be told what I've got to do I want to play the AI we can control the level of assistance on either side you can uh adjust the settings on there to just see the legal moves and you receive no assist why is it so slow can I adjust the speed cuz I'm trying to play it quickly let us show you a video actually on this um the board can keep up with every human movement you can play bullet games Blitz Games which are very fast formats you're going to see that it's doing an automatic clock where it's keeping track of your time and the 's time wow that's fast that's cool so wait there's a ton of online chess platforms right there's a ton of software apps AB you why would I spend $399 when a lot of them are free or ad driven or whatever online chess is incredible we connect with those platforms and you can play just like you'd play online but you're playing on a real physical board so the the real difference is that you're playing on a physical board so you get the tactile feel yeah they just a preference and what online misses that family experience so are you doing this full-time or do you have a different job so we are very much full-time we met at the Innovation lab of a major consumer electronics brand between Jeff and myself were listed on over 20 patents and we're responsible for a lifetime revenue of over $1 billion can you name a product that you brought to Market that we would know sure so I did most recently Garmin Lily which is a women's smart watch it's really small and it's I wear the Garmin I love it oh that's fantastic perfect so I took the job at Garmin in an innovation Lab in order to take a step through entrepreneurship no joke when I started that job I'd never been around all the business term so I started watching Shark Tank I'm up here because of this show 3 years ago after a few hits you know watching these hundreds of millions of dollars for our employer and we were just getting paid salaries I decided to leave I called up Adam first we started prototyping these gadgets and the best concept we had when we were working was on this chess product so we took it to Kickstarter and from there we had enough revenue from Kickstarter to start the company your kick we did $1.7 million in 39 days wow what were you looking to raise uh We've set the goal at 30,000 that is crazy you raised 1.7 million but you're asking for 300,000 for 5% 6 million valuation what are your sales so we told you about the kickstarter sales that was 1.7 million since then we have not been running ads at all but we've just had people trickling to the website we've sold 400,000 this year to date Adam and Jeff I want to get the ball rolling this is a business I could do nothing for you it's not my thing I'm still on Checkers and struggling thank you bar so guys thank you why am I limited to the hardware platform I love chess I'm going to travel I'm always taking my laptop with me now I'm going to take this I'm going to take another bag with me um there's 50 million online chess players and we're not arguing that online chess doesn't have it Place million yeah there's 600 million people who play over a real board I was going to say there's something about chess pieces and doing it physically I mean to me playing chess on on a tablet feels terrible see I have no problem with the tablet guys I like chess I don't love it right I'll play it when my son wants to play it to me it doesn't matter if it's important and actually it's better when it's online cuz I can be wherever I just don't see it as a big enough market for me so for those Reasons I'm out and what will sales be this year so our sales for this year are going to be about $1.4 million are you going to make any money on the 1.4 yeah this year we'll actually book an accounting profit cuz all the deferred revenue from the pre-sales counts towards this year do you have any debt on the company yes we have we have some debt that's actually into a royalty uh structure what is how much so there's $392,000 that gives us we give 3.92% of our sales back to that it's 3.92% of sales until you've cleaned that up right that gets a 1.5 times return that sounds like one of my deals yeah you're very familiar with your deals so during Co and getting this thing done in just 15 months we went through a middleman because we can't visit the factories we manufacturing shins in and so he's taking a 20 30% cut we can drop that out almost instantly wow there's a lot of guys taking pieces of the pie in this steel but we got out quick and we're out we're ahe of competition I'm I'm looking at it and I'm one of these on the fence deals cuz I play the game I understand what you've done it's a complicated cap table right now complicated structure I'm going to take a pass I'm out listen I think you did an amazing job and I think there's something really important about touching and playing on a board when you're playing chess but I'm struggling because I I do wonder how am I going to make back my money if I said I wanted it for 300,000 for 10% um it's a tough got it's a tough one it really is can we we would love to work with you so let's let's think think about this um we can get you Capital back join in the royalty and another royalty yeah but what the Royal tell me entice me excite me yeah so uh how about $300,000 um we'll pay you back 3% of every sale until you're paid back 1.5 times so $450,000 we give you the 5% of the company it's not a bad count it's not bad at all uh guys let me let me I'll take it it's done yes deal got you guys are so smart thank you so much so excited exced thank you yeah thank you everyone for the time this has been congrats guys well done so much good luck I'm sorry Robert I had to do it Lori have another royalty but they're really not adding up to much we're still under 10% of a sale and we got the shark queen that we wanted it's amazing Lor is our Queen ", "ZipString": "next up is what the entrepreneurs believe will be the next big hit toy hello sharks I'm Austin hilum and I Steven fio

you want to do is you want to hold it upright like this with the logo facing oh yeah yeah there you go ulat your movements guys come on I love it we love it too did you invent it yes tell us the story how you came up with it I'm super passionate about Electronics a couple years ago I watched a physics teacher demonstrate a benchtop string launcher he had this device that would launch a string in a loop and I took that benchtop version I compacted it made it handheld and I made this prototype everybody loved it but I knew I couldn't make a scalable business out of it until I had Austin over where just nerding out about this device my father had some great input and we turned it into a toy I put that toy on my social media and by the end of the day it had over 20 million views wow what it hit the front page of Reddit oh my God it went just absolutely nuts we had everybody reaching out to us when was that was just over a year ago so how many of you sold from all that we sold over 10,000 that's it and how much did you charge for them char $25 25 why with 20 million views you only sold that it cost to make them it cost $635 so here's what happened so we did a Kickstarter ran that successfully an All-American commedy group known as Dude Perfect reached out they loved it they took it on a nationwide stage tour showed it around the world today zip string is in over 50 countries

as long as we have the cash how does that reduce the price cuz right now you're paying $635 to make them I know we can get it down to $587 $25 is too expensive I think so what is the expense in this a battery that's the largest expense that's correct why you think $25 for this is expensive too much should be for little kids yeah for parents to buy for their little kids5 is have you guys not bought

years after graduating college and then at the end of the day I was cooking and baking for the pros at the tennis club and that brought me the most Joy so then I decided I'm going to work in the culinary industry I was a private chef and caterer and now I run a successful Baking Company out of a commercial kitchen with a staff and Bakers why don't we talk some business so you've asked for 250,000 for 12% I'm going to make the Assumption you have some sales so why don't well Kevin as I said my business is blooming overall lifetime sales 2.2 million whatow wow 2020 we did just north of

that's right wow some proud cookies how much money you going to make well so let me just tell you last year we uh walked away with 330 I must tell you I never set out to start a company I was just making food posting it on Instagram and my photos went viral and the largest national Publications you could think of started featuring my work multiple times wa Vogue magazine Three Times opra magazine three times New York Times LA Times goo magazine or goop uh Harper's Bazaar who's doing your social media I do everything so what do you do work 25 hours a day I work so hard that begs the question what are you looking for in a sharp I would love a Mentor I don't have any so it would be incredible to have a partner to give me advice Barbara will you be my mentor laia this is a beautiful artisanal custom very high-end product do you worry that as you achieve scale some of that beauty of the product and uniqueness may not scale for sure I see so much opportunity with the products that I've created as well as the other ideas that I have and I think that I could see my cookies in Starbucks at $50 no a pack of two for $7 so you're you don't want to lower your price point you you would package it different I do I would love to have a a price point that's more accessible I have an idea of a cookie there's a lot of competitors doing that what's unique about your story here is you actually make money because you're premium anyways I've heard enough I'm going to make you an offer maybe you like it maybe you don't you're going to be a lot of work but Kevin no listen I'm going to make you an offer it's good news not bad news okay all right let's hear it I'll give you the 250,000 I want 25% hell woo can you offer say it again 25% the vision of my company that you have for my company yeah going to keep it premium okay you can't compete in The Confectionary space at a low price that space is completely full of competitors that have scale I'm going to help you stay premium and blow your story up you are the brand I mean you're walking in here like a flower girl cuz you are one you got to keep that but that's a lot of work I got to get paid for that so I want 25% offer what do I think of it I want to hear your offer Lori well listen I think it's absolutely beautiful you are a luxury item you are but I don't see this as the right business for me I wish you good luck but I'm out thank you Gloria I I mean one of the hardest thing to do is establish a brand right away and get a high price point and you've done a remarkable job I don't see the investable side of this business um not for me I'm out thank yout yeah laor let me let me add to that a company is you you're the brand products are incidental when you deal with media the story has to be about you and building yourself you know to be the Martha Steward of flowers you know edible flowers because trying to be mainstream will backfire against you but it it's not a fit for me I'm out but I think you have to focus on you because that that's what makes this the 25 50 or100 million doll company did you say anything about taking your product out of the premium space I didn't get that L thing well I would like to create a line of products that could be sold at Whole Foods and I have a lot of ideas but you're not in retail now are you no I'm not in retail that that's a hellish space in this area you don't want to be there it's very hard to compete you could get scared away I don't get the feeling you're the type of person that gets scared away if you think of something you're going to try it for Barber what no I might make you an offer because I'll tell you what I love about you what I like about you is you're ambitious bar the part that bothers me why I I'm hesitant to make an offer it's not because I don't believe in you or the product I I'm all in on that but I don't get really again why you need another partner I like to be valuable to somebody like I make a difference I think you'd be very valuable to my business I want to keep growing I work so hard I do everything and I need to hire an operations manager somebody to take me out is that what the 250s for part of it is for that and I wanted to invest towards developing a cpg product but the best investment of your money is in the right people right if that's really what you need in a partner I am your girl so if you really need my help on that I'll give you an offer okay 250,000 15% I don't think you're asking too much you just say yes Barbara you have a deal I'm going to cry I'm so excited a that's great conrat you have to give me that dress terrific you're great ex congrat great job good job job I will be a customer for sure she thank you it was an honor knowing that Barbara is my partner is mindblowing I'm so happy oh my gosh I can't even imagine what we're going to create together and I'm so excited ", "Foam Party Hats": "next into the tank is a way to make any celebration more festive [Music] hi

nothing for you true nuts can change the world yeah i know right so guys please take the hat reach out inside and you'll find a little switch so there you go it gets even better that is tremendous okay you guys are ready i have a question do you design all of these and make all of them so she designs everything you know we mentioned that we have 600 hats it's because a lot of the the products that we have created because people reach out to us and ask for custom hats so when i go online to find phone party hats am i going to find you at the top of that list of course and that's that's that's what drives sales just that keyword has been what us bring all the business to us they always get a big orders average sale is 240 or so how much is a hat so this one is 25 this one is 40. how much is this expensive that one is 35. loris is 50. how much does it cost you to make a 45 hat uh cost of product will be around two three dollars and seven dollars will be the the employees it's cool that you're able to customize but most times you want to have one or two or ten items that you can crank out and just sell a huge amount let me finish explaining the business model so people you know weddings is our biggest uh or biggest market like eighty percent of our sales weddings yeah the wedding industry that i have many companies in that business has grown to a halt since march 17th is anybody getting married here so yeah so we have changed our business model while the pandemic hits basically our our sales decreased like 80 one week i was sleeping two three hours because i was freaking out but one day i woke up and i was like i hate when people just stay without doing nothing and crying about like oh my god we're not going to be able to make it especially you know people dying and we had no excuse to just do nothing so i went to amazon starting investigating how to be really proficient on amazon so first month in march we did like 800 dollars worth but then i spent many hours at night figuring out how to do keyword seo electronics career sales on amazon last month last month 6 000. good for you when the wedding business was big what were your sales on a monthly okay so let me just tell the overall sales so when we started 2017 we did 25 000 in sales 2018 we got 75 000 dollars in sales and then last year we did 145 000 in sales this year right now we have sold eight thousand dollars more than last year which for me i think is amazing it's great based on that on the pandemic right is anything automated or automatable not right now but that's why we're here we need the money to scale up big big time what did you do to get people to you nothing nothing what did you do during the pandemic oh the pandemic so i have a have a let me show you something real i was waiting for this give it one second so one thing um while the pandemic hits is that everything was everything everything was about a great idea social differences so i told my mom let's just make something that is like a virus but let's make it fun so people don't get offended by it how many of those have you sold we have sold around 300 of these look companies that service parties and weddings get 80 of their sales from 20 of their product line that's the business model that works but you don't have that model yet it's a great business for you it's a family business you guys are terrific i feel bad about saying i'm out but i know before before you say anything i just did guys let me let me step in your biggest challenge here is you don't know what business you're in you think you're in the foam hat business and you're trying to figure out how to sell more phone ads you're in the fun business correct right you figured out how to sell fun when you did your virus hats you just want to keep on creating ideas and using seo because you can control your own destiny but you don't know what business you're in yet so for those reasons i'm out manuel i might be giving you an offer based on how you answer the following questions do you own 100 of the business 80 and 20. 80 for guys is this your full-time job no i have a full-time job i'm a chemical engineer and are you willing to make this your full-time job of course that's why we're here are you sure because the only way i'll give you an offer is if you're fully yes of course like i don't know about that but you're not investing so yeah but i'm just trying to help i'm trying to help my friend men well let me let me just tell you where i'm at sorry daniel just to clear things up there's two things i really admire about you guys one is the hustle and the other one is your ability to just make no excuses it's a great business for you but as an investment it's not for me so i'm out thank you robert appreciate it listen i love you guys i love your energy there's just a ton of work to be done like i calculate i'm going to be putting another 200 000 in my team members time to just help you guys along i don't think you have figured out how to mass scale at kind we master amazon we need to deploy your creativity and together i think with some guidance i think we will build a huge business the offer is a hundred thousand dollars for 30 percent and it is not negotiable because it's going to be on top of the hundred thousand dollars a ridiculous amount of work not a bad offer don't quit your job huge mistake manuel i love when these sharks have all these comments but they will back out let me just tell you all the things he wants to do are gonna cost more than a hundred thousand dollars [Music] mark cuban forbids you getting any money here you ask for more money listen what i think you're missing is marketing expertise right i want daniel to have me join him as a partner i'm really good at marketing and i'm really working with you later but this deal is just going to take so much focus and attention i will help you guys figure it out but i think i need to go on this we're going alone yes he just threw you under a bus [Music] mark you want to go in with me just to mess with daniel go in with me why don't we do a hundred thousand dollars for 25 let's do this so the way to do this meanwhile grace is you do what you did with with the virus hat that's where your creativity comes shining through and you combine that with not just your seo abilities but our seo abilities right then you can keep your job what are you talking about you need him to figure this stuff out unless you're going to work no cause he wants to do this grace emmanuel you have two offers you got to get focused now you've got mark who came back in after barking at you like a dog all day and then you've got daniel who wants to put you full time mark and lori's offer does not require you to quit your job manuel this is the key question what do you want to do with your life we love you daniel honestly what you're doing is amazing but having too sharp for 25 percent experience wait a second i will do it i i want to say at the at this point i will like we're still facing up and then we i need a stability just in case something happens gloria my vision sorry i'm sorry i really appreciate it but this is a really good offer for us mark and laurie thank you so much guys we're gonna crush man oh my god now we'll do our money dance yeah we need a shark thank you guys get ready guys get ready come on [Music] you know what's the lesson don't undermine lori when she wants a deal you need to go with her elsewhere no don't trust asked you you foreign me and you said no i respectfully said i needed to lose one alone that's not throwing under the bus okay but i don't have to sit back and go okay you ", "Flated": "next up is an ingenious storage solution for Road [Music] [Music] Trippers hello sharks I'm Ken hovy I'm Monique kefir and I'm Ryan gay and today we are here asking for $350,000 for 5% of our company flated oh sharks what if I told you that this backpack back has enough room that you can fit everything that you need to quickly and easily transform your car truck or SUV for your next road trip adventure traditional camper shells and rooftop carriers can be a great option to transport and protect your travel and camping gear but what do you do with them when your trip is over and you just want your vehicle back to normal for regular daily use introducing flated the world's first rigid inflatable air carrier air topper and air deck the perfect way to maximize your vehicle's recreational potential oh wow yet minimize the space these accessories usually take up when not in use all of our products at flated will go toet to- Toe with those that are made out of metal plastic even fiberglass except for ours are way lighter they install without tools and once they're deflated they store in a backpack that means that you're no longer forced to decide between leaving them on your vehicle when they're not even in use or taking them off and then trying to figure out where to store them our patent pending Automotive accessories are specifically designed to create usable space when you need it but then save it when you don't and best of all they're super easy to install even by yourself we inflated are pioneering new ways that this material can be used and we want you to be a member of our team so sharks who's ready to get plated uh sharks in front of you as an example so that you can understand the material itself uh is a cross section of drop stitch so you can kind of look at it feel the rigidity and have an idea on what we're talking about and what we're doing what's the weave in the middle here it looks like you have long strands of something yeah so that's what drop stitch is all about it has thousands of fibers that connect that top sheet and bottom sheet essentially making it a panel L if you'd like you could go ahead and open yeah this will show you what it does so so now this is off yes ma'am you just push the button in it's going to make a little explosion of air there you go and you can turn it easy there there you Ryan is that your technology you've probably seen it before in uh different water sports why do you say you have some kind of pending patent on it if it's not yours our patents all about using drop stitch inflatable technology for usable space in automobiles oh I see so you don't make the technology you're just applying it for a different correct that's right quick quick little backstory in 2009 the three of us were working with one of the Premier paddle board companies in the outdoor industry when inflatable paddle boards came to Market Market all of our competitors laughed at us they were like those things are pool toys they're going to pop now fast forward to today the worldwide market for paddle boards is 90% inflatable so we feel like we're bringing a proven Technology power paddle board board did a really good job in that market comp okay what does it cost you to make it and what do you sell it for for the topper $1,800 the landed cost on the Toppers is around 740 how much are the beds the beds are between 5 50 and $6.99 depending on the size what are the percentage breakout in sales is the topper the Elsa Primo our our Toppers are about 80% of sales so far dollarwise which we were quite shocked cuz that's our highest price point I have a Ford 150 if I want a Topper what is it going to cost me to a traditional hard today if you walked in to get a a fiberglass topper with paint matched and everything you'd probably be looking at 3500 on up they this is a price Advantage by 50% almost and I can ship it anywhere in the country to your doorstep year to date this year what are your sales year to date we're at 277,000 we plan to hit 600,000 this year um we do have some hard Po's from a national retailer let me riddle you this why is this thing worth 7 million bucks ooh we do have an over $100,000 purchase order like we said from a national retailer so you're going to make 50 Grand on that that that doesn't mean this is worth $7 million maybe there's other things to ask have you raised any money yes okay how much money have you raised we raised $500,000 okay and how much of your own money is in this uh we we only put in $200 each when we formed our LLC to pay our California LLC tax but it's not your full-time job guys uh some of us Ryan has left his position as a VP of sales I still have a job that's 3/4 of time I live near Vale Colorado and uh I work for a premier Hotel there as a Bellman guys I'm going to tell you this I don't think you're worth what you're you're asking for you haven't hit it so unfortunately I wish you good luck but I'm out thank you so much it's an honor to be here okay so look you got to be very careful on Shark Tank that you don't price yourself out of the market I actually think the product works okay got a lot of work ahead of you to make this thing sell and frankly I don't know why you're selling anything else except the topper because it's 80% of your sales so far REI loves this carrier because it's so versatile and can go on anything I got it but I I'm an investor I actually think your company's worth around a million bucks you're the company I'm the investor sometimes we agree on valuation sometimes we don't this is one of those we don't I'm out thank you so much M wonderful to me your challeng is this is a a touch to trust product in other words just putting out videos is not enough because you don't really know that you can trust it you have to go where people are at whether it's hunting and camping shows whatever it may be when it's a touch to trust product it's really hard to get that hockey stick growth right which is what I look for so for those reasons am out I loved it like as soon as you came out I got it like I got it and I I fully get what Mark is saying some companies are hockey sticks some companies you just got to grind it out my problem with it is I almost sense you're on the edge of a cliff and you just don't want to jump in in a grinding business you got to jump off the cliff and you got to go work there every day there is never going to be the perfect time where you have enough money in the bank account what are you waiting for even with my full-time job I I don't sit on a clock and not answer emails or not answer we have I'm not suggesting that for a moment and I think you guys probably work 24 hours a day like all of us work hours day but the problem is in a grinding business like this where you've got to sell one at a time you got to be working here fulltime 24 hours a day and we've having this argument about you can run the business part-time while working full-time at it I don't buy it sorry I'm out thanks Robert [Music] Damon I think the Sharks brought up a lot of really good points um you really need more sales you should have blown out of this so something's not converting but I like the product so I'll off you 350 for 8% of every unit sold is that a royalty de like smell I think so 8% of every unit sold and then when uh I recuit my money I'll I'll take it down to 5% our challenge is it is a high margin dollar item so wait a sec it's not that crazy cuz if you sell a top for 1,800 bucks 8% royalty $144 and you have $350,000 wor a capital what's wrong with that I mean frankly I don't know how you could get an equity deal here with a crazy valuation of seven that's a creative offer yeah it's actually not that bad if you do the math the amount that you would pay in royalties versus the equity you would give up and the value of that it's not so bad what do you want to do can I give you a quick counter of course about 7% and then the perpetuity would be at 4% uh let me think about that no Dam it I think it's a very fair offer right now you get to keep your Equity cuz that's part of the challenge I mean you stay in control of the business what do you want to do how do you guys operate making decisions you need two out of three to make a decision it's whatever Monique wants to do it's obvious so what would you guys like to do no my concern is um we're already struggling a little bit with the cash flow to purchase more inventory think how you're going to feel if you walk out of here and you don't take his offer because if I were to give you a little advice I think you really could use him I think he would really help you okay here's the deal if take I doing that I know ready yeah Damon let's do this good job good job guys all right thank you thank you thank you let me thank you Boss I appreciate it thank you too all right thank you congrats guys yes oh my God that so awesome kisses I'm feeling total excitement uh just energized I believe in our product so much sky limit and like we said at the very beginning we are just getting started ", "Pluie": "[Music] first in the tank is a modern version of a common baby [Music] accessory hi sharks I'm Addie and I'm Britney we are the moms behind

eliminating 99.9% of harmful bacteria and viruses all within 60 seconds Lou multi-purpose handles keep your diaper bag off the restroom floor and your hands free to change your child or catch that Rogue pacifier before it hits the ground so sharks who's ready to reimagine the public diaper changing experience and protect our most vulnerable join us and together we can change the table you know this is a busino business place and actual airport authorities I bet you the sales Cycles forever that's a great question so we do have our first airport speaking of airports it's DFW so if you're flying home check it out Terminal C we are currently in 11 large national accounts this includes CVS Equinox Old Navy Top Golf Costco Simon Property Group Westfield Jamestown graduate Hotel Group Lego and Peppa Pig theme park of course our airport and then some stadiums we have over 115 locations so averaging two to three tables 115 your total out there how many have you sold so about 30000 so you're only at three and this is not really a this is this is not a problem you're piloting it correct and what do you sell them for $26.99 26 $2,699 699 so what does this cost you to make the cost for the UV version is 1312 $1,312 wow so if I have a th stores okay and I want to retrofit this device over the old plastic one that did not require an electrical outlet okay this does oh that's a great point so when I have to put this in I need to do an installation of infrastructure I have to make sure that it's compliant with the electrical code in that state that location because those tubes require voltage and the other one doesn't and I'm going to look at that in addition to your $26.99 cost this roll out is going to be really challenging really electrical has not been an issue price really hasn't been a barrier how many minutes does it have to stay closed to sanitize 99.9% 60 seconds oh yeah okay what is your backgrounds how do you know each other so I spent 15 years in product development from commercial fitness equipment to fishing boats and now diaper chaining tables I was the first female president of a fishing boat business business an $8 million fishing boat business you president of the company excellent but I was introduced to Addie through a former colleague of mine and she said Britney is a new mom you're changing a lot of diapers in public restrooms my friend has this great idea you could say I took a bit of a non-traditional career path uh I was a physics major when I dropped out of college to attend culinary school and I had some very non-glamorous jobs in restaurants including Michelin star restaurant which landed me after a lot of hustle uh training under Daniel belut in New York I then so you became a chef I became a chef I worked for Thomas Keller for many years and then I left fine dining to work for Martha Stewart which was a dream job and while working for her in my late 20s I went back to college and got my bachelor's degree from NYU with a full ride and then I had my son I became incredibly interested in the public diaper changing experience I then filed my Utility Patent in 2019 I raised my first round of funding through friends and family while on maternity leave with my daughter so I had another baby throughout about this what was the valuation and how much did you raise I raised 650,000 in about 6 weeks on maternity leave and the valuation was a 4 million cap on a convertible note is that all you is that it no that was in 201920 and then 2021 we raised a million another convertible note uh at an 8 million valuation 8 mil and then just recently we raised our first price round so we just raised 2 million in May at a $20 million valuation you might as just keep on raising all of this money raised has been through individuals it's all been people we've met through our personal and professional Network so you guys raised about 3.6 million from family and friends at about a $20 million valuation you're in front of us with a $10 million valuation why we're really looking for someone or some people who are more strategic and help us really accelerate our growth uh and we believe and they're okay with taking a 50% cut correct let's get to the nuts and bolts then how much cash do you have in the bank we about 1.4 million okay so you're not cash constrained then how many orders do you have that are waiting to be delivered about 550,000 revenue and so Revenue 250 units basically what have you actually sold this year we have 150,000 Revenue books total total how much cash will you lose this year we'll lose about 500,000 oh what did you lose last year we lost about a million about a million okay this is a difficult deal your valuation guys at 10 million I don't care what people paid for it you're not worth $10 million you're miles from it you're basically pre-revenue you're a prototype at this point and I wish you the best but I'm out well here's what I think both of you are clearly operators but I think the the bigger challenge is it it's not going to stop me or make me go to some location due to this if I'm forced to be in that situation where the child has to be changed the child has to be changed where it seems like we may be going uh in this next 2 to 3 years I think retailers are going to be taking a risk at how much they lay out not knowing if we're going to go into a deep recession a light recession I think they're going to cut back on things like this I just don't think it's going to be able to scale at this point so I'm out the the the problem is parents have been leaving a business to go change their children in the car leaving a business to go at home and then they're ordering off Amazon look I agree with all of those things but the consumer is not the one buying it you've invented a beautiful product but it's five six times the cost of something large companies have to do they have to put in a changing table they don't have to put on this but a 10 million valuation I don't share the same level of certainty as you do I'm out do you share a level of certainty at a lower valuation well how much lower because you're given your investor a haircut and the question becomes what is it specifically that you're missing yeah you know specifically what we came here for is again we know how to Market this we know how to sell it we want to do it faster and we truly believe with a partner like one of you there's something that I can't get my arms around that's slowing you down this is obvious in what it does the first time you walk into the restroom and somebody uses why aren't they ordering and installing more it's because they don't have to they already have a solution we've been talking a lot about large national accounts I mean there are 4 million public restrooms that's where this falls apart because the person that wants it the consumer that you talked about so much is not the person that buys [Music] it Mark what are you going to do yeah guys it does it doesn't all add up I'm sorry I'm out listen as a woman in business I admire your grit I think you are both so smart so hardworking so accomplished I love the idea and the concept I think it's brilliant I think the real problem is it's pricey right now I see it as premium I have have a high-end restaurant I'm going to put that in instead if I have a high-end store I'll put that in but if I'm you know every day where customers are coming in anyway I might not because it's a huge expense I think that there's a concern for me about what's going to happen as far as really going widespread at too high a price point so I will cheer for you but unfortunately on this one I'm out than thank you so much Lori give us six more months yeah we're cheering for you it's a much better solution good Lu you guys it's very smart thanks so much I think ultimately we're still pretty early on you know they would have wanted to see further growth and purchasing from our large national accounts I think the stage we're at they just weren't so sure if it was going to grow as quickly as they wanted it to and we're here to prove them it [Music] will ", "Sweetkiwi": "[Music] [Applause] next up is a sweet Indulgence without the [Music] guilt hi sharks I'm AA and I'm Michael we seek $250,000 for 5% of our company Sweet kiwi sharks as a married couple and parents and business partners we can tell you life is all about B but when it comes to eating we all struggle to balance eating healthy with eating what tastes good let's be honest all the indulging stuff we love isn't good for us and that's where we come in with sweet kiwi that's right sweet kiwi is real Greek yogurt whipped to Frozen Perfection it's not just any frozen yogurt it's an amazing delicious whipped Greek frozen yogurt low in calorie that's surprisingly great for you it's made with nutrient-dense ingredients and it supports gut health and wellness it's made from real milk source from small holder family-owned farms and each pint Bast of 22 g of protein Prebiotic fiber gut healthy probiotics and a unique blend of immunity boosting superfoods all of which work better together kind of like us exactly so sharks who's excited about whipping up the frozen dessert aisle with sweet and changing the way consumers experience food in front of you we have six different flavors we have vanilla bean cookies and cream chocolate hazelnut which are our classic flavors you have a raspberry fro which is one of our Innovative flavors a hibiscus and ginger which is one of our more inclusive flavors and our mango mojito as well the raspberry fro is amazing it is that's actually my favorite actually oh my God I love the cookies and cream thank you how much added sugar do you put into this um so each pint has averagely between 35 to 40 G of total sugars that good okay so tell us about you like how did you come up with this and what what's your background um so my background I'm from Nigeria I was born in Nigeria raised between Nigeria and the UK and then I moved to Dallas Texas yeah go Ms um so when I was in Dallas I was diagnosed with a uterine fibroid and I had to go see a doctor and I was just 22 at the time and she was telling me all this stuff about surgery and so I started thinking maybe a lifestyle change could be a different um solution and so I started researching I changed my diet started eating better but I struggled with the dessert part and I found frozen yogurt but I started realizing it was just not healthy so much sugar lowfat but crazy amount of sugar so I started making the stuff in my home kitchen did yes and and you have no Chef or ice cream background no and I kept getting better at it and then I went to Penn State to perfect the recipe I've taken all the courses from culture dairies to ice cream manufacturing and just kept getting better and um that's how sweet kiwi came about I was about to open a store in Dallas and my brother was getting married in Nigeria and so I went to Nigeria and I decided they didn't have anything healthy at all so we opened stores in Nigeria we grew that business in Nigeria yes correct retail stores morar stores wow so I grew that business to one of the biggest frozen yogurt companies in Africa and we went how long ago was this how long ago wow this I I started in 2011 really and what's it called there sweet swe oh same name same name it's still around it's still running it now is the international business part of this offer no it's not so sweet kiwi in the US is separate is registered as a separate uh SPV by itself how how big is it give lifetime revenue is about $2 million we want to take all the success that we've been an experience and be able to take that experience to build a cpg brand in focused on the American Business and so came back here and I started getting approached by people who thought that it was a phenomenal product and that's how we relaunched we were approached by Whole Foods and right now we're in Whole Food stores Walmart stores how many so we're just in about 1,700 stores that's not bad so we've been in hoods for over 2 years we just launched in Walmart this year we just launched this month into Kroger nationally what are the USA sales so so this year we've already done $650,000 and we're on track to do about between 1.2 to 1.4 by end of year wow can you walk us through the price Model what does it sell for at retail and average okay so our products are sold between $44.97 all the way up to $6.99 how how does that compare we're pretty competitive in comparison to other products on the Shelf but if you think about what makes swe kiwi so unique that it's the only frozen whipped Greek yogurt on the Shelf so guys if you make 600,000 this year will you break even will you lose money will you make money so we already uh Break Even cash flow we're not looking for outside cap to be profitable what we're really focusing on on is to one Builder brand Market in and really focusing on taking to that I've heard enough I'm going to make you an offer okay it's going to reflect the risk I see inherent in this deal um this category is very crowded the fact that you've got Kroger very hard to get in I'll give you $250,000 for 20% okay wow thank you for your offer we would like to hear other absolutely all right so listen my my thoughts are you're extremely impressive to open a business in a whole another country but at the valuation as well as it being one of my first Journeys heading down this route it's an expensive education for me um I love the product but as for the business I'm out thank you thank you very much guys you you alluded to the marketing you know how do you convey that this is great you know cuz you're not big enough to go and do a national ad campaign what works right so right now what works for us is doing demos um doing promos um often times and your cost cost of good sold right now average is $2.25 our goal is to get that under 220 because as we reach economies of scale we'll eventually get there why because one you have to price in the promotions you have to price in the marketing that's all part of the model what we've been able to achieve over the last year we went from selling under 320 to now selling above 420 that's your wholesale price that's our wholesale price that's really expensive you know guys you got you got an offer on the table you know you got an offer on the table we're also getting a lot of press coverage we're feature I know but you know like in my I I'm rooting for you you have an offer on the table what were you going to say I was saying coming back to what you said earlier Mark you brought up the very valid point biggest problem that we have to solve right now is marketing how do we build a brand and how do we tell a story in a very very cluttered world that's actually what the capital is actually going to be used for you know based on my frozen farmer experience right I mean we worked really hard to be really successful isn't it competitive it's working yeah it is is um I love the product but I'm sorry I'm going to have to be out she wants to kick your ass guys let me let me step in look I kept on asking about marketing because it is the hardest question corre you've solved every other question but there's huge uncertainty and you didn't really have a response of what you're going to do I don't know for certain what that path is so for those Reasons I'm out I don't know for certain what's going to happen I don't know what's going to happen for C tomorrow either yeah but at least you have a marketing plan for your products well Mark can I just say that um when I started this business in 2011 I was so unsure I never thought I'd be an entrepreneur I always wanted to do something that was going to help people I wanted to work for the UN I was volunteering for the IRC in Dallas you in Dallas of course and and um the one reason I knew that I could do this was the exciting out gone I don't know what you're doing you say you're an entrepreneur you focus on the money they're all out there's only one guy left I made an offer when there was all these shs Robert is Mr Wonderful's pissed okay I'm out still in I understand your piss care I don't care I'm out you got Robert go for it you know I've learned uh business about making money not always about emotion I mean that's just that's just v m and I'll cry if I want to yeah you can you are you know there is no well Robert you step up there is no certainty in life right right I mean you you went to a country you didn't know anything my dad came here at 37 on a boat didn't even speak the language what certainty did he have what I look for is with people that can land on their feet and adapt adaptability is the greatest strength of an entrepreneur I don't have a lot of investment in this space but I love this space and I want to learn and I've been looking to learn with somebody I've been looking to partner with somebody where I can use my Capital my experience with Enterprises and we can build something greater and there are no two better people that I'm going to put my money into than the two of you why can't this be a 50 million hundred million business and I can help you get there so I will pick up Kevin's emotional theatrics off the ground thank you very much I'll pick up that same offer all we give you the 250,000 for 20% and why not us C can I make a counter offer come on after that great speech man I'll tell you what I'll tell you what before the speech that was pretty good the answer I love the only good answer that was yes baby I love the speech I I'd like to counter by saying we'd like to offer you 71.1% in equity and throw in 5% advisor shares your counter is 250,000 for 122% for 7.1% in stra equity 5% advisor sh 12.1 total I'll go down I'll split the difference with you I'll go I'll go 250,000 for 16% I mean we're both learning here you got to believe in me I believe in you we can make this thing happen What do you it's come on us okay so we appreciate the offer and would like to say yes well wasn't sure what was coming after thatg awesome thank you very much great job my gosh so impressive guys congrats than you very much nice sa great job thank you when Mr Wonderful said he was pissed we certainly didn't want him to be pissed you never want to leave a good offer on the table so when Robert came in we really jumped at the opportunities to close the deal we're going to grow this company into become an $100 million company that a billion dollar company absolutely that's right ", "Woof": "next in the tank is a safety app for beloved family [Music] members hi sharks my name is RC and I live in New York City with my three dogs Marty Hank and Odin AKA The Three Musketeers today I'm seeking $100,000 in exchange for 10% ownership in my company wolf sharks America loves their pets in fact over 70% of American households have a pet but what would happen to those pets if something unexpected had to happen to the owner like a car accident or a heart attack or a shark attack as the dog out of three living in New York City that scenario terrifies me and that's why I created wolf a smartphone app that's designed to rescue your pet if something unexpected happens to you Wolf's mission is to bring pet parents PE peace of mind so how does the app work wo utilizes a geolocation timer that is linked to your home address that automatically starts when you leave home and stops when you return you preset that timer and if that timer ever expires before you return home that means your pets well-being may be at risk and wolf support structure kicks in first we're going to reach out to you then your emergency contact list and if we can't confirm your pet safety we're going to initiate a wellness check to come rescue your pet best of all wolf utilizes a set it and forget it model and works entirely in the background so sharks who wants to throw me a bone and come join the wolf pack let me get this right have you sold any of this to anybody oh of course the app's been out for about 3 months there's been four instances of support it has not escalated to a point where we need to go and rescue the dogs thankfully but um they've you know gone out for longer than they expected their timer expired and were happy that I went and checked in on them but this could apply to any scenario if you're going to work you're already out for 8 hours you're on the way home you get into a car accident you then go to the hospital and you don't have family around in the city then your dogs are going to be in that apartment or house whatever you have for a long time it's part of your service that somebody from the wolf network will actually go to my house walk the dogs feed the dogs let's say step two happens your emergency contacts don't answer we then wait to hours we go to step three the final step of support we initiate a wellness check that means we contact the local authorities they come to your house and then if you're not available they can't find you or contact you they would take that dog with them and keep trying to get a hold of in your house get the dog yeah yeah and they they have means to do that the Poli wellness check so we get to the point where there's a reason to go do a wellness check and you call the police and that's a normal service that they offer freee service free government service right but now something has to happen with the dog right the police don't offer that service to babysit the dog what happens then so they would contact Animal Welfare until a family member or ideally you the owner would come and claim that pet now we have another step answer this for me is there a person from your company that is taking care of my dog if I can no that's that's almost the business model is that our costs are to make phone calls and initiate you're acier service yeah event and so you have three dogs that mean the world to you what made you think of doing this yes so I was driving and I almost got into a car accident and rather than my life flashing before my eyes my dog's lives Flash before my eyes cuz my family lives in Maryland I'm in New York and that terrified me that's when I said I can fix this issue with technology and you would be shocked when I go and talk to pet parents around New York City they always say wow that is a genius idea it's a real with pet parents they don't have how users do you have now that think it's important and what is it cost it's $2.99 a month or $29.99 a year it's very cheap and how many users do you have that PID I have 3177 downloads and 102 subscriptions here's the thing I've only spent $2,400 on marketing the rest has been me bootstrapping in New York City that's not horrible that's impressive yeah mean I had no idea that people would actually give you $299 it's kind of like an emotional insurance here's the thing it's not just for dogs it's for any pet you see the cat right there that looks pretty sad it's for cats birds dogs but obviously you know so my challenge is this the name wolf is you're never going to be able to keep that because it's a very common name do you own that name uh no I don't the the company name is wolfel LLC so you didn't do enough homework to lock up the name and you're going to have a lot of challenges with that and all of what we're talking about here is going to go down the drink and someone's going to send you a c and assist and you're not even going to be able to take advantage of this opportunity right now um so I wish you the best of luck but I'm out I just don't see it I'll tell you why the problem with your entire premise is you're catering to the very very small percentage of people who don't have friends or family within a geographic location because if I got sick I would have one of my friends do this service for me so Robert I'm on the streets of New York and I hear feedback people talk I don't want you to waste your time with me cuz you're a good guy so I'm I'm out but I think you got I me I have to say I think it's super admirable and nice you love your pets it's really Insurance just in case it's the piece of Mind exactly so I get that but for me I just don't see it as the right investment I'm sorry I'm out thank you Lor you know I love flyers and I like crazy stuff I thought you were completely nuts when you you started but now I see the Merit what you're doing I I just you might like this so my costs right now to Ron wolf are less than $100 a month because you have no employees it's just you but that's the thing I don't need employees until I at least skill to 5,000 10,000 downloads R you're going to you can't have your your cell phone blowing up and you're saying what you're dead you're in a car accident you're stuck in Atlanta like you can't do that yourself you have to build out a call center and everything else which is which is war up a little bit but not warm enough to give you $100,000 I'm out look I think it's a great idea the challenge is that in order to make a lot of money you have to have a lot of subscribers yeah what I look at is okay can it get to a million or 5 million Subs right I don't see that I just I just don't see a path from where you want it to be to big great return for investor well so for that reason I'm out thank you okay listen thank you good luck RC stay with thanks guys I appreciate it I didn't get a deal today but that's okay I think they gave me a lot of great advice and I'm going to keep pushing through I feel like they don't think that it's a big enough problem I feel like they don't think that pet parents really worry about this and that's honestly not true they're not the ones in the streets talking to people so um I think they're going to regret not giving a deal ", "Autio": "next up is a way to make your road trips more enriching hi sharks my name's Woody Sears and I'm a travel fanatic from Santa Barbara California today I'm here seeking $1 million in exchange for 5% equity in my company wow when my family and I take road trips we find ourselves asking a lot of questions about the places around us we like to know how a small town came to be what people do there for a living and the names of the mountains and places we drive by wouldn't it be great if we had a personal tour guide who could share these stories introducing AO AO is a Mobile Audio Entertainment app for travel that tells stories about the places landmarks and cities that we drive by it uses geolocation technology to to trigger these stories by your location automatically simply press play and stories begin based on where you are stories like these local residents passed an ordinance prohibiting the Horseless Carriage which was startling and upsetting their horses it was a stop on the Underground Railroad as many homes here and in nearby Springdale were as well violent eruptions caused the mouth of the volcano to collapse forming a nearly symmetrical 4,000 ft deep C ER we have over 9,000 Stories spanning the US Each of which is told by professional narrators we have famous voices like Kevin cner Phil Jackson and John litho AO gives us a chance to be entertained while at the same time taking a break from screens and being more engaged with our surroundings and each other so sharks who wants to hit the road with AO and help tell our next story very cool walk me through an example I buy the product so there's an AIO app right there's an AIO app you download it from the App Store it's free to download it comes with five free stories and you enable location and notification preferences as then as soon as you come into range of a story that you haven't heard it will automatically begin to play if you used up your five free stories then we offer you unlimited streaming for $36 a year how long are your stories they're 3 to 4 minutes on average and some go up as much as 20 minutes if I bought the app and I'm in the middle of nowhere and I have no Wi-Fi access I assume I don't hear stories and the other side of that if I'm in New York City driving down Madison Avenue I would think I would have a story every 3 seconds yeah the the stories are evenly distributed throughout the country interstates highways byways Scenic roads so you are going to have more in the urban centers but if you go really remote you're going to be offline out of Wi-Fi out of cellular and you can download those stories to your device and they'll still be triggered by the GPS radio so you're going to hear the stories while you're in the national park or another what's your background how did you I do have background I've spent the last 19 years in software and mobile um the last company that I started was called I story time we made the first library of narrated story books for the iPhone we ended up producing over 200 apps and 14 million downloads and then got acquired wow I got I got to ask because it's very rare in Shark Tank where a guy walks in and says 1 million for 5% I mean I just have to understand why you would do that we have the number one podcast Radio Network and largest podcast publisher who will also be coming in as investors and strategic Partners this valuation is actually a discount to what they'll be paying please tell me you have sales we we have sales we've done over 700,000 this year 210,000 this last year and we're on a $2 million annual run rate well that's respectable how much money have you guys raised so far we've raised 3 and A2 million so far we have the largest Auto Club in the nation on our cap tablea AAA as well as the the biggest retailer of RVs in the country yeah but I'm just curious why do you need a shark we want people who who feel strongly about our mission and can help get the word out there this is a new product category so a lot of people are unfamiliar with it Woody how many subscribers do you have we have 15,000 paid members 210,000 registered accounts and over half million downloads and what percentage have renewed we've from the earliest subscribers they're renewing at 70% on average it's about 50% it's a 50% attrition rate 50% which is average for Consumer subscription Services wow I didn't know that Woody let let me just get things started I'm just not a fan I'm sorry I think Google Maps everything about it obviously is GPS triggered it's not a major stretch for them to add audio so for those Reasons I'm out okay thanks Mark I keep measuring the words 15,000 sub subscribers 15,000 against I'd like $1 million it just sounds to me like it's crazy I'm out thanks Barbara you know I think it's really cool while you are very credible a million doll for 5% that just doesn't excite me so unfortunately I'll be a customer but I'm out yeah Woody I think uh fantastic idea if it was really early I take a flyer on it cuz you never know I don't think consumers will pay for it I think if it was a feature I got with something else absolutely immersive I would use it so I think where you are at this stage just not for me I not okay thanks Robert so you said that the annual fee was how much again 36 for one year and $70 do you know what your customer acquisition cost is yet the average since launch is $38 um but in the most recent month it was under 10 we're starting to get more and more word of mouth we won the Webby Award for best travel app so you think you can hold it down at 10 yeah $9 and change you know I got to tell you I thought it was insane when you walked in here but um you're very credible there's no question about it it's intriguing I like it I'm going to give you the million bucks but I want 15% wow here's something else Woody anything to do with money any Bank building any Federal Reserve I'll narrate [Music] it I mean look I have millions of followers tell me so you know you you have followers that's obviously great for adding subscribers are there other places where you see the you add value yeah there is everybody returns my calls everybody you tell me what door you need open and I'll make it happen I appreciate the offer I am willing to go up as high as 62% for that million dollar but 15 is that's that's way too high I'll do it at 12 seven it's got to be 10 or ain't going to happen I can't get above seven why that's the about I'm already giving 7 plus 3% advisory shares those were those are going to be advisory sh that's how I'm going to get above the five is to give you advisory shares well get me to 10 we're done I can't get you at the I can't get you at that price Kevin you're throwing all his investors under the bus I'm Mr Wonderful you're already getting a huge discount you're going to be in at a much better price than those folks it's not my fault that the cap tables the way way it is okay y I was willing you know to do it 15 and you talked me down you beat me down to 10% I want you to be excited about this and be happy to jump in the mission I am if you tell me done at 10% I'm very excited I'm sorry can't do 10% uh Woody good for you Woody for

so in front of you you'll notice we gave you a couple of chubby buttons units it Bluetooth connects to my phone it sure does Barbara you know you're the queen skier of the group so we would love if you could put on those gloves we gave you yes so it's actually already hooked up to my phone right here so let's say we're about to you know start skiing down the mountain and you know we got some some tunes playing right oh yeah right now this song's good but could be a little better maybe you can hit the plus button increase the volume yeah a little louder yeah go Shake It Up Barb exactly and you can press play again all right so let's just say that you know you're listening to music just like that we can control all the media from your smartphone or you can pick up phone calls you can decline phone calls it was very easy to work and you can do nothing in a ski glove honestly people on the mount are always taking a ski glove off all day long yeah that's that's how we started the company we've been best friends since we were 13 we went to high school together and every year we do a trip somewhere and one year we went on a ski trip to Colorado and I was listening to music the problem was this whole Fiasco that I presented here actually happened in real time at at a certain point I said Justin I just wish there was a big fat button I could use to control my phone and we kind of looked at each other and our gears started going and we we kind of thought that big fat buttons may not have been the best marketing word for this so we molded around a little bit ended up with chubby butts chubby better essentially that how long has it been in the market we've been actively selling for 3 years what are lifetime sales so in 2021 we brought in 500,000 of Topline Revenue wow in 20122 we brought in 600,000 in Topline revenue and what do you sell them for and what do they cost you to make so it's about 1157 and 1337 landed and we sell them for $79.99 Wow $79.99 83% margin and what percentage of your sales the5 to $600,000 you spending on marketing yeah we do spend about between 12 and $155,000 per month customer acquisition cost $26.86 per year what's the biggest application for the product is it skiing so when we created it it was mainly for skiers and snowboarders but we had no idea that all these other people wanted to use it motorcyclists Pilots uh boxers corers yeah Sailors too they bring it on their boat and they' heere it CU they're busy with Roes and fisherman waterproof you take it into the shower people adhered to their jet skis and so guys the simple story of this product you you make it and your customer acquisition costs combined are 40 bucks you sell it for 80 bucks you make $40 of contribution that's basically what's going on here you take that you buy more inventory right you haven't taken any money out of the business yet no so we have one investor right now how much did he put in so $250,000 was the initial investment guys I'll clear the deck some look I think there's a real risk from voice automated products like Alexa headphones or Google headphones it's just not a fit for me so for those Reasons I'm out it's nothing I could help with honestly it's not for me I'm out look guys I don't know if it's going to survive long term cuz I do think airpods are getting more sophisticated I I mean I just see a technical obsolescence to it but I wish you all the best I'm out that's fine thank you so much you're really nice guys I mean honestly like you have so much fun up there I can see that your relationship is really wonderful and I think it's really smart product thank you no I'm not super techy person I know enough but I just I I can't predict like what's going to be the next thing how soon I'm sorry I'm out well listen it's such a simple product I like it here's an offro right I'll give you the 250,000 I want 10% I want a royalty of course but I'm not that great okay I'm going to take 10 bucks a unit till I get back a million bucks I get 3x on my money and then we ride off into the sunset hoping that this product turns into a company CU I'm hoping you guys come up with some other ideas we do make once all is said and done about $12 per unit so it's about a 15% you cannot we can't do a $10 royalty it's a lot much you can counter the royalty is uh is a little steep for us I think that we wouldn't mind doing a $2 royalty ooh could you really afford that B I will be 178 years old when I get paid back 278 Kevin we have six we we have a couple of thousand units in stock with your help we're making more we're making about 16,500 units it's not a company yet it's a product it's a good product I could see using it I mean all of those things are great but it's got to be a $10 royalty yeah it's a little tight Kevin you're going to bankrupt them at $10 a un your customer acquisition cost is likely to go down now that you're on Shark Tank yes and so that's what I'm betting on that you'll be able to you can afford to pay me back it's not my fault that you ask me for a quar of a million dollars for basically you know a nice little product but that's a lot of money quick question instead of a royalty that you described if we were to have a higher Equity portion for you would that be something that would no because the reason you want me to get a royalty I know this may sound crazy to you but our incentives are aligned I want you to sell more units it is but Kevin why wouldn't you go up in in the percentage it's always interesting to hear this on the other sides but they're not writing checks actually saying no checks no checks no checks so look it's okay if you don't take it tomorrow morning when I wake up I'll still be Mr Wonderful right now unfortunately would you go down to a $3 royalty no okay you're not selling enough units well with your help imagine we can be selling a lot more well I'm I'm hoping that's the case cuz i' like to get back my$ 250 you also like to be part of the business for longer than it takes to sell us out of business once I put it in my portfolio my team goes to work what do you think I do I try and think of all the companies over the years I sold I forbid you to give him royalty like that we'd like to counter by offering 15% for 250 as an equity we want to raise it to compensate for you and um a royalty of $1 per unit until you make your investment back no thanks guys thank you appreciate it thank you sharks thank you sharks strong stuff strong stuff I think we did our best we could I think we really explained what our product was as clearly as we could to everybody they recognize the value I just think it's unfortunately I think they're missing out on an opportunity that for a great great company ", "Crispy Cones": "first in the tank is a decadent twist to a favorite sweet [Music] treat hi sharks my name is Jeremy Carlson and I'm Caitlyn Carlson we are here seeking $200,000 for 10% Equity of our company crispy cones sharks for years we've been eating ice cream cream out of this boring ice cream is royalty in the dessert Kingdom it deserves to be treated as such and you shouldn't eat her Frozen Majesty the queen of sweets out of this crumbly cardboard coffin barf that's why I revolutionized the soft Sur cone with Crispy cones freshly made dough cones grilled rotisserie style covered in cinnamon sugar and cookie powder finally a cone fit for Queen at all of our crispy cones locations we cook our doughy Krispy cones on our specialty grill fresh to order oh yeah look at that wow and then we powder them to your liking you then choose a spread like hazelnut chocolate cookie butter Gourmet soft serve ice cream a topping of choice and what sauce to drizzle on top oh yeah Barbara are you drilling yet I'm drooling so sharks who's ready to give ice cream the proper Throne it deserves with Crispy cones when can we start right now take in sharks so you have a full crispy cone with a spread on the inside and then ice cream and then the cone next to it should be a warm cone with a spread on the inside incredible wow so it's almost a donut we don't mark it as a donut and it's not fried it's not fried it's not fried fried it's not fried we put it on those Dows right there on the grill and then they grill with heat rotisserie style caramelizing the sugar look at this delicious I know we made that just special for you Barbara so we know it's good it looks good it tastes good it feels good it's creamy it's smooth it's tasty but how tasty is the business the business is super tasty just like that cone I started this company on the side of the road in a tent I had no money I was a freshman at College the first year we made $21,000 how long ago is this so this was in 2018 and we were only open 4 months the second year I designed a trailer in China and got it shipped here and we made or we grossed 70 $7,000 that second year out of a trailer out of a trailer in just 5mon period and then the third year was Co year we were devastated school was out colleges went out but we grossed $80,000 that year out of the same trailer out of the same trailer in the same small town and then in 2021 we gross $27,000 and then this year we're projected to have half a million doll out of a trailer so we ended up selling that trailer cuz we grew out of it we had an opportunity to open up a storefront in Logan Utah and then we had an opportunity to open up a storefront in Rexburg Idaho this year so now we have two fulltime St why would you do that when things are going so well with the low overhead we basically just grew out of the trailer and we knew that if we wanted to scale this business that we couldn't do what we wanted to do in the trailer I'm just curious we don't know what one cost so it costs us to make .50 roughly to $89 then we sell it for $759 it's roughly a 38% markup yeah but it seems worth it I mean G it's high quality ingredient how did you come up with this idea yeah so I actually served a mission for my church for 2 years in the Czech Republic and they would make these pastry type things on the side of the road and I was fascinated by it and by the end of my 2 years I literally had a dream in the middle of the night of me making these in the US so I brought it back and I learned in my aunt's kitchen I figured out the recipe I flew back to the Czech Republic to perfect it did you see them cooking it on a rotisserie or did you come up with that um they hand make them in the Czech Republic they put them over coal so takes so much longer and you can't do that inside a storefront and Caitlyn what's your story so I was Jeremy's employee he hired me in 2019 I married my employee I have a background in photography I do wedding photography and um social media marketing and stuff so he reached out to me just on Instagram we didn't know each other and asked if I would help him run the Instagram so you slid into a you married your stalker yeah yeah and honestly it's been the best like we're so in love and it's been like the biggest blessing to like grow this business together okay so now you're a retail business tell us about each location how many square feet and what are the sales per location yeah so the first storefront that we opened was in Logan Utah it's 1,400 Square ft we were able to open it with a budget including equipment $90,000 for buildout and equipment and then we opened up the storefront in Rexburg which is, 1600 sare ft and um it cost us about roughly $150,000 of the sales for the first store so Logan Utah just barely hit um a year mark in August 27th and they did $298,000 gross and did you make money on that store we did not and that is industry standard especially in the food industry I'm assuming you're going to want to franchise this one day so that if I as a franchisee want to buy it I'd like to make you know 50 to 880,000 a year cost so what what does a store have to produce for me to make that so roughly $300,000 and we have a list of 11 people who are opening up 11 different stores in a year and a half you already have the franchisees the franchisees we've interviewed we've done our due diligence for the past 5 months with them and today our first franchisees is signing their first agreement in Arizona it's going to be three stores in a year and a half do they pay you to get the franchisee first store is $30,000 the next two are $25,000 we have nailed the product I I know the importance of nailing it and then scaling it and not going to fast you don't have the numbers yet to sell it to you said you had 298,000 was your production and you said you needed to have a store roughly make $300,000 to make any money right so what happened there we've paid roughly $51,000 in attorney fees just to become a franchise company so they haven't really proven it out so where have you raised your money who's put money into this so far I I drove lift and over and I grinded so much to kind of pay for those things as well as we were able to pull out an SBA loan and then we do have a line of credit open so how longge is that line of credit it's $190,000 look um you're not in the ice cream business anymore you're in the franchise business and that's a completely different set of respons abilities it's requiring training and understanding that managing people dealing with the expectations of franchisees and so I don't think you have enough experience yet to get into franchising I think you're too early to do that that you still should develop and grow organically with your own stores so for those Reasons I'm out look really impressive what you've done for me you're moving too quickly when you take a franchisees money it's a commitment to them and make makes me nervous without having a proven model on the store I mean you might get there but it's not for me I'm out thank you so much guys I love the business a lot while it was in the truck I I thought you know 400 500 square ft and this nonproprietary dut cone which anybody can do themselves means you have to run like crazy with this somebody like Barbara is going to come and say I can do this and I can do it in a much faster better way so uh I loved it the way it started in your dream you're you're in a truck but anyways I'm out thank you so much it's insanely delicious it is better to me than any donut or croissant or anything that I've ever had actually I think you an amazing job I personally think the franchise model is not the way to go with this for that reason I wish you good luck but I'm out thank you all right so one shark left [Music] Barbara there are some other things that we are doing with our company differently where we create a hype as well as scaling every week we drop a new specialty flavor that's homemade in our store like French toast Blackberry Huckleberry and people go crazy over we have people waiting at the doors something that cousins main lobster does and very effectively all the time right all right I'm very interested in this business and I am the person that knows more about franchise totally than anybody here all right I'm going to make you an offer I am the person that knows more about franchise and F than anybody here all right I'm going to make you an offer I'd like 20% for the 200,000 and I should really charge you 50% the truth be known because I know so much about it know the pitfalls know the organizational systems I know the attorneys I know it all would you go $200,000 for 15% oh definitely not I'm giving you great deal oh you know it should be painful it should be both sides feel they're not getting a great deal she wants more she said 50% and you're howling at the moon at 20 this should be a great partnership as Kevin often says all roads lead back to Barbara that never happens I believe that it's a dead end oh my God Barbara would you do $200,000 for 177% no what's the difference of 3% I've just worked so hard for this and listen I bought 30% of cousins main lobster business it was my idea to franchise it I was the one who told them they could make much more of a profit on a truck than they could on a restaurant experience is the one thing you guys don't have that's correct 3% is nothing if you're going to be success sit here another minute I'm going to have to Fara we'll take your offer okay good wow you go Bara with this whole time thank you so much my pleasure can I give you a hug like I've been watching you for so many years thank you so much I was 12 when I started watching all of you so all of you have been Idols to me Barbara's been the main Idol though oh [Music] you like I can't believe you bar oh my gosh that's exactly what we wanted that's what we came for she's such an amazing person um human and she'll be perfect for our company we just know it we're excited we're super excited ", "Tngnt Ski Bikes": "next up is an innovation in winter [Music] sports hi sharks I'm Scott and I'm Bill we're from Salt Lake City Utah and we're here seeking $200,000 for 20% equity in our company sharks bill and I are both Avid mountain bikers and for us there's nothing better than a summer morning riding our favorite Trails the only problem is once the snow falls we have to put our bikes away don't get us wrong we love skiing what's better than a batch of fresh powder so what if you could take the best from both of these Sports and combine them into a single product that is both easy to learn and outrageously fun oo well guess what sharks we've done it introducing tangent ski bikes oh that is cool how safe it looks dangerous that's why I love it check these things out we've carved out a new way to hit the slopes our combination of a high performance design and traditional bicycle parts gives outdoor enthusiasts something that has never been available before and in addition sharks ski biking is easy to learn if you can ride a bike you can ride a ski bike cool our ski bikes are gravity powered and currently enjoyed by people of all ages and all abilities so sharks who wants to come and Shred with us and start the next revolution in winter sports cool so so when did you first create this is this brand new or is this something you've been selling for a while so we actually started about 7 years ago in product development and started shipping product about six years ago I've never seen one on a sko that's why we're here so why don't you get to sales in we' had six years get right to the numbers so um lifetime sales half a million dollar last year was really our breakout year we did $175,000 this year we'll do 250,000 how many units is that we did about 200 units last year tell me about the product so when you sell me the bike you're selling me everything I see there exactly everything you see there how do I stop very similar to riding uh snowboard or skis you simply lean to the side and the skis have metal you're able to stop you wouldn't believe how much control there is now when snowboards came out they were banned on many mountains all around the world because of all the accidents so where does this fit in that Continuum have you been banned already we are making continuous progress you guys there's a group out there called American ski bike Association and their sole responsibility is to go Advocate the sport of ski biking but wait wait wait if there's a ski biking Association that means there's other products that are similar there there are some similar products there are yeah and so let me just finish about Point currently in the United States there are over 120 Resorts that welcome ski bikes and worldwide there's over 200 more so what percentage ban them half of them um less than half far less than half you said there's an association and that there's competitive product why is yours different or better than the other one there's really two competitors on the market number one there's a custom frame Builder so they're like four to $6,000 off they're not M they're one off the other competitor is closer to us but he doesn't have the proprietary tangent ski return and what is the operational like riding difference between yours and that one one of the things that we have patent is called our ski retention system what it does is it keeps the ski in contact with the ground does it detach on a fall like does not detach on a no what do you sell them for okay we have two models actually our entry point is the tangent drift it's the orange one and that one retails for $9.99 um the red one that's our tangent carve it's $15.49 what's the difference full suspension front suspension what's your cost to make that one so at 458 is our cost landed in our warehouse and on the the higher end model uh 594 everybody would like to try it before they buy it absolutely but that requires capital for you to provide 20 30 40 50 units for each Hill that's part of our strategy we grow our network of on Mountain Rentals because like Scott said when we get people on the bike they buy the bike you've sold 200 you said last year year why do you think you're not selling more it's new it's not that new and there's other competitors that are trying to do the same right are you full-time bill and I are currently not full-time so I am a data security engineer and I'm a mechanical engineer bill bill is a rocket science this is more of a hobby for you I mean 200 units is transition I'm sorry Mr wonder I'm going to argue that point because by the time I get off my day job this is a full-time job it's a job I don't get paid for we're not taking any money from the company we are doing this to to grow this this is our passion how big are the other competitors the custom frame Builders way smaller and the other companies about the same as us and none of them seem to be growing at like a boob rate right it's just kind of piddling along why right well imagine 10 years from now that this is in the Olympics guys guys guys you're doing too much imagining every opor needs to have Vision right but there's got to be a dose of reality why is there an association if there's three of you there's no numbers on it nobody's divulging there's no public companies but there's still not enough if they're the same size as you that means 400 500 units we totally agree so come on you guys come on with us I don't know that any of us solve that problem okay my suggestion to you first is call all of them instead of working against each other you work together because if you can build a pie you all will grow it's such a nent tiny market right now I just don't see it as a fit for me so for those Reasons I'm out guys TNG NT does not say tangent it's t like I I mean my son loves math and he's like Hey Dad it's like a tangent off of bicycling and skiing let's call it tangent and then the next kid said let's do it without vowels what's the logo supposed to be a fish it's two G's back to back I think it really sucks all right it actually looks great on a cap they letters that you can't remember when you can't remember it it doesn't quite say it I just think it's terrible but okay but most most ski areas today have quad chairs that accommodate like five skiers this takes away too much revenue from the ski slope because it takes up two spots every time you go up the mountain and frankly I think you have a bigger issue getting adopted by the mountains themselves I'm out all right guys it has Merit but this tant thing is bothering me I don't know just it's interesting and I could make things happen but the little Mr Wonderful on this is Guy saying what are you an idiot you'll spend all day working on this it's actually one of those deals I could have gone either way but go that way I know come our way sorry guys I I I'm out listen I'm sure it would be fun it looks cool but you haven't sold a ton nor has your competition the Market's spoken and I listen to that yeah you guys are wonderful but unfortunately I just don't have confidence in it as an investment I'm out so sometimes you got to give the consumer what they want and you've got to read the market and sometimes you got to create a category and people don't know they want it until they have it exactly my view of this is super cool I want to get on it right away I mean if it goes fast I'm going to try it but the challenge I think it's getting other people to think it's cool so I I have a good friend of mine it's an Olympic gold medalist in winter sports and and I think you need somebody of that stature to say yeah I think this is cool so I'm going to make you an offer what I wanted to offer was 200,000 for 40% and I was going to give half that equity and see if we could bring him in on it he doesn't want to paid he doesn't want to license it it's Shawn White it's not contingent Shan white coming in I'd love us to pitch it to him but my offer is to 200,000 for 40% and I think we need to bring somebody into it hopefully Sean or somebody of that level you have an offer can we chat for like 3 seconds is that okay he's going to change his mind W I think you're going to get it you have to validate the sport all right Robert would you consider 30% for 200,000 no no I I knew you were going to do that I'm not going to negotiate that offer that's the number I need Robert welcome to the tangent family horrible logo horrible logo we got to change we can talk about that for sure 40% thank you so thank youg guys a great job guys his check very quickly I can't believe this man now we got to deal with Robert that aw oh my God my oh my gosh we knew we needed the muscle of a of a shark like Robert to help us take this to the next level we've been working on this for 6 years and really that resource for us is going to be invaluable in expanding tangent or whatever we Rebrand to you do have to change the logo the logo sucks you know you're on the hill they say what is that you say it's a cantic Kevin you look like you're on your rocking horse Kink it can [Music] it ", "Bleni Blends": "thank you next in the tank is an innovation in healthy Vending [Music] hi sharks I'm Peter Shapiro and I'm Stuart Shapiro and we're based in Havertown Pennsylvania and if you can't tell already we're brothers clearly good teams running our family very attractive thank you man we're here today seeking 250

made from oat milk real coffee this is really amazing yeah it's very sweet what does it have just regular sugar in that one I love it it's a real thing there's no added sugar in the Mango Tropical no in the fruits we have no attitude that is awesome wow thank you you guys brushes it for yourself or you buy the pouches so they're proprietary Blends they're aseptically packaged in bags so they're actually shelf stable we have manufacturers we have three facilities United States that package it for us but we didn't want something that's refrigerated we didn't want something it was frozen how long you've been doing this so where are you guys from and you put this together I'll tell you about this so we both have business backgrounds we grew up near Philadelphia we really wanted to go out and be entrepreneurs so we got into real estate and one day I just kind of was looking on I was like oh my God there's this whole new world of unattended retail that hasn't been tapped it and that's when Peter called me late the night I was like I found it so we were introduced to this product we ended up flying up to Canada seeing a prototype within a few weeks we had negotiated for the exclusive rights uh to the us so you guys are a licensee with exclusive rights only to the United States correct for the for the life of the pack and how many years are left on the patent 15. 15 Lots so you already have them in place what's your busiest one what are your revenues how much does each of them produce so we have 41 of these out in the market we have 20 more in our warehouse that just got delivered so what's your most prolific of your 41 how many does it make a day so it does about 8 000 a month wow yes we can either have our team they'll actually run it day to day and we own the machine then we have a program where we sell that machine to the location then they buy the fruit from us and in perpetually like you always like this wonderful world we're making money buy the fruit because it's packaged in a proprietary we own the entire supply chain what does one smoothie cost five dollars 25 cents on average on average uh the cost of goods sold is Blended a dollar forty okay so five bucks basically cost you guys a buck 40 but then you've got either commission that you're paying to the host tell us about the economics maintenance clause and Personnel right now typically a large Food Service Company will come to us we give them 15 for them to take care of it elaborate on that like you mean an Aramark or a series you already do we already do in 2021 what were your revenues and your profit so we started in 2020 we did ten thousand dollars 2021 we did 275 000 and then year to date it was 465 000. we're on track to be at least one and a half million nice growth we're here we've put all the money into it we've been purchasing all the machines ourselves yes so each machine costs uh nineteen thousand five hundred and then we sell it for 30. so when we actually sell it we're looking had a profit of 35. so is my money getting tied up in the capex of the machines because you're asking me for 250 000 for six percent all right routines and more machines so you actually manufacture them I mean the person that owns the patent is overseas and they're handling manufacturing right now we also added it into our contract at any point we can buy the all the IP and the patent and then bring manufacturing somewhere else okay what is that price four million dollars whoa guys have any performance requirements where you've got to buy X number of units or you lose it correct yeah what are those so for this year we up to 80 machines which we've already ordered and done uh then I do a hundred more for the following year so 81 year 100 the next year 120 the following 120 following is there a point where there's a cap on it and you don't have to hit that anymore currently we don't have a cap in there because our goal would be to get that IP we want to keep the blenny brand that's what we're really growing we want to become a brand that everyone knows all right guys look what I don't like about this deal for me is the capex on the machines the nineteen thousand if there was a way that I could invest in the bags that's interesting but the curse of this is the capex on the machines and for that reason I'm out you know we have everything in in this um Stuart has sold his house and he lives in my house still and I personally have put 1.2 million wow we've sold all that real estate are you taking salary no we're not taking salaries all right guys my general thoughts is I think this is brilliant the stuff tastes amazing but the fact that you are actually using another person's product where things happen you may not hit those numbers you're not in control of that this is heavy cash intensive as well I don't know if I'm that comfortable with you having a license from somebody else so with that I'm out thank you guys I get pitched self-service food this or that every single day there's huge amount of risk in terms of technological obsolescence something better comes along you're still stuck that's really scary for me as an investor so for those Reasons I'm out thank you Mark so listen Guys these were phenomenal like honestly phenomenal I was talking with my fellow shark Daniel who you know he happens to know quite a bit about the entire food for me it's going to be a very Sharky offer because I'm very concerned about this it's just gonna require from my team a ton of investment to help you so I would only do this for 35 percent of the country wow it's not the money I'm gonna put in millions of dollars of my team's time and my time well all of our years of expertise and connections it's gonna cost something right and I would like to do it with Daniel I think it will cost to have Partners like this so 250 000 for 35 you get two sharks what do you guys say [Music] realize that Stuart and I can put in the grip I promise you would you do the deal for 15 no way no I wouldn't do it for 34 I'm telling you guys this is gonna be it's a firm deal it's 35 it's not that I'm gonna be a tough person it's just I I know this is going to be so much work you've got to make a decision I think 35 is a lot to ask for having already put it real quick we've done this I think 35 is a lot to ask can you come down at all from 35 I mean I think that's I can't because it's just going to be determine would you do it no I agree because I think the two of them together any chance you're doing a deal for 35 yes or no foreign with a 500 000 line of credit million dollar line of credit no so we do 35 for 250 000 and subject to us confirming that everything you said is as it is we'll give you a 500 000 line of credit I'm good with that thank you [Music] the two of you are our dreams we love we love you we love everything we gave away 35 which was a lot more than we intended to but we understand uh you know like the famous line that Mark always says you had to have a little bit of a watermelon than just 100 of the grape wait you're not subscribed to the Shark Tank Youtube channel well then for that reason I'm out ", "Happi Floss": "next up is a product that is good for your body and the planet hi sharks my name is Dr Stacy Whitman I'm a board certified pediatric dentist from Portland Oregon and I'm here today seeking two hundred thousand dollars for 10 Equity of my company no sharks with millions of people seeing your beautiful smiles every week I'm sure you've lost it daily and you should because cavities and gum disease are two of the most chronic diseases globally well are you ready for me to drop some more truth bombs [Music] oh my God [Music] starts this is only 3 000 flossers repurposed from my dental office if you use single-use plastic every day to floss your teeth you will create nearly thirty thousand pieces of trash in your lifetime that's 10 times this amount now plastic classrooms will take nearly 400 years or more to break down if they ever do potentially releasing Plastics microtoxins and microplastics into our soil oceans and eventually our bodies sharks say goodbye to petroleum-based Plastics and say hello to happy Foss happy floss is the world's first flosser designed for True compost ability it's made of layers of post-consumer recycled paper making it biodegradable breaking down in under one year no toxins no microplacets just clean soil it's good for you and it's good for our planet so who's with me sharks who wants to help me create happier teeth and a healthier Planet together in front of you are your own flossers to check out and get to Flossin so this is like the ones that we all know we see in the store yours is really very very similar but it's paper correct so most floss picks right now are made of petroleum-based plastics and I'm sure you've read about microplastics being found now in our blood in our soil in our water how do you come up with this idea so I was at a dental conference in Hawaii and I was walking to the conference and I was shocked as I walked along the marina in the shore with how much trash was in the on the Shrine in the ocean and as I look closer I noticed all these plastic flossers and I had this Epiphany because I encourage parents of small children to use floss picks because it's so much easier than using string the oral healthcare industry it's a five billion dollar industry flossers make up about a half a billion dollars of that so when I saw those slossers in Hawaii and I paired that with me telling parents you need to floss your kids teeth and I'm in Portland Oregon where people are very conscientious about the environment parents would come into me and say nope we're not flossing I can't use the string and I'm not using plastic flossers no thank you and I'd say wait you're gonna your child might get cavities here you know so they felt that strongly against flossing their children's teeth because of plastic I mean and then it kills me every time I put one of these these into the trash can with my own kids like I want to buy this I want to be here and I and I hear this struggle is the Machinery it is manufacturing because this has never been made before and that's why I'm here is because I know what poll you have and I want to party let me let me drill down on something here let's say we all agree on the Merit of the project okay I learned when I was graduating I did my project on the dental business for dental Cabinetry in North America that's what my thesis was on and I learned that all the dental equipment in your office is controlled by three Behemoth companies including distribution of everything you use why wouldn't you take this idea to any one of those three and you license it to them how could you possibly make money selling these things one at a time to a system that's already pre-established well the margins can be up to 50 on floss picks actually but how are you gonna sell it direct directions you're not selling it yet I'm not selling it yet these have all been handmade and so I am here to try to get manufacturing going to get these ones why would you want to manufacture it when it has a good point do you have a patent I had a utility patents pending in the U.S Europe and Canada but they're pending so what's the likelihood of you getting those Brands very high so the biggest competitor is humbleco if you've seen them they they are taking over the market so how are you going to compete against them you I need you guys to help me and that's why I'm here with all due respect we do have full-time day jobs we need to rely on the entrepreneur and then we can Empower them without them but you tell I just want to summarize the story you're telling us I don't have a product out in the market I have a fierce competitor I haven't sold one cent but I'm worth two million dollars and you're gonna help me do everything well I do a pre-sale so we did a crowdfunding last year and I've done pre-sales through my office also um about a hundred thousand dollars to date okay so what are you selling these for for so we started at 12.99 for a 30 pack which is very high so it's crazy we know when manufacturing happens that we will get the price point down I'm not even entertaining going to a manufacturer that already does this I you don't know the three suppliers they're not interested in this this is a consumer product this will be a direct to Consumer products I totally disagree with you I mean my goodness I I can't even imagine you going into the manufacturing of dental floss I mean that's like a joke and for that reason I'm out so your heart is in the right place you're caring about the environment is in the right place what you don't know is to go ahead and manufacture these requires a person to be running that business full-time and you know doing so many things that you don't know anything about not to say you couldn't figure it out but I have to say I agree with Kevin it would be a much better route for you and much easier to give it to somebody who's in that space already and you'll get a royalty so for me there's nothing to invest in at this moment I wish you good luck but I'm out thank you Dr Whitman like you always said that your heart is in the right place and you want to solve several issues I I really really applaud that but I don't think this business is the best at all at this moment I'm for that reason thank you well I think that uh you would be using my money for tuition right now I would have to try to take 50 of the company and then all of a sudden I will be figuring out with you and then we figure out maybe it's not going where you want to go and now I own 50 of your dream or in a certain amount of time at your pace because you got a day job you'll figure out those answers it's just a little too early at the moment so I'm out hey Stacy you have one shark left Stacy every entrepreneur has different types of challenges and in your particular case business is not your background you've got the which is admirable you've got the brain power to figure out how to get there but you don't have any of the business chops at all and that makes you completely dependent on somebody else and I just don't think I can overcome those issues for you so for that reason I'm out good luck good luck I didn't get a deal but I still look at it as a success because I gained so much information and advice from the Sharks and I'm spreading the message about the importance of oral health and the importance of sustainability in the oral Healthcare market so I consider to win I recently found out I'm predisposed of periodontal disease and now I've gone into a program of getting my teeth cleaned every single three weeks that's how you avoid it oh Kevin as a vampire you can't operate without your teeth ", "LavaBox Portable Campfires": "first in the tank is a way to bring humankind's greatest discovery with you anywhere hello sharks my name is Josh Thurman I'm CEO Chief eruption officer for laubox portable campfires I'm here today seeking two hundred thousand dollars for 10 equity in my world saving products sharks you must have some Primal desires we can't always control very well one of those Primal desires the desire to build fires specifically campfires now we all love a good campfire but the devastation created by human cause wildfires is heartbreaking oftentimes totally preventable so I set out to create something that would be clean easy to use and would keep us safe something we can drink a beer around or why Mr Wonderful and tell a great story that's why I created lava box now normally we would never light loud box indoors this is Shark Tank let's fire this baby up laughs so loud box is deceptively simple it starts with a military style ammo can you just pop the top that right there check the propane light the lighter that we provide and then slowly turn on the gas you guys ready all right here we go there it is pretty cool so it can go from Kumbaya all the way to heavy metal fire all right let's turn it down all right so about a foot out of the box is actually the perfect level for roasting marshmallows for s'mores this is also what everybody asked me Josh can you cook on it and the answers are resounding you betcha so you can lift the lava box up to pass fire restrictions or close up the legs pop it on top and now you're ready for tailgating burgers at the same that's cool sharks I think I've created the perfect grab-and-go solution for a very modern problem so the question is who's going to gather on the lava box and get lit with me baby check out what I've got in front of you these are actually custom we do a lot of custom work it's very Hardy this is actually the lightest product on the market right now with the biggest fire so in the bag is our goodie bag and you get all the things you need so you get the actual regulator and hose everything but the propane everything with propane so you have three sizes so there's like a small medium and large correct and this is small the size that's our small one and then they sell what's the most popular one that's the most popular and it's actually called the takana twosome it comes with the over under Grill retails for 195 and it's about 29 landed for me so I have a question I mean obviously I'm assuming guessing you're a big camper but tell us about you what's your background sure and why did you come up with this so uh I just left my job a few months ago I was uh the program director at the National Sports Center for the disabled and I teach all kinds of sports for people with disabilities and uh my whole life has been about service so yeah I um designed this I sit on the board for the Colorado Whitewater Association we had a camping trip and somebody said hey uh I'm a big Tinker I make all kinds of cool stuff including adaptive equipment I said make some that's not so cumbersome something that's not massive that I'm gonna put into a wrap because you guys have seen the big portable fire pits and the Rocks go everywhere and it's a big mess I went home I built seven prototypes and uh sevens was the best one put it out on the market I sold 40 in a week and I knew I had something oh yeah now we've done now we've done it's a great example for entrepreneurs you know you figure it out you do multiple versions of a prototype you keep on testing and iterating thank you yeah you put them out there see if people buy them I want to hear the numbers we've been open for about 18 months it's a date for this year we're about 610 and that's are you profitable very profitable so we're at 290. all right what will be your sales this year I think we're gonna do 1.2 wow are you selling only Direct online or are you selling through retailers direct consumer has been huge for us and actually my spend has been really low I think because it's been

thank you thank you another question tell me what is the most important thing to you in a partner I think I've done a lot of the heavy lifting it's going to be an easy partnership on that side I do want somebody I can call and say should I make this call or should I make this call okay I like this product and I like the big box idea I think because this has hanger appeal you walk in a big box generally you have two or three type of grills right the egg the this one and then that one right and I think this has like that moment like wait a minute honey I miss seeing this ever I have an offer I think this is a licensing play Big Box 200 000 and I'll match Kevin's twenty percent foreign I think you don't need to be in a ton of retail stores but Bass Pro and camping world I mean it's why not

they do this they call me All Around the Clock I'll give you the 200 000 for 15 okay but I would like to get a royalty 75 cents per until I'm paid back the 200 then the royalty will go away okay and

you Josh I'll do the 200 000 for 10 no royalty hello here's what I will say I think you have to go with your gut and you go away that's wonderful Josh and I offered you exactly what you wanted and none of this disgusting royalty you want to do a deal with a person that never goes camping I am Mr Camp absolutely well here's the thing I'm successful I believe because I trust my gut and I go for things with conviction I went to the 12 and a half percent but I hope that you'd be that person that knows in your gut if I'm the right partner you don't have to and even pay royalties that's just would you do 50 cents so 75 cents is really low I'm your girl you want to step over dollars to save pennies no don't do it no but I know you got a deal okay good everybody no congratulations to you Josh so I would have been happy with whoever I got from the the Sharks but I was really happy to get Lori that's who I wanted coming in and uh is the right fit for me with my small product plus she's really good at marketing and that's what I needed", "The Ice Cream Canteen": "next up is a way to carry America's favorite dessert on the go [Music] hi sharks my name is Jordan and I'm here today asking for one hundred thousand dollars in exchange for five percent equity in my company the ice cream canteen [Music] sharks this is the pint of ice cream this the most delicious and most popular dessert in the country the problem is ice cream melts so quickly that you can't take this anywhere that's why I created the ice cream canteen the world's first double walled vacuum inside a container for the pint of ice cream so you can keep your ice cream cold and enjoy ice cream anywhere [Music] just drop in your favorite ice cream screw on the cap and the ice cream canteen will keep it frozen for hours no freezer no problem if it sounds too good to be true let's put it to a test sure [Music] let's go ahead and get our safety gear on okay [Music] so I would like you to do your best to melt this pint of ice cream are you ready I'm ready all right nuke it you're wonderful [Laughter] [Music] all right get in there Mark it's not it's not gonna melt itself off [Music] [Laughter] all right we're gonna burn the table step hang on back for a second [Music] all right already at 425 degrees wow all right thanks Mark let's check it out let's see how we're doing let's see if we got some ice cream oh my gosh open okay that is very hot but we still have an ice cold Frozen pint of ice cream wow easy as you can see the ice cream canteen stands up to the Heat and what that means is that now ice cream can be enjoyed at the beach at picnics barbecues or birthday parties or really anywhere so sharks don't let this deal Melt Away Jordan I want to ask a couple guys first of all I think you're solving a huge need this seems genius I love the idea how long will it last before it melts and also do you need to freeze the container beforehand so the ice cream canteen does not need to be pre-chilled it works a little better if you do pre-show but it's not necessary the ice cream canteen will keep it frozen for up to four hours on its own or if you put it in a cooler with other food drinks it'll work for up to eight hours nobody come up with it before no one came up with that before me uh that is the way you 've said no one came up with it me what did they do after you if I came here two months ago I would have been able to say I was the very only ice cream canteen on the market as of the last two months I have had two very much inferior but similar products come to Market do you have a patent I do I still have a design pattern that's still pending and I have three registered trademarks break down the numbers tell us what you sell them for what they cost you to make I sell the ice cream canteen right now for 44.99 oh wow and what's your cost to make it my Landing cost is 7.50 well there you go that's good margins I'll direct a consumer no not all direct consumer I think the huge potential here is retail and one of my largest Retail Partners right now is the ice cream industry so we look across the country there's 80 000 ice cream gelato or frozen yogurt shops in the country they all sell pints of ice cream but customers cannot take that pint of ice cream from the store to their home from their store to the beach Jordan what's your uh Revenue I sold 98 000 in 2021. how about this year and this year uh sales are going great I've done 185 000 a day so you should have made a boatload of money off of that what were your profits I'm netting over 50 right now so you've put in 99 000 give or take in your pocket already correct yeah this year we're expected to do over 400 000 in revenue and net over fifty percent that's awesome that's how much of your own money have you put into this to get started I was fifteen thousand dollars uh in credit card debt and what do you need more than anything more than anything right now I am Capital constrained and I'm having to leave a lot of opportunities on the table because I don't have the inventory and I don't have the money to purchase large purchase orders so listen you need a hundred thousand dollars basically for inventory that's your you don't have enough product all right I like this deal it's very simple to understand I'll give you the hundred thousand dollars on thirty percent I think you're worth two million bucks but I think you've got a really interesting idea and the chef wonderful I can blow this up huge for you thank you Kevin I appreciate the offer I appreciate the feedback [Music] oh that's what that's what Kevin Leary did to your evaluation look I really do feel that this business is worth two million dollars I've done four hundred fifty thousand dollars in lifetime sales like your business you're advertising I like your business but what he knows that we're all going to say and why he's doing his slam things we were all going to say five percent is not well you knew we were when I say that well when was the last time someone came in and said 20 left with 20 you come in and say 20 or even you guys I've seen the show so let me let me let me let me tell you but let me tell you thesis really quick my thesis really quick all right it's not about the amount of money most likely you're not only asking for funding you're asking for help and you're asking for a two million evaluation but we've done this time and time again you don't value the participation of the shark I understand you go low we go hard it's just frustrating because the foundation of the show when I first started when all first started said banks are not loaning money there's no other place to go you don't go to some place and go there's no other place to go I'll give you five percent I'm out David no thank you I do I really do appreciate the feedback Jordan right listen to me I'm very excited about you I just want to understand what you're looking for if what you need is to grow I have the relationships with every retailer in the nation and every manufacturer in the Navy absolutely but if what you need is inventory financing then you should go to a bank so what is it that you need from a shark all right what I would like help with from a shark is getting into retail distribution I'm looking for a strategic partner that understands when 9 out of 10 households in the United States have ice cream in their freezer at any given time and they cannot take it anywhere I'm gonna Jordan I just want to be able to talk for a minute so I understand your mission completely I got it the minute you said hello right it's obvious it's a very intuitive product to me I see this everywhere but here's the thing I also get I did the deal with frozen farmer I know ice cream inside out we're closing in on 15 million in sales and that's in just two and a half years is there an offer in the future knows how to run this business for you so Mark was talking to me because he does also ice Shaker and other products yeah we're going to offer you a hundred thousand dollars a front in cash a hundred thousand as a line of credit the two of us as partners together but we would like 25 percent by the way Jordan that one of the low end is five times what you were asking for and this is six times Daniel's trying to make it off or I really appreciate your offer and uh I'm gonna counter now or yes please counter now because we may not be there I would like that you don't want to hear my offer I'm just gonna I'm gonna finish with this one and then I would love to hear your offering that's bad negotiation uh I would love to work with both of you so thank you very much for the offer uh I do believe that this company does have a two million dollar or close to it valuation let me tell you why this year alone we're on attracting you four hundred thousand dollars in sales if I had more inventory this year I would have done maybe double so wait think about your ownership percentage now think about how much money goes into your pocket if you want 100 now think 10x that yeah and then it doesn't come down to the percentage of ownership it comes down to how big you can be that's the difference you need to do and that's what we can do for you exactly can I ask you a question anytime somebody makes you an offer that you can't refuse you need to learn that you can you have to wait don't don't let people bully you if they have a good offer they're gonna wait okay it's a good offer but to take one step further what I'm doing with the ice cream canteen is right now what you're seeing is one product but what I'm creating is stop selling Jordan we're trying to get the offers out you don't need to I'm trying to justify the two million valuation so the problem Jordan is if you want to stick to five percent you can't I don't want to say five percent okay so you have to come back you've got a counter or listen to him uh we do it for 15. thousand dollar line of credit would you go up to twenty percent I definitely think that we are worth 20 for sure I'll do uh I do want to I'm sorry Daniel I came all this way I want to hear your offer but I uh you know Daniel owns ice cream company can I leave this on the table or no Jordan no in any time in business any time in business this is good I'll take your deal oh appreciate it thanks a lot it's gonna be awesome I'm excited thank you thank you thank you sorry I would have loved here Daniel's offer but at the end of the day I'm really happy to have a deal with Mark and Lori so how to make the deal ",

School oh my for you do that as well Flash Forward couple years I'm working as an attorney at a great firm and I'm stable I'm comfortable but in the back of my mind I'm thinking you know what my parents never had the luxury to take any career risk to take risk at all every decision they made was how do we pay the bills today to feed our kids and I thought you know what I can take a chance and still hopefully land on my feet afterwards you know this started out as a box of belts you know but every day developing the business seeing the pride Ash had for it uh was really motivating and and kept us going Ash what's your background my background so I grew up in San Francisco um from two immigrant parents we lived in a one-bedroom apartment for most of my childhood because they thought

thank you Mark congrats we appreciate you blow me away and amaze me you've done a fabulous job it's great quality thank you but I actually have a a partner in a business that makes something that is similar but I wish you the best of luck than I'm sorry I'm out thank you Lori appreciate it uh what I've come to so much appreciate about any hardship uh is they make the best entrepreneurs yep I could remember in uh grammar school not being able to learn to read myself myself till I was barely starting in seventh grade I sometimes even think my whole career has been one long attempt to prove I'm not stupid as insecure as that might sound but what a gift it is to have an early struggle to come through it and then to play it out in the real world I think you have the ambition and the knoow to take it where you want I think you're already past the first hump which is the hardest hump in building a business I got I got to say Barber I don't know that it first is the hardest we could continue stumbling forward and be successful at some level but I do know that the right partner can make the difference in years of mistakes pitfalls and slower growth what we need more than all right all right you s me I'm going to make you an offer you're a good talker I'm going to give you $200,000 but I'm going to give you half of it in a credit line half of it in cash up front for 33% of your business okay thank you for the offer that smile just dropped really really quick talk the same time well there is one shark left so yes there is uh I chaha exactly I've been wanting to say that I find your model right now really attractive so here's my offer I'll do the 200,000 I want 20% but this is definitely a royalty deal because there's no other way to get my Capital back but the royalty

you so congratulations congratulations you guys good luck bye we got to deal with Barbara we love Barbara love Barbara so I have to give my fiance away but it was worth it was worth the equity worth the equity ", "Parting Stone": "first in the tank is a unique way to remember your past loved ones hi sharks my name is Justin and this is my grandfather Gramps collected Hobbies he loved painting and singing and Golf and Tennis and wood carving and because of this from Age 5 years old on everybody knew him as FID which is short for Fiddler my grandpa always told me the most important thing in life was to love everything I do and I've really based my life based on that advice Gramps passed away a few years ago and his death was hard for the whole family receiving his remains after The Cremation didn't make it any [Music] easier sharks this is how 1.9 million Americans every year receive the remains of their loved ones following cremation this zip tied plastic bag is how I received Gramps and that that experience was awkward and uncomfortable and every year millions of Americans have poor experiences with ashes and ears just like I did and to avoid them they're hiding one of their most treasured possessions in basement and closets and garages and so my company parting Stone invented a new form of human and animal remains following The Cremation parting Stone Service Returns the remains in a form that resembles a collection of smooth Stones the appearance of each collection of Stones varies naturally from person to person returning different Hues and textures and colors for each individual now families tell us about how they were able to hold their loved ones again share the remains with their community and spread the stones in meaningful places solidified remains are giving families a comforting way to remember their loved ones every single day sharks I'm here today seeking $400,000 for 5% of my company I believe that our past loved ones deserve better and your investment can bring a new OP to the millions of Americans who are struggling through walls wow so sharks in front of you there's a box containing one stone okay so who's who's in the Box um these are the remains of my grandfather oh uh it really is Gramps it really is Gramps I just want to say I think you're taking on something that's a very uncomfortable subject for people I mean you're transcending this idea of how we relate to ashes or death my father father was cremated I had the same thing I didn't know what to do with the ashes for a long time but I just applaud you for taking on something that's yes well new and uncomfortable thank you but how do you how do you avoid receiving the ashes Justin if you have to then our primary business is working directly with funeral homes so what do you do with the remain cost it costs uh retail for a person is $9.95 and does that including everything how many stones do you get Justin how many stones do I receive a person usually results in about 40 to 60 Stones how many funeral homes are you currently in we're currently in about 600 funeral homes in the United States and Canada and how many are there in the United States 20,000 75% of our business is B2B through funeral HS 25% is B to C I have a company called base Paws which does DNA for cats and we've got hundreds of thousands of Registries of cats that we've done the DNA testing on and we know when fluffy is going to go snuff City how many stones would fluffy turn into on an average let's say 12 lb cash yeah so average cat is maybe three to five and what do you charge to create to turn the pration of a dog or a cat into your Stones uh retail dogs are 5.95 and cats are $4.95 and what's your cost to make each of these so B2B cost is $300 that's for a human that's for a human it's 95% humans 5% pets at this time and so we think there is a huge opportunity in the pet space Justin we've got to get into the numbers now okay yeah yeah let's talk about the last 3 years why don't you ramp it up for us yes 2020 we did 350,000 do you make any money in 2020 uh no how much did you lose uh we lost about 300 2021 we did about 850,000 in Revenue okay what did you make on that or what you losing we lost 800,000 w wow 2022 we're on track for 1.3 million yeah and our loss is about 800,000 so why this business model is broken you're not charging enough let explain though why why these extreme losses we've had Engineers come through and say the losses can be fixed through automation with money so we've we've raised money in the past we've raised $2.5 million total and with this money that we're raising we're going to be spending that on automating our process so we can get to a place of profitability so there's probably about 55 Angel Investors on Jus I'll simplify things I invested in company called a turna we turn ashes into diamonds we're a direct competitor with you and so for those reasons amounts okay thank you well I just can't get past the losses and the raising that you've done and for that reason I'm out okay but thank you for your presentation we're about 2 years away from reaching a break even Point not at that pricing you won't you're going to have to raise your prices if you don't raise your prices you're de why isn't it $2,000 then You' make money well you have to test price resistance right listen I think you're going to be really successful when one is in grief over a loved one you know especially in that first year you'll do anything to bring them back to kind of get them personified and back and grieving is such a long process and to have something that's beautiful so fantastic I have no doubt that it will take off it's a little out of my wheelhouse and I do think that economics are hard so I'm out okay thank you Gana so I I think what you're doing is really genius but your numbers I was hoping that I would hear something fabulous and you have 55 investors it's a lot of investors but Kevin and I were just talking uh he finds it interesting too yeah um there's two areas that I invest in and have for decades weddings and death Recession Proof people die every day regardless of what the Market's doing that's what I like about death and blowing up the pet side going together will'll give you the 400,000 we want 20% 10 each that's what gets us up in the morning and you should do the deal for a million reasons yeah so we have other investors to consider I can't do 20 um I can I can do 7% for 400,000 I wouldn't get out of bed for 3 and 1 12% I wouldn't even die for that if you were sitting in our shoes right and we look at this you're losing money right we're thinking well what year or what decade would we ever see our money back so do you have a counter offered that you could offer us one other thing Lord hold it right there I think I'm going to come back in I like everything I'm hearing I'll give you the $400,000 cash not for 7% but for 10% but I'd like a $20 royalty per dead person and per dead animal oh my God is there a nicer way to say that how El could I say it I I couldn't think of any other are you willing to play with royalties I am willing to play with royalties uh specifically on Direct consumer sales okay so if Kevin and I were to give you the 400 cash 10% and do that same royalty structure but you get two sharks so we do the same deal we'll match bar but you get two so you'd come in for 200 each yes right you haven't questioned it would be the 10% excuse me the royalty expires once I'm repaid I'm not sure about their royalty I think that Kevin and I should match that cuz I like this and I like what you're doing and I want to get behind it it's the same deal mhm it is but you get Al you get two sharks versus one but he also has already a quite huge list for cats because of Bas Paws would you guys consider a higher royalty but on Direct consumer sales only we think that the impact that you guys can have is on the direct consumer sales I would do that a little bit differently I would say we do the 400,000 cash Kevin and I 10% equity and we'd still like the royalty on both but we'll come down on your business to business royalty let's do 20 on consumer and drop down to let's say 122 on the other but we're going to blow up your DTC okay I mean blow it up that's a deal I do Barbara from the royalty standpoint is that something you would consider as well the same structure as them I'll be honest I'm going to possibly go out okay hold on I okay I am I am into this royalty bar come on Justin you got to know it Gramps is speaking to me he's saying Barbie no I've been holding Gramps in my hand the whole time do you think Gramps we'll take it good my oh my God I thought Gramps went across the room congratulations that's a spectacular idea thank you so much looking forward to working excited really excited to work with you what a great good luck thank you guys so much now that we have Lori and Kevin on board we're going to utilize their teams their expertise to blow this up and make sure everyone in the United States knows that when you choose cremation you do not have to receive ashes there is a comforting alternative I got to tell you I like the idea so much I'm going to take it to Adele at a turn OFA and see if she can do the same thing oh well isn't that nice of you why wouldn't I look what am I going to tell are brutal this really is a shark tank yeah they're brutal right unbelievable ", "Dapper Boi": "[Music] is a brand seeking to be a better fit for all [Music] hey sharks I'm Charisse and this is my wife Vicki we're from San Diego California seeking 250 000 for five percent equity in our company when you go clothes shopping most stores have a men's section and a women's section but sharks neither of those sections work for me the women's section tends to have more form-fitting clothes which I like but I don't and while I love the men's style those clothes are just not made from my body shape sharks she's got a booty true story we're all you Unique Individuals and we believe the shopping experience should be based on style preference and body type not on gender that's why we decided to forge the future of fashion with Dapper boy a gender with size inclusive appareline made to fit you both inside and out join Dapper boy in being part of a revolutionary solution they'll bring confidence within us all that we all fit in you some diaper boy clothes we love for you to check out for you guys thank you I'm really intrigued I mean you sell direct to Consumer because you're asking retailers to create a third category right right and you know obviously we're not opposed to creating this third category or not but right now we feel like direct to Consumer is the way to go especially you know with being Mission driven brand and just being easy to shop online good looking stuff so are you blowing it up on social how are you getting the word out to your community yeah so Facebook and Instagram mostly um we're excited to start dabbling into some influencer marketing as well how do you come up with this I used to shop in the women's Department for me I never felt confident I felt frumpy I felt unseen but we started that for about seven years ago now and literally it came from a pair of jeans jeans was the first thing I tried on in the men's department and it was the scariest thing to go to that section you know to maybe be judged um but it was exactly what I wanted to be it was like the confidence I wanted that was my style you know it was emotional but years later I realized those clothes just never fit my body type and so we we saw a bunch of people just like myself with the same exact problem so I guess that your sales are less than a million please lifetime sale doesn't last seven years we've done about 3.5 and actually the way we've run our business is pre-order campaigns that's very good so we bootstrapped the brand and last year we were at 1.2 yeah oops Yeah I got you so why don't we get into the margins what do you uh what's an average margin take this shirt for example yeah that shirt is uh nine dollars 40 cents and we sell it for 6 15 we sell them for 99. nice what did you mean when you referenced a pre-order campaign how does that so how we were able to bootstrap is that we launched these products at what we call intro pricing so it's usually about a 50 percent margin at that point and that really creates a sense of urgency within our customers our repeat customer rate is 51 percent wow these people are waiting for their products to come in and how does how do you execute that exactly I've never heard that so we launched a product we put out on e-mail social everywhere and then the customers go ahead and pre-order the product and we usually deliver within six to ten weeks but I will admit here covid you know killed us right now with the code delays we're seeing six seven months wow and so how much do you have an inventory right now 60 Grand okay but it's across a lot of sizes and that's what makes it tough how much cash do you guys have maybe a hundred dollars today a hundred dollars what 100 dollars sold our house it's it's vulnerable and not fun to talk about but we believe in this brand like more than anything so far you're losing money right yes yes okay so this is killing your margin how much money are you losing yeah so I think we're about 150 000 negative what did you lose last year uh 313. so you're 450 in the hole right yeah guys something doesn't add up for me right because your margins are like this and your shipping cost shouldn't be that astronomical what happened was I also started spending in marketing I hired a consultant I would say you know it was definitely over 30 percent of oh my God so you have this rabid community that wants to buy from you you don't need to Market them it was our attempt and it was the wrong attempt to try to expand and go further but we were not ready for that we will be ready for that but not now that's why we need experts like you guys to come on board the reason why the people are waiting six and seven or eight months is like you said it's a community it's a it's a movement it it's funny that FUBU uh Forest bias has become used a lot in the lgbtq plus Community yeah am I right you are for us by us you know that that's that's who you are why are you trying to go anyplace else if other people have understand it it's no problem but why are you going anyplace there's so many people that identify with you right now stop trying to be everything to everybody you know I I have to I have to argue that and it's because I don't want to be categorized I want to fit in with everybody listen I'm listen I'm pro-black it doesn't mean that other people won't accept you so I have to be I have to be honest I have to give you my assessment of the business to find a way to help you I'll Mentor you I appreciate it for the business I'm out thank you you guys I like to sit here and say I've done a million products and I have and I've done something in just about every medium but the one thing I've really never done is jeans clothing I don't know how I could bring value to your business and help you out so unfortunately I wish you good luck but I'm out thank you very much I understand your mission I respect it there is such a need for this but I think your problem is much larger Cash Wise than you envisioned to be even you came in here and we gave you the 250 000 for your stock that's that's nothing that's not going to get you over the hump it's just it's a rough one so I wish I could be with you but I am out I wanted to mention one other thing and it's pretty important here we're about to do a collaboration with another brand that does jeans and they do 3D modeling so what happens with that is that guys guys don't do that don't do the collaboration no you have a fundamental problem you don't know what business you're in you have this community that's like this your clothes are not the product the community is looking to your your clothes as their membership as the way that they for them to say we all belong together that this is us the clothes are secondary it's keeping the community together that's important but I have a fundamental problem investor we're not on the same page on what makes the business it's about I want more inventory I've got this collaboration I've got all these other things that's not the vision I would have and it's your vision that's far more important so for those reasons amounts you're not only all in you're all in two thousand percent there's only one direction yes it's up to the surface so you can raise some oxygen that is not a wonderful place for an investor to be okay I wish you guys the best of luck but I'm out yeah thank you good luck guys thank you very much [Music] yeah this is my number thank you very much thank you appreciate it thanks great thank you guys everything and the Dapper boy and you know what at the end of the day we came here to build a relationship and I'm so happy that we walked out of here with hopefully a mentor yeah ", "Honey Bunchies": "first in the tank is a snack inspired by a love story [Music] hello sharks my name is Kendra Bennett I'm from Longmont Colorado and I'm here seeking two hundred thousand dollars in exchange for 10 of my family's business honey bun tees buckle up Dory [Music] and an Unstoppable love for his sweetheart when my dad was an F4 Phantom fighter pilot in Vietnam he got by on candy bars and cola became hyperglycemic and merely diabetic which of course doesn't fly when you're a fighter pilot that's why my mom created a honey-based snack that not only tasted great but gave him a healthy source of energy fast forward 35 years and bad try try to recreate mom's recipe but sharks he did not get it right he actually made something better dad managed to create a bar that is completely unique to the energy bar Market 42 of every honey bunchy's Gourmet honey bar is pure honey mixed with crunchy nuts and covered in lightly salted and roasted sunflower kernels it's the perfect honey pack energy boost that's gluten-free grain free and soy free and our coconut almond bar is peanut free and Mr Cuban dairy free [Music] painting but still boring world of bars so sharks let me ask you who's ready to suit up and get on the flight line with honey bunchy's Gourmet honey bars good job great job and if you don't mind this is actually my dad's Aviator jacket but it's really hot very cool can we try them oh please do please Sue wow honey is true it's really really really good that coconut almond good so yummy and delicious amazing really good my dad actually named the bar after my mom who he calls honey Bunchy and because of my dad's PTSD they couldn't come so what year did your father start the company so 2010 [Music] three years was just building the foundation but we started retelling in 2013 our first major retailer was Whole Foods we're in a total of 1200 doors now good for you we're in Whole Foods Rocky Mountain region we're in the Kroger Banner King Soopers and City Market in Colorado we're in Natural Grocers about 19 different states we actually do really well in non-grocery as well so we have a lot of independent shops all over the country what does it cost to make what and what do you sell them at are yeah it costs us we expect to end this year at 519 000. and what will you make on that 519 uh we estimated about 22k but what's really exciting is that next year we're projecting 2.2 to 4.2 million what such a large jump what's going to happen it is a large dump and there are five reasons for that large jump that's six not six five five seven eleven okay number two three Nationwide Distributors number three a national retailer that sells by the Box not by the bar number four is the anticipated growth that we're expecting online because of the billboard the first three are going to create number five is our private label client who is partly owned by two World known athletes so these aren't guaranteed purchase owners they're just in dialogue with them right actually 7-Eleven is happening there's a purchase order in hand and that's half of it as close as you're going to get to a purchase order in hand it is the opportunity to sell into all 8 500 stores at the 7-Eleven annual trade show in February so have that order though they have had a application process with 700 applicants for their brands with heart program which they are using to support emerging Brands such as ours we were in the top one percent to be offered a free booth at their annual trade show to sell into 8 500 stores so that is happening we are going to the trades but they're not guaranteeing you any any sales to any of the franchisees or corporate owned right not guaranteed but come on also convinced store by store region by region to take on the SKU I think it'll be that difficult we'll be able to trade show all of them I felt that way many times in life improve the product it's now your job to sell it into the regions David pretty in 14 7-Eleven stores and we have proof of concept we know it sells there look great product I loved it they tasted amazing but the energy bar slash candy bar business is brutally competitive and you're able to run profitably put 22k to the bottom line and continue to scale it and I know you want to accelerate that because that's what we do put gas on the fire but it'll take so much to get to a point where there's a return for me I just don't see it so for those Reasons I'm out parents story fabulous I I'm not personally a big fan of honey and that's just my thing most of the world is but I have to love what I invest in it's just not right for me so I'm sorry I'm not you're such an optimist that's what makes you a great salesperson it's your biggest liability too you're projecting 2.2 million dollars in sales next year of course you're feeling optimistic that you'll get them and I hope you do but you don't invest on someone's optimism you like to see the fact that as far as I am if I were only an option is a very hard worker and an optimist but in projecting out optimists tend to overestimate so because I don't have that belief in the numbers as much as you do I am out thank you family businesses are often tough for an investor often I I find it challenging to come in and disrupt whatever is going on so I'm out uh Kendra the amount of work ahead of you is unbelievable but you know what we're a hard work I I believe you I believe you but you know you don't know what you don't know yet but you can tell us what we don't know if that is necessary we have stretched our own personal money all this way I I take on an investor with a valuation that's completely insane valuation that you're interested in no no I just it this is everything it's it's everything we have put it on the line and we've been through a lot of hard times I mean we took a huge hit during coven and we pushed through we got through it I don't know how I mean it was hard work a lot of tears and fighting but we did it I know we have something special and I hear it every day people email us and beg us to never go away if you go and look at any of our reviews we're five star rated lately into this the road of Entrepreneurship is not a destination it's a journey it is full of heartbreak for everybody I gotta tell you I don't make emotional decisions when I invest I make pragmatic factual decisions because I have to deal with what's put in front of me I can't take this journey with you I'm out I think you might regret it I hope we do I hope we do I hope I do we wish you nothing but success I appreciate your time thank you I'm a little bummed it's okay there's always a silver lining always so I guess that's my Optimist side um but it's gotten us this far and we'll keep going there's no question it's very hard to say no I feel like somebody was going to cave and say yes I was afraid it was going to be me very hard to optimism as you said Barbara is challenging because everything she said she didn't actually technically have oh she believed it no doubt ", "Play Maysie": "next up is hours of play time in a convenient [Music] container hi sharks my name is Kayla Lupine I'm from Cleveland Ohio and I am seeking $150,000 for 10% of my company play Maisy sharks my daughter loves to play but as a first time Mom I was clu to the frustrations that toys add to a household I was investing more time trying to find missing pieces than my daughter was spending playing with them not to mention walking around the house at night was like navigating a Minefield of loose toys one wrong step and Bam I scream she wakes up and I still have a house full of toys to clean up toys should bring joy to a home not mess that's why I created play mey play mey is a portable dollhouse for quality play on the go and less mess at home our cases were inspired by vintage tin lunch boxes that open on both sides to reveal two interchangeable rooms our magnetic floors with attached wooden furniture means no loose pieces no lost pieces and no more bottom of the foot ois for moms and dads when play time is over simply close your case put them on a shelf stack them in a pile or hang them on a hook for easy clean up and all-in-one storage whether you're planning a long car ride or just looking to clear the clutter in your home play mey keeps your child's imagination active and your cleaning to-do list a little bit shorter so who's ready to help me save the souls of parents all across America with playing SE great presentation cute so this is it in front of us so in front of you you each have a case Mark you have our wild case wild baby the wild case is camping and fishing Barbara you have our home case which is a kitchen and living room Mr Wonderful you have red so it was you could try it on and Lori you have our cozy case which is a bedroom and bathroom and Damon you also have our wild case wild that's very cool cute it's very well it's like a a magnetic dollhous right are there only two characters so there's a set of six characters and it was really important to me two things to make this very gender neutral I believe that doll play especially for boys is very important um and I really wanted everything to be as inclusive as it could be for the first launch of the product my goal with this is to expand and the line of cases um building out the character story line so I just finished the first book that the illustrations are almost done that is about each character and I want this to be a brand where kids get to know the characters love the characters I am going to be the next big toy brand in America aha tell us about you tell us your story so in 2013 I got divorced I moved out on my own for the very first time I'd never lived by myself and I really invested invested the next few years in building my photography business and so I had dated for a few years nothing was working out and I kind of jokingly said to my mom maybe someday I'll just adopt and I'll do this on my own she worked at an OBGYN Clinic I asked if anyone ever came in looking to place their baby wow she asked the doctor said it hadn't happened in 25 years and the next day a couple came in asking if he knew anyone looking to adopt un oh wow that's F wow and that's my daughter on the front of the packaging so it's really been an amazing journey Christmas of 2020 I was a wedding photographer previously lost all my business with Co and then Christmas night I had this idea and I took my $25,000 personal savings built a Kickstarter I filed all of my trademarks I did the uh provisional patent the website an initial logo okay what does it cost landed so landed is about $13 including all the components including everything what what do you sell it for online I sell them for $449.99 so we about a 70% margin so tell us about the business yeah so I launched my Kickstarter March of 2021 how much did you try to raise and how much did you end up raising so I tried to raise 25,000 I ended up raising 30,000 all organically um I immediately took that $30,000 and started the molds for the tins I was short on money for the production run so I sold my car we received the product November 15th and then um we ended up closing out 202 won with total revenue of $170,000 wow for you and what are your year-to date sales so I ran into an issue so I knew that I was going to receive a purchase order and they wouldn't tell me how much inventory it was going to be for that's difficult but in order for me to get it in time I needed to place the order before I would know the quantity so I ordered 5,000 units how much did they they wind up ordering so they only ordered a few hundred cases oh God I did find an investor they invested $85,000 to pay for the inventory and the shipping they took 10% and it has been the biggest blessing to be able to get there sales year to date I think are 55,000 and what do you think it will be end of the year I think I'll be around 400,000 at the end of the year 400 how much inventory do you have one hand what is it worth right now I have just over 9,000 units on hand and that's worth about half a million in Revenue okay I don't feel like I gotten the the vision of growth clearly okay I like the product however as for the business I'm out okay thank you so much ston um Kayla this is uh very admirable what you've done okay thank you I'm out this is not a business for me okay Kayla one quite impressed that you didn't know how to do any of this and you created rapidly a really wonderful toy but I go for the 3ps I passion perseverance and product and for me you were passion you perseverance but the product just isn't the right product for me I wish you good luck but I'm out thank you so much yeah kayb you deserve a ton of credit I mean the adversity you fought through but you're also in a great position and I don't think you're giving yourself enough credit there and if you just keep it simple you can have a business where you're making two three $400,000 a year starting next year and then look to scale I think you're trying to do too much too soon okay so for those Reasons I'm out well I appreciate that you're welcome I'm happy you saved the best F last I don't think there's a more adorable product than what I see here it's well designed it's well thought through everything packages so well but more important than the business you've got the courage thank you you demonstrate the courage all along the way to be who you wanted to be I'm I'm so overwhelmed by that all right I think the idea that you became a single mother one in a 100 women who say that actually do it you went and did it and you deserve the good luck of finding your daughter of course when I was a little kid my mother invented this her toys for the 10 of us were the C's robot catalog where we cut out beds and plates and sheets and made our houses and she painted all the clothes Pitts that she hung the wash

credit line if you keep it at 30% you know Kayla it occurs to me that she said all those nice things to you just before she became a Savage I'm not hardly a Savage I've already given 10% to another

congratulations I created this business for my family for my daughter and every day I show up and work to show her what is possible and today is just the greatest example of how far you're able to go when you really put your mind and work into something ", "Tia Lupita": "next up is a food brand inspired by recipes handed down from Generations [Music] hola sharks my name is Hector Saldivar and I'm from Tiburon California means shark I'm seeking five hundred thousand dollars in exchange of five percent of my company Tia Lupita oh duh sharks I'm gonna ask you for a favor raise your hand if you like to eat taco no tacos for you Damon I hate tacos raise your other hand if you like to eat clean simple ingredients now try to touch your ears with your elbows you nobody can do that yeah believe me I've tried it's impossible just like it's impossible for current Mexican Brands to bring Innovation and keep their authenticity using artificial ingredients binders and fillers growing up in Mexico we don't inherit cars jewelry or mud what gets passed down to us are family recipes the better for you Mexican inspired food brand then used to that starts with one of the world's most sustainable plants the cactus cactus or nopales is a Mexico sweetheart a low glycemic superfood that we use in our line of brain free tortilla chips and tortillas sharks be prepared to fall in love with our five flavors of tortilla chips they have all the crunching texture that you're used to but are packed with source of fiber and we have two types of tortillas a grain tree and Cactus made with upcycled okara and cassava and a corn and Cactus now if you're wondering why they're green it's because of all that dinero we're gonna make together the Filipino We Believe two things food is love and eating good should be easier than trying to touch your ears with your elbows so who's ready to make everyday Taco Tuesday in America nicely done I have some tortillas there's a there's a bag here of [Music] yes started with a little salsa out of there and then go into the medium body hot sauce which is what we call the OG then uh Chipotle and then habanero this is one of the first iterations grain free tortilla chips that taste good thank you so much Mr Wonderful the tortillas are good and it's only 45 calories for a whole tortilla absolutely yes you can give us your background and why you decided to go into your business I'm originally from Monterey Mexico I moved here 18 years ago my mom Lupita would ship me care packages though like a regular mom does now granted a regular care package would be a sweater or some socks maybe a little money if you're lucky my mom would send me hot sauce it's a family recipe hot sauce that had been passed down to a single family member so I started sharing that with friends and colleagues and everybody started falling in love with my mom's hot sauce then they started planting the seed and so I started ideating this bottling and commercializing this the my mom's hot sauce okay I came to the realization that the the current Mexican brands or Hispanic Brands here in the United States were not doing anything to innovate we would bring Innovation and we're trying to change the perception that Mexican food is unhealthy and that's when I decided that yellow Pizza would be quick become more than just a hot sauce brand that would become a platform brand Hector how many years ago was that we started in 2019. tell us what your revenues are for the last three years so in 2020 we did 900 000 wow wow okay 2021 we did 1.5 yeah million yeah and this year we're going to do 4 million wow are you profitable last month was our first profitable month congratulations thank you so much I'm very proud where are you selling we're in Sprouts nationally five regions of Whole Foods key Regional accounts from Wegmans to Walmart we have Target on site Publix do you have to pay to get listed there and actually last year we took a huge hit with slotting how big is that hit so in 2020 it's around 700k okay in 2021 we lost 1.2 oh so how much have you invested or brought in we've raised 1.9 uh so far and now we're doing we're doing a full seed what percentage of the company do you own I still own around 65 percent how much of your own money did you invest uh around 700k you're all in good for you we did a more uh line of credit against our mortgage and and our home yeah on our home and damn Hector yeah well at projected four million in sale you're doing something right um but I just don't like it's not that I dislike my Google I just don't love it I don't believe that I would have the passion to be able to help you with this so I'm out thank you so much Damon I appreciate it I think this is a long journey and a cash Rich journey I don't think the 5 is going to get you there I'm out thank you so much yeah Hector I'm along the same lines I think the tortillas were great but grime numbers working for me so for that reason amount absolutely and so Mike I appreciate that and we do have a path of profitability we we proved it last month let's focus on that Hector because you never told me what it cost you to make the product right so walk me through the cactus grain-free sea salt let's just go with this one what does it cost to make this yeah that bag cost us about dollar and fifty cents yes and then we retail it between 399 and 4.99 it's competitive with other grain free tortilla chips out there I have been looking for a product for Chef wonderful that's grain free because that's my whole stick these days it's healthier eating and this is one of the best I've tasted I got to tell you that but these numbers are tough they're very tough Hector while he's thinking I'm gonna jump in I think you've done a really great job what concerns me though is you have a lot of debt there's a lot going on financially that really worries me so for me it's not the right investment I'm sorry I'm out thank you Lori as usual all roads lead back to Mr Wonderful I've heard that so many times unfortunately so have we it's a tough deal I think you asked too much because Laura is right you got a ton of debt on this thing and you've mortgaged your house which scares me if I can say one more thing I just want to try to sell myself because I haven't done enough the opportunity I've worked so hard for these last four years they've been uh everything to me uh it's honoring not only my culture my Heritage my mom right today one month ago my dad passed away and I should have been there with my mom right now in his one month but I couldn't say no to this opportunity we're we're All In here's an offer five hundred thousand dollars in debt it's going to be 36 months I'm going to do interest to 12 and a half percent which is current ouch sorry that's current this Market yeah and I want 10 of the company [Music] I take a huge risk here Hector huge this is like a line of credit you're you're yeah I'll do it as a line of credit you draw it down but I want first money back first absolutely are you allowed to subordinate are you able to subordinate the debt yes absolutely yes okay the concern here is the double of the equity I understand that Hector but you're asking me to get behind this product with my whole team back you if I do this deal I can't do another one like it this is my deal in this space so that's the decision I have to make if I I'm frankly I'm not getting out of bed for five percent Hector I'm sorry you don't have to do this deal but it's the only one I'm gonna do then you get a better deal elsewhere after speaking on your behalf that's a rich deal well you didn't make him an offer Barbara I was honest about that right in front of you wanted an offer on Shark Tank you just about when you may not like it but that's why I don't want the Shark Tank you can counter yeah I mean I think Mr Wonderful the the the ten percent is the only thing that is that is I don't know if it's not anything yet do you know what it takes to sell a company in the snack area you got to get to 50 million before any strategic is even interested what second you you're willing to give you knew you know that's what I'm also thinking you're going to keep raising money I'm going to get deluded I mean I've seen this movie before my friend if I start at five percent I'll have less than one percent by the time you're finished getting the 50 million would you do the same deal for a seven and a half percent [Music] I totally I see the value of you coming in and you know you would bring so much but I don't I don't know if that's the right deal right now different than any investor you have he's more arrogant I'm sorry I know my value Hector you got to make a decision I'm not flexible is there is there any flexibility with the with with the equity 500 000 I cry like a baby when I lose 500 000. I get on my knees and I and it happens a lot why don't you ask him for school for a million you can offer you can ask for anything you want the answer is no great deals both sides feel pain I'm feeling pain about 500 000 I'm putting at risk you're feeling pain about the ten percent that hasn't doesn't have any value yet Kevin it's alone how's it arrests you've got to go issue shares that's diluting me down from ten percent why don't you make it non-dilutable I could do that we can work that in we'll make those you're sure it's not deludable you stay at your stand for what I'll do the 500k in as a line of credit in exchange of five percent and you those those that five percent that you own will not get diluted it's a good deal right there for you Kevin after you have a deal [Music] [Applause] Mr Wonderful it's a pleasure you too man yes thank you so much congratulations Hector well done ","See The Way I See":"next up is a company with a mission to normalize mental health [Music]

"Nature's Wild Berry": "first in the tank is a unique proof that magically transforms flavor another dude stealing my hair hey sharks I'm Juliano and I'm Hank we're from Santa Monica California and we're looking for 80 000 in exchange for 15 of our business Hank what do you do when you eating a straight up lemon right now yeah dude candy hold on what kind of a berry makes a lemon taste like candy Nature's wild berry just chew this Berry and it'll turn anything sour tart even fermented sweeter than sugar that sounds like a magic wizard Berry to me pop one of these bad boys open and give it a try for 30 seconds okay but you gotta explain to me how does this work Miracle Berries contain a glycoprotein which right now are binding to The Taste receptors in your mouth blocking anything sour and instead making it sweet anything what about that pickle right there make that sweet try it foreign now try some of this Ultra tart cranberry juice hmm it tastes like candy I told you let's see if you could throw back this shot of apple cider vinegar okay it tastes like apple juice wow magic with this Berry you can transform your taste buds unlocking hidden flavors from food and drinks you never thought were possible so how about it sharks who wants to get wild with Nature's Wildberry try the magic out yourselves so what you want to do first is you got a whole bunch of stuff there try the food that's on your plate beforehand I just kind of want you to get a before and after type exactly wow oh my God [Music] horrible that's unsweetened cranberry you won't want to forget the green juice so make sure you try that I've tried everything what do I do with them now we're going to take two berries two berries and you're gonna chew those it's gonna be like a fruit infused popcorn favor the berry 30 seconds make sure it moves all over here at the same time yeah this just turned into a sweet pickle that's crazy the lemon tastes like an orange that's really incredible this is insanity oh it does taste like an orange right how long does it last it lasts about 20 to 40 minutes I feel like a miracle is happening right now it tastes like an orange you're right but a polar trick though is this some kind of tree by the minute and it starts to get sweeter yes as you have it so what's the purpose but like what are you thinking to do with this as a product so this transformed my life I used to be 250 pounds size 40 plus weights and facing diabetes that's right and oh there you go that's a picture of me you look a lot better now thank you well I realized that people were using this Berry a lot for novelty but my best friend here had a restaurant and he was using me as a guinea pig at the time because he wanted to test these berries out but I needed real help I had kind of lost hope I was just gaining weight and what was it you were just attracted to Sweet Food actually I identify as an emotional eater I started eating for anything drinking for anything and really the thing that most people don't understand as emotional eaters is that discipline and willpower have absolutely nothing to do gosh sometimes all you can think about is taste uh lucky for me he specialized in taste and he made the healthiest green juice I'd ever seen in fact you got that you craved that sweet taste right but right so now you could eat things that were healthy for you but they tasted sweet so you like that clean I have two I have three things here in front of me those are our usual best sellers that's called our travel jar because you can take it and put it in your pocket and travel with it so how much is this that is 24.99 wow for just this thing so when yes for just that's not so sweet before you say that when we came into the market so I looked online I found it and it said five berries for fifty dollars how much does it cost you right now okay so right now that cost us about two dollars and 64 cents so let's talk about sales what are you going to sell this year uh we are projected to do about 340 000 and how are you selling that 340 000. so right now we are on the largest online retail and people know what it is that is probably the biggest difficult things it just sounds wacky exactly 50k and who else is selling this it's a commodity so when I go online to look for people who are selling these berries it's still pretty rare actually so why are they rare it's extremely difficult to grow so are you growing them or you have a self-supply so we looked all over the world for a supplier for the berry and then the one that ultimately was the best supplier was somebody in uh in America and do you have a lot of money in the business he initially dropped 120 000 so he went all in either as much as I could in there in total I probably threw about 20 grand in there okay guys I'm gonna take a flyer on you because it's such a crazy thing you guys own the business 50 50. yes okay I want to be a third partner so I'm going to give you the 80 000 for 33 percent okay I want five dollars a unit until I get back 160 000 so I double my money because I'm Banker here but it's not a royal team perpetuity okay but for me it's a flyer it kind of fits into what I do as a chef thank you so much I just want to help you guys if you really are passionate about having somebody take the journey I'm I believe I'm the one situated for now with my new found faith in Fitness 80 000 for 30 no royalty like the blood sucking Kevin over here to take that Journey with you what do you say let me change my offer just to make it competitive okay [Music] offers on the table for Nature's wild berry their supplement that makes tart Foods taste sweet let me change my offer just to make it competitive okay eighty thousand dollars for twenty percent equity to slightly higher than what you want but I'm leaving my royalty in place so you guys still are in control anyways [Music] as well we'll offer you eighty thousand dollars for twenty percent but I would like three dollars per unit until I get my money back I don't I'm just willing to take the ride because it's so interesting thank you guys the question I'm trying to answer is what's the accelerant because you have your personal experience and it's been great people are always trying to lose weight but you can't make that claim so who is the target audience if you're struggling with sweets that's the most obvious and in that group is a lot of people we've had birthday parties we have parents who want their kids to eat something trying to figure out how you sell millions of dollars worth right look I think it's great this is this has got it all the time all the time and you've got little jars you know on tables whatever I just don't know what that path is well here I gave an offer I offered you eighty thousand dollars twenty percent three dollars per unit and so I would like to know whether or not you like my offer because you have two other offers we've been sitting here a while let me clear the deck on this side I think it's just too wacky for me although I'm very impressed by you and the product I'm out thank you by the way all right guys you guys listen can we take literally four seconds you know because you have two other people here I would rather go in with another shark because honestly you know if one of you guys wants to party 20 20 for two sharks absolutely two sharks three dollars per I mean I do it with Mark if he wants to do it deal s too much big mistake why would you do that listen I'll tell you what for all of you though if you want to contact us you get free berries anytime you want just let us know hahaha you mean it oh my gosh for everyone that said we should go on Shark Tank they were right I guess they're all right okay we got the same two sharks that we always wanted thinking about this validation from Mark and Lori it makes me emotional because it's been six years and it's been a very long journey to get here and we've traveled through so many obstacles but now we're here and we've got the deal and it's all worth it ", "Noshi": "next into the tank is a company that encourages kids to play with their food no no no no no no no sharks my name is Tomo I'm a stay-at-home dad to two very very picky eaters and I cannot tell you the number of times I've heard the word no it's the one superpower that kiddos can wield over their parents from a really young age and the place they use it most is the dinner table they'll push it pull it slide it hide it kids will do anything to avoid eating the food on the place in front of them let's turn those nose into yeses with noshi edible organic food paint and condiments that kids can use to turn any Meal Time into an art class write your name on your breakfast a smiley face on a cheeseburger or just go wild and spray abstract art over whatever's in front of you the options are Limitless just like a child's imagination use flavors like strawberry peach or mango for Fruity fun or our kid approved condiments like SketchUp crayonays mustard and more noshi contains no preservatives no artificial colors no artificial flavors just good clean organic fun sharks get imaginative with me here for a second I'm asking for 250 000 of bees in exchange for 17 of noshi the Sharks I'm working at a distinct disadvantage here because none of you is six years old if you were I'd already have a deal that's how much kids love this stuff but for now I'm asking you all to get in touch with your inner child and play with noshi and after that let's play with some numbers please play with your food very well [Music] why not so you've got a box of SketchUp a box of Peppa Pig food paint and a box of Crayola food paint this is brand new Crayola yeah so you must have a deal with it we've got license deals with Peppa Pig Crayola Very Hungry Caterpillar and Daniel Tiger the part I like about that is you like royalty deals I'm not a versatile and that's for sure it seems like not a lot of ketchup group here I I think it's about right the box has three tubes in it and I think you know you use a tube per meal time and even with two kids you could probably you know split a tube between two kids and what does the container sell for uh it sells for 546 546 okay and what are you making it for um at the moment it's about 272 but with the money from here if I got it we would buy two pieces of Machinery which takes 60 cents oh when you sell a box of three four wholesale wholesale 370. okay so your margins are awful okay you must have sales last year it was a hundred and seventeen thousand dollars what do you think this year will be this year so far we've sold just under 80 000 I think it's probably gonna end up being 200 000 by the end of the year especially why so small how many stores do you have we're in 370 Walmart stores how much you selling online we haven't sold any online this year because I've got a situation at home my wife has got long covered and she's been in bed for three years oh no so since then I've been bringing up my two children almost as a single parent and looking she's a long hauler in covet yeah I mean she had a really successful career and I don't think she's ever going to work again so oh my God that makes it incumbent on me to make this a success in New York at the end of last year my wife and I sat down and for the first time we discussed the fact that she probably wouldn't ever work again so we agreed that she would move back to England and be cared for by her parents which is where she's been for the last nine months wow to be horrible terrible I mean is it the kids especially you know I mean my priority as a human being as a parent is to keep them as happy and healthy as possible what were you doing before this happened I grew up in the English Countryside and when I was 13 I started reading my mom's Vogue magazine and I thought I want to work then so I left home when I was 16 and three years later I was working at Vogue magazine wow so I was a producer I was a product photographer working for Tom Ford Donna Karen but then when our son was born in 2010 I thought I'm really I'm starting to grow out of this industry my wife at the time was the CEO of a marketing company in New York and was making really good money so we decided that I would become the stay-at-home parent at which point I discovered that both of my kids were extremely picky eaters took me a year to find a formulator took him another 18 months to get the formulas to a point where we were happy with them and we launched in 2017. we went straight into about 80 Albertsons 110 Safeways and every branch of Jewel-Osco and I think we probably sold about twenty thousand dollars worth about you out of all those stores yeah it's because people don't know what it is because it's a unique product people didn't know what it was I had designed the packaging thinking I was a Christmas can we go to 2018 because I just want to see the trajectory 2018 2019 2020 they were all the same because the packaging was wrong did you stay in that re in those retailers no we came out of those Safeway an outlets in stores in 2018 in early 2019 I was at Expo West and on the last day of the show this young guy came out of the crowd and he handed me a business card and I turned it around and it said Walmart's on it it was that easy I've got these four amazing license deals we're in Walmart Walmart have stuck with us for three years how does Walmart feel about how you're selling we had last week that Walnut are going to put SketchUp into 1500 stores next year are they selling through currently yeah we sell you know in the last three production runs are the first three ever that we've sold through and we've sold through all three so I'm listening to the story and and I would say you were a Michael man given what you've been through what's bothering me is a lack of sales this is 2017 it's been relatively flat then I have to consider that you're a one-man show on this thing I'm having to buy one you guys no I get it but I don't need a job I'm an investor you may find that one of these other sharks wants to take this journey with you but it's not me I'm out okay I'm sad to hear that but thank you Kevin I'm feeling that that don't belong in a food aisle I think it needs to be a gift item I don't see it as a competitive food item and appearing next to the ketchup in a food aisle because I don't have confidence in the product where it's positioned and how you sell it I'm out okay that's a shame farmer I think it's a clever idea there's a lot of things you did right but there's not enough here for me today offer okay and so I wish you good luck thank you that's a shame but thank you very much I think that at six dollars I think this is a great novelty one time and then a parent says and it's almost six dollars every every meal I think that's where you may be having a little bit of resistance on the sales and and I wish you luck and I really respect who you are but I'm out okay thank you thank you very much Mark it's the top thing I can do to convince you yeah the I think is shelf presence right you've got to know what you're looking for or you've got to get attention very quickly yeah this says nothing it's pretty damn cool I think Crayola will get a lot more attention I agree I mean the reality is what you do online is going to be far more important yeah that's how you're going to make all your money yeah so what are you going to do to get online well the problem is of course is that I'm going to need fans to produce the product to sell online yeah I mean um help me out Mark come on we've got Walmart expansion is there any way you consider doing these as one-offs so that people can see them and try them to Damon's point right it's hard to make an investment of the six dollars or whatever it is you they sell for retail if you have a little basket just full of different flavors and each of these are 1.99 parents are going to pick them up yeah I know they're doing anything absolutely from day one I knew that this was a really good idea and whenever you show this stuff to a child you're reassured of that all right um I'll offer you the 250k I don't believe it for 25 percent [Music] okay done and I hug you yes you can thank you so much this is a journey that I always knew was worth taking and I can see the end game and we can get there so much was riding on this you know my situation at home is such that I had to get a deal I had to do something to provide for my family for the future and Mark's just helped me do that ", "You Go Natural": "next up is a product designed to protect while being [Music] stylish hey sharks I'm Monique little CEO I'm

look cool it's great I'm very cool this is grippy this is strong it's heavy this is heavier than like an average bathing cap this thing is amazing it's the why didn't I ever think about it I think of this thing what do you sell them for and what do they cost you yeah so we man all of our products in Dallas Texas they range from $4 to $7 to manufacture and the pricing ranges from $35 to $48 wow that's relativ Che the production so low in Dallas because we know how to work in Dallas Kevin yeah we do maybe it's time to talk about sales because you have a valuation of $8 million here all right so I'll walk back um so we today we've sold over $15 million of product yes sir 15 million we're a six-year-old company 2020 we did $2 million 2021 we did 7.5 wow this year we're tracking $10 million in sales wow wow did you make any money on that 7.5 the year you did 7.5 million so the beginning of last year we raised $2 million oh wait a minute why what did you use that for so we used it to exp to expand our product line and invest in the manufacturing facility did you profit on your sales we did not last year last year we lost $2 million this year we will be profitable wait wait wait last year you lost I'm sorry I heard you raised yeah and then you also lost 2 million you're running so with all the margins you guys have what were the costs so we over ordered on inventory last year um so how much did you have that means you rode off a lot of inventory right exactly so you fell into the Trap where you raised a lot of money thought you were going to grow really fast so now how much cash do you have in the bank so we have just about 100 Grand in the bank Oo we will be so we we will be profitable this year so we're going to Target in February of 2023 your sales grew very quickly and you thought that was going to be sustainable so you went all in thinking you're going to grow 5 10 times what are your customer acquisition costs now uh customer about $30 how much did you spend last year in advertising we spent about $3 million in advertising last year that's a lot going into this year our goal was moving into an efficiency we had the decision okay do we raise and do we keep on hitting the gas or do we pull back have kind of like trying to make money was a good call yeah right and so we've kind of turned we've turned that around so I make it for seven I sell it for 48 direct to Consumer I pay 30 of that in customer acquisition cost so I'm dealing with just under 10 bucks a profit this is why we're here this is why we're looking at our raise is that we want to prepare for Target how many stores you going to do on that roll out 316 that's a test right yeah the first products are going to be our headbands which is really interesting the headbands are made from our remnant of the turbin and it's the lowest price point product so it's a $10 product it's made from our Remnant product it goes into Target and we still get to sell our core product online because we're innovating this maret that's your efficiency thing that you're trying to do by using excess material no but let me tell you something using the remnant inventory sounds Clean and Smart but it's going to take you time it's going to you're going to look that way this way you have to contend with the store itself you have to ship it's not just Remnant inventory it's the most valuable thing you have which is your time and your focus I think it has to be demonstrated you should stick with youran I think your play clearly is online so I'm out I can't really bring anything to the table here on the St out thank you thank you when I heard your sales ramp I thought maybe I should grow my hair back I'm kidding that that was really impressive but I into the numbers I'm not a fan of the retail move for a bunch of reasons servicing a retailer is a whole different bag and i' prefer to see you spend all your time reducing your customer acis costs right guys it's not for me I'm out okay thank you thank you I appreciate it uh the way I look at it is um no pun intended though it looks like you're wearing too many hats um but if I just did the math it would take me 5 years just to break even you having no problems at all and doubling your business so I don't want to take away from the fact that this is great the product thank you thank you apprciate with that being said I'm out you guys product amazing I love it what scares me is the losses that just happened you had incredible sales but you also took a real hit and to invest almost a half a million dollars for 5% is just scary we have room for negotiation yeah we have room for negotiation and I think it's one of those things where sorry I can't um unfortunately I'm out okay so guys the big question has been how much are you willing to give right so I'm willing to make an offer but it's going to be really really really Sharky okay right I'll give you the 400k but I want [Music] 20% that's Sharky no think that's ACC because of all the uncertainty that you where that bathing cap for a while you want to start sweating you'll get my help and obviously in Dallas I can help this is how Sharky that offer was he took your value valuation from 88 million to 2 million what are you going to do so what we propose um is 12% of the company for that 400k um we also wanted to throw out a deal to everyone else here um that is 400k as a debt deal with some form of royalty wait so wait wait wait so wait wait wait so now you're walking away you're looking at others from me we're we're coun we're countering at 12% um for like baby let's go to dinner but hey we wait are you offering that debt deal tomorrow why don't we just get that before we talk royalties why don't we figure out what that you have a you have a fish on the line which is Mark don't offend this fish I know him no no no you know we're I mean we I we love you Mark and that is Cash sound like right right and so we we want a partner and so so we think that okay the only way the way I would do it then so if you're saying you're open to a royalty so let's say $3 on the headband $5 on everything else till the loan is paid back then what Equity are you offering me we would offer 7% make a 10 and you have a deal what up to you you do it deal good job guys you were making us a little nervous there yeah we'll make it work thank you thank you so much apprciate it thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you than thank you Mark what's with this royalty deal stuff they offer I'll take it you are learning grasshopper you are learning their offer not mine we did it because we manufacture it right there in Dallas it's can be super helpful for him to help us understand okay what are good areas that we can grow our facility and build for the long term so we're just you know I think it's going to be game changing ", "Krapp Strapp": "First into the tank is a solution for an inconvenient problem in the great outdoors. [Music] Good morning, Sharks. I'm Bob Le and I'm Keith Lindsay and we are Airboss Outdoors and we're from Jacksonville, Texas and we're here to ask you for $65,000 for a 10% equity in our necessities product business. At our boss outdoors, we design and develop innovative solutions to some of those age-old problems that outdoorsmen have experienced for years. In the outdoors, you go out and you relax and you have a good time. But there's always there's a number one problem relieving yourself in the woods. [Laughter] We've developed the number one necessity for doing number two outdoors. Let me introduce you to the crap strap. That's good. allows everybody a comfortable doing the deuce outdoors. Wait a minute now. Doing the deuce out. You can see how it works. You just simply attach it around your waist. Attach it to a strong structure like a tree or even a fence post. Uh you could use the bumper on a vehicle even. You simply lean back and let it fly. What the hell? And relieve yourself. Oh, Bob, I was worried we're going to see everything there. I tried to get it on TV, but I couldn't get there. It It will take and hold 400 lb. It's got two pockets, each one on each side. toilet paper, corn cobs, leaves, or any other thing you want to put in it. Now, how many of you onehanded can take a piece of toilet paper and make it into a nice wipable piece of equipment while you're hanging on to the tree? You're still hanging on to the tree. Let's say you get through that. Well, you got to finish up the job onehanded. M well let me just tell you onehanded and you don't do enough and you leave a residual it's going to itch when it dries back now by God the reason you're laughing is cuz you've been there. No, it's so true, right? So true. Right. True. Now, Sharks, we've come a long way from Jacksonville, Texas. And we honestly, we came here today to make a deal with the Marco, Texas. Get up here, Mark. Go demonstrate. Mark, no one drops a deuce better than me. You know, my man, Bob. Yes, sir. Why do you say it holds corn on the cob? Cuz anything you want to put in it to do the wiping job, people use the corn cups. What? Oh my god. Where are you from? All right, Mark. Hey, wait a minute. Move it down on his waist a little bit and pull your feet. Pull your feet forward. Come on. All the way in, Mark. All the way in. Oh, yeah. Go. No, Mark. Mark, like Lori would tell you, knees up. Squatty potty level. I I need the knees like way up there, baby. Squatty potty like a dog. Like all knees way up there. Yeah. Yeah. [Music] [Laughter] This is great. Mark, do you feel like you're seated? Like comfort. It's comfortable. It actually works. Yeah, it's comfortable. That's cool. So, I have to find out about you. I'm 81 years old. I'm a young relationship, dude. I got to watch one. I can bend my knees, but then I can't get up. And was this your first invention? No, ma'am. Our company started with motion decoys. What's a motion decoy? When you put decoys out, I go duck hunting. What do they do? They just They just sit there. Right. Right. Well, I put a motor in them so they'd move and the ducks would say, \"Hey, dude. There's someone down there. Let's go. Anyway, uh I sold the company and it whatever and then about three four four years back got associated with Keith whom I have known for 30 years and we developed an outdoor business. Okay, let's talk about sales. Has anybody bought the crab strap? Yes. The crabstrap went on the market in October of last year. Yeah. Okay. With zero advertising dollars spent. Y last year we sold approximately 4,000 units between October how many dollars? Every unit went through our e-commerce website. How much it charge for it? $49.95 each. What does it cost you to make it? $50. Wow. 200 grand worth of craft straps in four months. What does it cost you to make? Cost $17. And and it was no advertising whatsoever. No advertising. How did people know? Was it your existing customer? Oh, no. Don't know. How did they know? I'll tell you exactly. July the 1st, he put it online just just for one social media post by me. That was on the first. That's a Friday, Tuesday. It had been seen by a,200 people. And we had a list of wild and bully. So, can I ask you what what do you need the money for? I want to be clear about our intentions for your $65,000. Okay? You know, the people that have been really successful at marketing, e-commerce, social media, advertising, we have tried some of that and we waste money. Okay. We try on that. We we waste money on that. So, we get it. So right now what you're saying is that you want to take the money and I guess the partnership to do the sales and market. Exactly what we want. A partnership. Go ahead. I want to part I want to have some fun. [Music] You know, I think it's so inspiring to see you here creating products and building a business. Bless you. And I think it's a great product because sales don't lie. and you've got sales. We did. But I will not be going on the crap trap journey with you. It's not for me, but I wish you all the best. I'm out. But there's four other sharks and one from Texas. Well, thank you, Keith and Bob. Fantastic presentation and right to the point. I was a camp counselor as a teenager and I've had my rear end bitten by mosquitoes while doing number two. And that's why I have a new motto for my life. Every night I have to sleep somewhere where there's a mint on my pillow. That's how I work. I I think this is a fantastic product. You think about products on Shark Tank for 15 years. No, there's never been a crap strap. Never. Ever. And it works. But guys, I'm not your Shark. I'm out. We appreciate you, Mr. Kevin. Keith and Bob, I think that um I'm actually interested. I'm one of I think I'm the only outdoors person here, but I'll be very honest. Uh there's another shark here. She would be interested because she happens to have been in this space in different categories. Squatty Potty. Uh I think he has some other products in this area. I'm asking if I can get another shark in on here if she's interested. I I I will go in on it with you. I'll clear the I'll clear the deck because I wanted to make sure you guys got an offer because you'd be fun to work with. But Damon's the outdoor shark and he understands better than I do. So, I'll go out and if their deal is nasty, then I'll come back in. So, what are you guys gonna do? What do you have? Wait, they're getting ready. You got to stop selling. Okay. So, Damon and I discussed this. We realize you need a lot of help with a lot of things. Yes, we do. Thank you. Damon and I are going to go in on it, but we want to be more equal partners to you. You came in asking for 65,000 for 10%. We're going to ask for 65,000 for 35%. [Music] Ichi wawa kamba. It's not bad. There you go. There you go. So, we will collectively own one/3 and I'm assuming 45% and be done with this. Give us a little bit of room. Yeah, let's 33 and a3. Damon loves that number. Bob, we're there. We're done. We're done. Congratulations, guys. Well done. Well done. Now you two can say you help people do the deuce outdoor. Do the deuce outdoor. Thank you, man. You did great. You did great. Thank you. I love you, too, man. All right. Thank you, brother. Now, you didn't take a crap while we were here talking, did you? Damn it. How did you know? Bob, you're a star, buddy. You're a star. Thank you. We love you. It's going to be so much fun. Oh my god. Oh my god. Good job, Bob. You go, boy. We'll all make some money. It's fun. They enjoyed it. I loved it. ", "Mini Materials": "Next up is a big idea for those who think [Music] small. Hello Sharks. My name is Jared Waters. I am from Portland, Oregon, and I am seeking $100,000 in exchange for 20% equity in my company. Sharks. The world has been through a lot of big changes these past few years. A big pandemic, a big recession. In fact, all of our problems have gotten too dang big. We need more cute in the world. It's time to think small. Smaller. Smaller. Smaller. That's what I'm talking about. Introducing Mini Materials. Authentic, highquality, modern miniature building supplies for dollhouse construction, diaramas, and two-scale recreations. We deliver joy by the pallet load. We use innovative techniques to bring high-quality products that are made in the USA. And they are as real as they are adorable. A real concrete, real wood, even real metal. Traditional dollhouse companies do Victorian molding. We do brief blocks. They do picket fences. We do jersey barriers. They do doilies and frills. We do moving dollies and pallet jackets. That's pretty good. We are not your grandmother's dollhouse company. We cater to a new generation of creatives who make art with fingerboards and action figures and RC crawlers. If your hobby is small, then we are the perfect fit. Now, Sharks, we don't like to make guarantees about gains, but after one day with many materials, you will be able to lift an entire pallet of cinder blocks over your head with one hand. So, Sharks, who wants to demolish a stagnant industry and make a big deal with many materials? That's great. Good job. Good job. Bravo. Why? Why does anybody need any of this? It's a toy. What are you talking about? Because people need joy. And everybody has some samples in front of them if you guys want to start playing. I'm here to answer questions when you're done playing with. Oh, that's so from someone who has had to wrap a lot of pallets. This is adorable. Thank you. When you said this is real concrete. Yeah. This is real. Yes. It's actually mortar. It's actually mortar. Yeah. So cute. Look, even a little buzz sock. 15 years, never seen anything like this. Super cute. How does it translate into sales? Give us an idea of when you started this and what occurred. I actually bought the business one year and one month ago. Oh, okay. So, the business has a lot to do with Reddit with the online form Reddit. Yeah. One of the original co-founders was looking on Reddit and somebody had handmade a concrete block and they were like, \"That is awesome.\" And so he started making them and then he put it on Reddit as well saying look I have this whole pallet with cinder blocks and people were like I love that. Went to the front page of our went to the front page of Reddit again. Dang. So lo and behold pretty soon they had a very healthy side business. I came across this post. Hey I have a business and I'm looking to sell it. So I reached out via Reddit and ended up purchasing the company from them. What did you buy the business for? 200,000. And where did you get the money for that Jared? So I took uh heliloc against my house. So wow you really you went all in. I did. I have been always wanting to start a business. What attracted me to this is it's making things. And what what are your margins on this? So on an individual product basis they go from 50 to like 93% with blended rate of about 75%. Oh that's not bad at all. What are your sales? So in the last year I've done $200,000 in sales. Good for you. Yeah. And you own it 100%. And you're making them? I make them. Yeah. How much does this sell for? Uh, that one without the logo printed on it is $20. And what does it cost you to make this? $4. That's pretty pricey. So, this is really for enthusiasts or hobbyists that are probably a little more mature. Is this for children? Really? Like, I'm trying to get the the the age like 8 to 12 is what my packaging guidelines recommend. What's the average? Um I don't know if I have a hard number on that that I would be 100% confident in saying I I do know generally. Uh so generally well what do you see on let's talk social media is that answer my question. Well because he doesn't know his demographic in that reason I'm out. So what do you do with social media? You know I could see this like doing a lot of stop action animation and stop animation. People do stop animation with things for sure. But are you doing any of that to increase sales? I am. But one of the reasons I'm here right now is marketing is my biggest weakness as a company. I'm not horrible at it. Tell us about your background. Uh I'm doing this full-time right now. I grew up in rural Idaho, went to a two- room schoolhouse. Uh and then after I graduated, I moved to Portland. I blinked and got up my first real professional job. Blinked and then was married. Blinked and had kids. Blinked and had a house. And life just was flying by. And this like desire to start a business was always there, but starting a business and not having sales just seemed slightly irresponsible for having kids and having a mortgage. I love how you said that. You know, I blinked and 15 years later, two words have never been broken. Yeah. Life just goes, \"You have a business.\" Are you making money on the 200,000? I am making money. Yes. Are you paying yourself? How much? I am paying myself. So, so far in that last year and a month, I have pulled out about 55,000 out of the business. Good for you. Good for you. You know, it's it's really interesting. I can see a forever perpetual demand for it from a very small segment of the market. Everything about it is small, literally. Yeah. And and that makes it a difficult investment for me cuz I mean, I don't know how you blow this thing up. It's just too small for me. Jared, I'm out. I'm sorry to hear that. I do think there is a lot of good upside. I think it's cute as can be. It's not a business for me, but I think it's a great business for you, and I wish you good luck, but I'm out. Thank you, Jared. I blinked and I've been here for 15 years. Um, what I've learned is if you have a good business, you can get it to 2 to 3 million by sheer willpower of your execution. You can make a fantastic living, but as an investor, I need to see more scale. I don't see it beyond that. So, I'm going to be out just for that. wish you all the best. So uh I think there is upwards of room for Jared entrepreneurs are willing to take the pain of working working to avoid the pain of looking back when you're 70 80 90 years old and never had tried. Yes. And so you get a ton of credit for going for it. I think this business can be successful, but because it's so new in inventing a new industry in a lot of respects, it could take decades, right? And I know that you don't want to hear that sound of it. That's a lot of pain. But I I just I'm not ready to go along for that long a ride. So, for those reasons, I'm out. Everybody loves the product. Love it. You just got to grind it out. Jared, it is very cool. Jared, you really have something here. And it'll never happen fast enough, but when you blink again, it could be a two, three, four million dollar business with a million dollars in your pocket. Yeah. All right, man. Good luck for Thank you guys. ", "Supermix Studio": "Next up, an original way for kids to express [Music] themselves. Hi, Sharks. My name is Jennifer Stein Bishoff and I'm from Brooklyn, New York. I'm seeking $250,000 in exchange for 10% equity of my company, Supermix Studio. Sharks. As a mom, I've witnessed the self-esteem boost that kids get when they pick out their own outfit. As a designer, I wondered how I could enable kids to create something that's a true reflection of who they are. Introducing Supermix Studio, the world's first interactive custom kids clothing brand. Our innovative platform empowers kids to celebrate their individuality by designing their own clothes. If a video game and a clothing brand had a baby, it would be Supermix Studio. Users can hyperpersonalize our clothing and accessories and create something that's 100% original. Just like Jake, who loves soccer and skating, nice, and Jasmine who loves tennis and dance. But Supermix is really all about the design experience. Let me show you. First, visit our website and choose a style. We have sweats, denim jackets, backpacks, and accessories, all made of sustainable materials. Then click customize now. Our design platform opens up and you'll find over 500 premium patches to choose from. Just drag and drop and place them anywhere you want on the style, the front, back, sleeves, and even the hood. Step three is our job. In our studio, we bring your child's masterpiece to life. As you can see, May is wearing the final product, just like the one designed on screen. Nice. Nice. And the best part, your kid won't want to take Supermix off because they're proud of it. That's the Supermix magic. Sharks, who wants to join me in empowering kids to express themselves by literally wearing their hearts on their sleeves? Ready, set, patch. Good job, guys. Good job, guys. Thank you guys. You're amazing. Thank you. Good job, guys. Thank you, guys. Excellent. Excellent. Sharks, in front of you, you'll find Super Mix that I took the liberty of designing for you. Oh my goodness. Look at this. Of course. All right, I'm in. It's really cute. Sniffle. Robert, you have our classic denim jacket. And what you're seeing there are our superized patches. As I mentioned, we have over 500 patches and we have over 30 of these large superized patches, which is really what everybody gets super excited about. It's really a cute idea. Very cute. This is really well made. It is thick. This is a jean jacket, but it's soft. Yes. And how much is it? What would this jean jacket cost? Sure. So, that jean jacket is $69. That's the base price. We're seeing an additional 15 to20 upsell in all of the patches per design. It comes that's an amazingly good price. It is an amazing price. What does it cost you to make? So that denim jacket is $1375 and as I mentioned it retails for 69. So the margins on denim are in the high7s. What about in the sweatshirts? The sweatshirt. So Damon, the sweatshirt that you have there is 705 and retails for 55. It appears that you're actually manufacturing the patches yourself. All of them. All of the patches are 100% proprietary artwork. I'm a designer. I've been in the industry for two decades. I'm responsible for generating billions of dollars in What companies were you with? Well, my first big job was for Gloria Vanderbilt. I was hired to launch their first ever junior brand. I would create a gene there that ultimately was written up as the hundred million dollar fit. Tommy Hilfiger saw that article and the next thing I knew I was sitting in his office and at 28 he hired me to be the vice president of design for Tommy Jeans to breathe some new energy into the brand. Wow. Jennifer, you're a real loser. Yeah. So, you have no experience going at all. My last role was as chief merchandising officer for a large scale private children's wear manufacturer. It took my entire career to finally figure out that kids is what I love doing the most. This is definitely the most fun I've had in in my whole career. What inspired you to say enough of the corporate world? It was the pandemic and my kids were home and I was just looking for things to keep them busy. We started tie dying and putting patches on things. I was like, \"This is so much fun. This is the white space idea that I'm keeping for myself. I love this.\" So, you're rolling out kiosks. Where would the kiosk be going? So, we're looking at taking these kiosks to all kinds of physical locations. The first people that we're testing the kiosk with is actually with Claire's. They're the premier destination of all things tween. Smart, but we're also looking at putting them in kids clubs at resorts and on cruise ships and of course department stores and boutiques. Okay. So, when you came in, I thought that this was you do this online, direct to consumer. I go to your website. That's correct. Yeah, me too. Is this now an expansion? Yes. But Jennifer, why? Well, because I'm a trend forecaster and that's how I've been successful in my career by doing things that haven't been done before. And this is an incredible instore experience. Everything's about retail tamement. What are your sales? I launched in October of 22. My first holiday season was $60,000. Okay. And year to date, we've done 110. So, it's 170 lifetime sales. You're not making any money yet, are you? Not yet. You're not selling the kiosk at all. You're putting them in stores, right? It's a very interesting relationship with our retail and venue partners. I hate this kiosk idea. Take your retail shackles off. Set yourself free. I am be reborn. I am reborn and I'm very happy to go into this from a DTC perspective, but we all know that customer acquisition costs are very expensive and they're rising and they're getting more and more difficult. This is customer acquisition. Yeah, but it's not. This is It's not. And here's why. Because we've gotten to the point now with direct to consumer where there's online and there's instore. And typically when you make the decision to go in store, it's the immediiacy of the product, right? I can grab it and get it right there. That doesn't happen with your kiosk. I think you're going to have people walk up to it and maybe put in some information which is great for customer acquisition and then expect it to pop out and you're going to get a lot of canceled cards because that product isn't right there. So, for those reasons, I'm out. Damon, what are you doing? I'm struggling. I I like I like this thing a lot. You know, this kiosk thing can either be a massive hit or a real problem. It's just too risky for me. So, I'm out. Jennifer, incredible quality, great price point. The sales are so low and now we're going into kiosks, but I still love it. I I hear your feedback about the kiosk, and it's certainly giving me a lot to think about. The people in the space that I've shown it to have been very, very excited about it. It's an incredible instore experience, keeping people in the store longer. Why do you pay the retailer? And the arrangement here as we're discussing going into Claire's is that they will receive 30% of the revenue driven from the machine. That's fine. It's a win-win. Ultimately, I'm holding the inventory and fulfilling. So, all they have to do is put this kiosk in their store and then it's it's 100% incremental volume. I'm telling you, this is the next massive children's brand. Imagine it as the Build-A-Bear of apparel. Let me take a stab at it. Okay. You're very impressive and I really believe in the demand and it all came to you during CO 19. But before CO 19, you got a different virus. It's called retail 19 and it's it's running through your veins even now. You can't let it go. It's 30 to 40% of your margin forever. It's a curse. But she's selling online. She's about to do retail, which I hate. I'm sorry. I'm out. And and don't come too close to me with that retail 19. I mean, that's just me. Listen, I actually think you're pretty brilliant. Thank you. I think that you think out of the box. You're an innovator. You've done something completely unique and different. And I think it's super smart. I see this for Disney. I see this as in places where you have the mom and the kid. They're a captive audience, right? It's empowering and it feels empowering to me. All right. So, okay. We're going to make you an offer. I don't know. We're going to figure it out. I mean, honestly, I've never done a kids clothing line. Oh, we're going to do a kids clothing line. So, at this point, yeah, while you're on to a great thing, it's still pretty early. We're going to offer you 250,000. We want 25%. We'd also like a royalty because we think a cash flow of 5%. Until we make back the initial 250,000. After that, it goes away. 5%. And then it goes away. What a bad deal. Well, you can negotiate. I mean, Mark, you're not putting up any money. Mark is not in this deal. I do not find that a bad deal in today's market. Capital is completely dried up, particularly in your space. The fact you have an offer goes to your credibility in your past. Even though you are infected with retail 19, obviously, it's really important for me to remain liquid and to be able to grow this company. So, I'd like to counter at 20% and 2% royalty. I'm sorry. I just can't. All right, Jennifer. 250,000, 20% equity, 3.5% royalty. Lori, I'm good with that. Are you? The royalty goes away after you're paid back. Correct. You have a deal. Amazing. Thank you so much, Lori. Congrats. Well done. Great presentation. Thank you so much. ", "The Fidget Game": "[music playing] Hi, Sharks. Welcome to my classroom. My name is Brandi.

Sharks, when I was a teacher, my\nstudents who struggled to read were frustrated and embarrassed. I watched my students turn\nfrom confident learners to thinking they were stupid. So I decided to gamify\nreading in my classroom to make it fun and stress\nfree, and the results were astounding. My students who once\nstruggled to read started devouring books\nlike hungry sharks. And that's why I\ncreated The Fidget Game! My games are\nmulti-sensory, aligned with the science of reading. And they work! So Sharks, I know you're\nprobably nervously fidgeting, waiting for my offer. Here it is. I'm seeking a\n$500,000 investment-- You've got to be crazy. --for 10%-- Whoa. Now we're nervously twitching. Now you're fidgeting. A 10% equity in my company. Sharks, listen. Connect with your inner child. They are saying \"invest!\" Who is ready to fidget your\nway forward to a ton of cash and tackle the literacy\ncrisis with me? I can't wait for you\nto justify that number. I'm so excited, Barbara! I have to-- [laughter] Barbara, I have to\ntell you something. My entire company would not have\nhappened if it wasn't for you. What? Well, I'm happy to hear that. I came home one day and my\nhusband completely shocked me. And he said he\nwanted a divorce-- Whoa. --out of the blue. I fell into a very\ndeep depression. And I was laying in bed--\nthis is a week after he left-- a TikTok video pops up on\nmy phone, and it's your story. I've been in business\nfor 13 months-- That's all? --and I've done\n$3.2 million in sales. What? Wow. - Are you kidding me?\n- Yeah! Yes! Are you kidding? Wow. [music playing] ", "Bunny Eyez": "[Music] so I've got the arms down I get that and now I'm like this correct okay so you all know it's a patented hinge we have two utility patents what's been a response we've had a really tremendous response lifetime to date sales is over $5 million a little over I didn't expect that how did you sell $5 million yeah so we started selling them the summer of 2018 okay how much you sell in 2018 a little more than $600,000 first year wow okay 2019 1.9 okay 2020 1.3 okay what happened there the last couple years have been downwards we had 700,000 in the next year and then last year a little more than 4 00,000 all right guys what what are you making them for and what are you selling them for our cost of goods landed is about $3.7 the case is another 60 C and we sell them for $35 and $40 margins are you selling this primarily direct to Consumer on your website are you selling through Amazon as well yes do you have any other investors we are self-funded we have zero debt and we did recoup our initial investment after year 1 that's the only monies we've taken out of the killing it I mean well done this is a very mature industry and and we have seen all kinds of ideas and eyewear over the last 15 years of Shark Tank we're all educated and we know there's a behemoth out there that provides all of the frames for everybody everywhere all of the time have you gone to them and said look you have distribution everywhere you provide an oem service to every brand in the world you know exactly I'm talking exactly we've had a had a your question yes or no are they interested in licensing it in discussion we're in discussions and that yes and I was going to say to you Kevin cuz you're the licensing master that that was one option it sounds like you've already talked to them I don't think you need very preliminary stages but we had we had one preliminary conversation look guys I'm not your shark I appreciate it I'm out okay look part of the challenge to me is you know when Hodo wears them these TV shows people watching linear television are trending older so it's a great match for what you're doing social media maybe some on Facebook isn't as strong a match it's really interesting it's really cool but it's still just a reader at the end of the day and it has to be demonstrated to the age appropriate group that needs readers right which isn't as strong a match to social media as I think you need to really get that momentum so for those reasons amount oh come on come on J come on Jenn I have to be honest with you guys I don't think you could sell it in the retail space at all I think you need someone to show it and that's a problem it's really the te going to be a huge Challenge and it's not one for me so I'm out thank you I agree with Barbara in a sense because when we said what you going to do with the money one was in store stands and it made me kind of go well this is a thing we want a part to work with us no but you know you overestimate what a shark could do we're your financial partners we give you guidance but I think you sounded to me like you're looking for like a working partner yeah and and and so going back to that but I think going back to that I'm interested [Music] m ", "TIK PIK": "Next up is a solution to an annoying problem for guitar players. [Music] Hey Sharks, I'm Nicholas George and I'm Kevin Mack. We're here seeking $75,000 for 10% equity in our business, TickPick, the pick that sticks. Now, before we get down to business, I'm sure you're asking yourselves, \"What exactly is a tickpick?\" So, Kevin, I was thinking maybe you could sing them a little song. Well, hey there, Sharks. I like playing guitar, but I'm always losing pics in them honky tonk bars. Don't worry y'all, I got the fix. All you really need is a pack of tickpics. See, before ticks, I put picss in my mouth. I drop them on the floor, I'd lose them in the couch. No one ever made a pick Kevin Matt couldn't lose. But with Tickpick, that's hard to do. You see, Tickpick has a real good grip and it feels mighty fine on your fingertips. Just put them on your guitar and they'll stay till you want to pick them up and you're ready to play with Tick Pick. Tick Tick. The only pick that sticks. Tick Pick Tick Tick. For $29.95, that'll get you six. Yeah. Good job. Good job, you guys. Thank you, Sharks. We have some samples out in front of you. You guys can all put them on the guitar. See how they stick. Kevin, play something for us. Well, Kevin, if you want, I got that electric sitting up there if you want to plug that in as well. This is actually the only thing that Kevin is Let's do the electric. Let's do the electric. Okay, let's do it. Let's do it, Kev. Give me some. There you go. Let's do Blues and E. Oh, come on, man. Give me [Music] something. Yeah. Get it, Jim. Go Kevin. Come on Kevin. Kevin. [Music] [Applause] [Music] Yes. Oh man. Great job. Good job. So Kevin was playing one of our guitar picks. What do you think, Kevin? So how do players feel about the the the raised pod of silicone? whatever that is. First off, I've been a guitar player for 25 years. I make a good living being a professional musician. I had a guy who brought me this pick, one of our partners, and he was telling me about this pick with a grip on it. I didn't care. When he handed it to me, I lost my mind because the thing is picks that are in the industry now, they don't have a grip. People are dropping picks. If a pick company tries to put a grip on a pick, it's not comfortable. So, that's what I liked about it. Then he stuck it to my guitar and I about passed out. I told him, I said, \"You've missed it. The grip is great. Sticking to my guitar with no adhesive or residue or stickiness.\" I said, \"That's the key. There's no residue on a good none. What about the sweat? Does it take away the stick factor?\" No, it does not. You can drop it in the dirt and pick it up. It'll get dirty and rinse it in water and it's brand new. What's your background? I got a crazy story, man. I used to work back in Virginia Beach with a lot of hip-hop artists who were from Virginia Beach who helped me get into the studio and learned the studio which I played a hip country music. Would that be Timberland and those guys? Yeah. So Timberland and Miss Elliot and Teddy Riley. Then I played shows with them. Met a guy big producer. He was like, \"Kevin Mack, you're dope. You're great. Moved to Nashville. Here's a publishing deal.\" My wife moved back in with her parents. I got in a truck, moved to Nashville, slept on a couch for two years. And my wife believed in me for it, man. I said, \"Oh, I was gonna cry on this show. She's gonna kill me.\" But she she believes in me so much. And she I said, \"Give me two years. Let me give it a swing. I don't want to be 70 years old going, \"What if, right?\" And I said, \"But if it works out, you come to Nashville and we've been there for 8 years and we got a three-year-old little boy out there.\" Good for you. And through the community I built there, record producer who's done so much for me. His name is Keith Tagal. And that's how I met Nick. You can tell. So, I was born and raised in the Cayman Islands. Hey, I got East End, baby. Yeah, East End. My father's a career musician. 50 plus years singing in Cayman on the beach. Blondhaired Calypso singer goes by the Barefoot Man. The Barefoot. The Barefoot Man. Oh my god. My wife like just like just goes nuts. That's my father. Oh my god. My dad I've always been Barefoot's son. So, I never wanted to get into music though. I always wrote music. And during COVID, my daughter said, \"I think I might want to be a musician like grandpa.\" And I said, \"Well, let's go make a song.\" And in the process of doing that, I wrote a whole album. And in that process, he just mentioned Keith Stagal. We met through Keith, who's been a friend of my father's. And we became friends. We hit it off. So guys, who said, \"I'm going to put two silicon pads on a pick.\" We have a third partner. There's actually five of us in the business. Five owners. Like a herd of ticks in that, but we need six to fill the pack. Yeah, we need six. So, he was searching for the best grip and and came across this nano suction material and when they brought it to Kevin and I in the first place, it was it's a really good grip and we just went right past that to sticks to your guitar. I buy that it's a better product. Tell us about the sale. Absolutely. So, we've been selling since October of last year, barely eight months. We have a total of $60,000 sales lifetime. We sell a six-pack, which is our main product. So, that has either one of each of the gauges. is we do a thin, medium, and a heavy gauge. Or we have a multiack. And that's two of each gauge in the multiack. What do you sell it for? What does it cost to make? Your sharks are going to like this. It cost $244 landed for six of them. For six of them in that pack. $29.95 retail. $15 wholesale. And Nicholas, are you making any money? Did you make any money on the 60,000? We're expecting this year to have about 120,000 total sales. And we expect anywhere from breaking even to about $20,000 in profit. We sell primarily on our website and on Amazon. We also have four music shops that we've been able to get as wholesalers so far. And our split this year we're estimating to be about 85% direct to customers and about 15% wholesale. So guys, how big do you think this could be? So the entire pick industry, I can tell you without naming names, one of the biggest manufacturers of guitar picks sells tens and tens and tens of millions of packs of picks a year. So what is an average cost of a pack of $50? So, you have to be a committed guitar player. No, no. I've had a company talk to me about wanting to put it in new guitar players. They love it for the student. They love it for the guitar player coming up. You know what my mom hated most of all? Picks in the dryer, pics in the couch, the dog eating a pick. I know you guys are like in guitar center at all. Have you tried? We tried to reach out to the big box stores and their response has been when we get the demand, we'll give you a call. Okay. So, I love your name. Tickpick. The pick that sticks. It's great. Thank you so much, guys. Let me let me short. Let me finish then. Wait. No, hold on. Hold on. Honestly, I don't know how big this can be. Yes, sir. But as someone who tried to teach themselves guitar, I was sitting up all night teaching myself chords. I see the value of a good pick. So, I'll tell you what. I'll make you an offer. You have five partners. I'll be the sixth partner. $75,000 for 16%. For 16%. I'm a shark. I know you are, man. You're a good guy, too. Yeah, you're a good guy. Yeah. Thank you for the offer, Mark. Can Does anyone else have any other offers? Are you waiting? Yeah, I'm not waiting. Not two. Yeah, you got a deal, Mark. Okay. I was waiting to see what happened. Good one. We're going to have fun. God bless you, man. Guys, thank you all so much. Give us a song. Hold on one second. Hold on a second. Well, hey there, Sharks. Let me tell you how I feel. Mark Cuban, we're so happy that we got a deal. [Music] Thank you guys. Appreciate it, guys. Congrats, guys. That's crazy, bro. Awesome. I think there would been a bad taste in my mouth if he tried to just beat us up. And he didn't. His offer was fair for the amount of money we're asking. And you know, where we're at now, he understands we're just getting started, but he sees where we can go.

Texas and I'm seeking $250,000 for 10% of my company growing up my family shared with me the richness of my African Heritage including African beauty secrets growing from the shea tree in Africa this nut produces what we all know as shea butter and boy did I love this moisturizer so it's no reason my aunt in Nigeria persuaded people traveling from her Village to pack tubs of pure shea butter to my family in Texas and when I say tubs I mean this beauty right here wrapped in cellophane fancy right for sharks this thing is Magic inspired by my own hair her itage I took this little gym and turned it into 54 Thrones standing for the 54 countries in Africa we partner directly with African cooperatives to create our line of clean beauty products while promoting trade not Aid our products are decadent and divine from our Glow Body Oil to our Moroccan body mass and our awardwinning African beauty Butters 54 Thrones is here to celebrate the beauty the luxury the romance the motherland has to offer offer so sharks who's ready to spread the 54 Thrones wealth with the world nice job great presentation there's some in front of me for you to try these are some of our best sellers what what should we try first my favorite is our African beauty butter in the Egyptian lavender and Moroccan mint scent so that would be the you got to tell me what we use these things for right so our products are Universal you can use them from hair to toe the beauty Butters are our best-selling hand and body butter Christina they're very oily obviously that must be by Design so they're are butter right which is different from lotions many people are used to water-based lotions and water actually draws out the moisture in your skin but Shea Butters and other Botanical oils they seal the moisture into your skin you don't need much you don't need much exactly K I think I used too much you probably did you need a towel okay let's dig into the business itself so when did you start this give us the background yes so we just turned 5 years old last month and it's been a long journey I'm a first generation American my father immigrated here from Nigeria he was a janitor he was a cook all this while in school to be a CPA he always taught us to have pride in who we were have pride in being Nigerian and and just have pride in ourselves and so I went to school I have two masters I went to tand University I have an MBA and I also have a masters in healthcare administration wow good for you so I worked as a consultant for a few years and then I quit um I had this calling that I wanted to learn more about my Heritage I wanted to learn the language I wanted to learn my history so I quit my job um I didn't quit my job to just start this business but I quit my job because I just I I had a calling right I cashed out my 401k and I just started traveling around Africa and while I was there I was just drawn to all of the makers the hardworking women making Argan Oil making shea butter and so I tagged along with them I learned about these African beauty secrets and then I said you know what I want to start a brand and I want to work directly with everyone that I've met what are your sales so last year we made a half a million dollars and that is with a very tight marketing budget last year I spent about $8,000 in marketing that's it wow that's it a lot of our traction came from Word of Mouth we also were on Oprah's favorite thing so that tin that you have in front of you was part of Oprah's Favorite Things what were your sales before Oprah we had our already hit about $300,000 in Revenue okay um and a lot of that kind of comes from the things that were happening in our society last year black owned Brands were getting a lot of um attention people were finding them and loving them and loving our products so it really wasn't a matter of they're not being worthy black owned brands people just couldn't find us we didn't have the resources to are you are you seeing that being sustained at all absolutely um I have found people that found us last year are repeat customers we have people that are stocking up on our stuff and so we're on set to make a million this year wow we're actually going to be launching in Sephora we're going to be launching online in Sephora US and Canada and this holiday season we're actually going to be expanding to Nordstrom are you selling direct to Consumer as well we're selling DTC on our site last year we were at 75% DTC and that's counting the Oprah's favorite things this year it's going to flip we're going to be at about 25% DTC and about 75% margin to support the retail channel so the butter set that you have in front of you that cost me $12 to make and I sell it for 80 wow wow you sell it for 8 good margins you know I cannot fault you for anything today you did a beautiful pitch there's only one problem for me I got to be passionate about everything I invest in I'm just not feeling that I'm out Christina CHR

statistics around infant mortality and how a ton of these diseases can be avoided by just washing your hands with soap and that's how we came up with the idea of soap and we went on to win the challenge and use the prize money to start R&D and make soap a reality congratulations thank you so tell me what are your sales so in lifetime we've done $85,000 in sales uh we launched a beta version of soapen in 2019 at the time we hadn't raised any funding and had no marketing budget so we were definitely very lost but we got an article in Real Simple Magazine in October of 2019 and we had no idea what the power of print media is we sold out of our entire inventory in it was 5,000 units that we sold out in 3 weeks so you had that print you got a blip in sales are you still selling so that really validated the demand for the product which was not something we were sure of early on and then it gave us the confidence to go out there fundraise and we got a ton of product feedback from that first beta version and then we took that money that we raised how much did you ra so we raised $225,000 had a 1 million valuation we just closed it that's a lot all right what is a cost and what is your cost so it's $14.99 for a pack of three manufacturing a single pack of three is $430 our Blended profit margin across all channels is 40% how are you selling it what are you doing to Market and sell your product so we've been running ads on Amazon right now it's only been two months so it's so it's very hard your return on ads spend it's we're still determining that it's it's been two months so we have don't have a good number yet well that means it's not good or and you don't want to tell me because two months is enough time one day is enough time you have to make sure you're getting that return on ad spend otherwise that money disappears like that particularly with the categories you're in and let me point something out okay a product like this which has Merit okay I'm going to give you a lot of credit for what you've built here because it's a new iteration of of soap for children that is really appealing I get it but what's missing in your equation all right is an understanding of the sales process and how you get leverage to do that and reducing your customer acquisition cost somebody should be pounding out content every day to the algorithm set by TiK ToK by Instagram Twitter every day because you want to get these customers for free really Savvy marketers do that with products like this and I don't think you have that nailed down yet so for that reason because I think you're too early I'm out look guys you're not too early but you haven't found a way to sell it yet I would get on every message board on Facebook every group I can find on next door and everywhere posting pictures posting videos and telling them about your product that's a 24x7 by 365 job yeah you just have to eat sleep and breathe it and it be relentless this is not you know an investment for me so for those Reasons I'm out but I think you've got a great product but you just got to get out there and be relentless look I I couldn't admire and respect you more I wish you all the best but for now I'm out listen ladies you've done a great job I mean you're just out of school and you create a product that is a better M strap so to speak that's the best inventions are things that are just something smarter than what already existed but it's just too early for me as an investment I wish you could good luck but I'm out Lori kids need this right now especially with the pandemic so you know we finally you have one shark left near off right here oh well guys there is so much to like about you just listening to your story and even seeing you struggle up there it reminds me of being an entrepreneur and trying to sell in fact little known fact I had a company in between my first success and next door and I pitched it to Mr Cuban over here and he treated me not so differently than some of the sharks are treating you a lot of good advice but ultimately it wasn't right I think it may be a little too early for you to take on more investment my advice to you guys is to find some mentors and continue to iterate I believe very deeply in you guys but for those reasons as an investment I'm out thank you good luck guys luck good luck guys it's a great product thank you thank you they were great they were great and I love the product I love a great PR super super smart I think I made a mistake they're down there somewhere just go down there and get [Music] them you got a lot of good advice out there around I'm so I'm so sorry to interrupt hi guys I'm I'm sorry to interrupt let me run something by you my beautiful wife megat toia for the last s years has been working as an executive on the method Mrs Meers and Eco soap Brands so I think the two of us together my wife and I could really help you get this thing off the ground so does that sound like something you want to consider what do you think is this a joke okay it's not a joke it's not a joke but let's admit you're very early and there are lots of things that need to happen and so here's the way that I think about it I'm happy to put in the 100,000 I would like to have 10% of the company however for safety what I would like to propose is a $1 royalty that pays back $1 per unit sold until I reach $200,000 at which point the royalty goes away you have nothing else that you owe me besides the original 10% and I'm doing this not just because I believe in soen I'm really doing it because I believe in you guys and I want to see you succeed that is our offer and I hope you accept it if you don't not a problem well take let's do it all right you so much you can't wait to meet your life ", "Tabby": "[Applause] next up is a way for people with common interests to find each [Music] other a hi sharks I'm Nathan and I'm Sterling and I'm Lee from New Orleans Louisiana we're seeking $300,000 for 20% equity in our company Tabby sharks you may not believe it but these hands some men have been ripped to shreds on General dating apps all because of something they love cat here are real messages these successful passionate guys have gotten on General dating apps my friend says you have four cats that's four red flags H do you sleep with that thing would you be willing to give up your cats for me studies show that men who have cats in their profile photos perform worse and get fewer matches on General dating apps that's why why we created Tabby the cat person's dating app all right boys go be yourselves Tabby is a safe space Tabby is a familiar dating app you swipe left or you swipe right on people but it also has a specific area asking you about your cats like how much do you spend on your cat a month or does he or she sleep in the bed with you every night of course she does all my cats do tabby also provides a community space for everyone on the app the cat tree where you can share your favorite catf friendly cafe or suggest dating ideas like volunteering at Sterling's nonprofit or curling up with me and my four kitties in a nice bottle of wine so sharks say goodbye to these local adoptable kittens for now the boys will be right back and join us as we help people determine who they want to spend the rest of their nine lives with based on their love for cats with Tabby Lee it seems crazy to me how did you come up with this idea well actually I started a different dating app a few years ago I first started dig the dog person dating app after growing that with my sister for a few years we are now in acquisition conversations with a dog food company wow over those few years we heard from a lot of cat people one of the things we learned was that there aren't places like dog parks for cat people to go out and meet each other and there's this stigma around cat people that's terrible are the rest of you guys doing dig also uh no we're strictly here on Tabby uh both of us actually work as social media influencers I work as Nathan the cat lady as you can see by the cutout behind me and then I met Sterling at one of the cat conventions and we kind of headed off I go by Sterling trap king Davis trap king named after my cat rescue nonprofit I am one of one cat rescue is usually something done by middle-aged white women I am the only black man that you will see that sold everything and lives out of his vehicle and rescue cats good for good for you how many cat owners are there in the first place great question 17 million single cat owners in the US a lot of people don't know how many cat people are actually out there cuz most of us are ashamed to come out with it I am a cat lover I do not understand why there is cat shame at all why is there cat shame I I have no idea cuz it's not cool Lori oh is so not your cat so cool Statics when did you get started how many people are using the app what have you learned so far so last summer we had the opportunity to launch tabby because we won the million dooll dating project what is that it is a grant from a dating platform company and they gave us $50,000 in equity free grant money to be able to market the platform and we could use their platform put our branding on it then Market from there we launched on International cat day on this pre-made platform of course you did when we launched uh there were a massive amount of problems on the platform oh good I hate when that happens yes when we first launched that platform had all of the development made we brought our branding they built something that was built to the web and wasn't exactly made for mobile and it's uh you know we we went into it okay you gave us the excuses now get to the numbers okay sure we had 31,000 users on the app we made $43,000 in revenue 177,000 of that was from subscriptions and 25,000 of that was from our first integration partner and then since then we've not been marketing as we've been building out the next version of tab and are you still on their platform what I wanted to do was come to you guys today and tell you we want to switch to a new platform that urgency increased entirely in the past few days when they terminated our contract early oh good it is hitting the since then because of all the issues especially we went out and we sourced the best team we built an entirely new app with our new development team okay well that's great so but when are you ready to release it's already already under a review by Apple right now so it should be whenever they're done in the next two weeks is it a monthly subscription yes it's $1 199.99 a month and it goes down $999 well is that expensive or not in the dating industry right now that's not extraordinarily expensive pry aage regular um premium subscriptions how much money have you raised to this point for Tabby we've raised no money other than the equity Grant see to me that's the problem right because you had to funnel everything and do everything on this other platform for $50,000 that's impossible and now here you are scrambling as n will tell you and all of us will tell you growing an app is difficult competitive and really expensive unless you just find a unique Niche you know and maybe you guys can make it take off viry but it's really really hard and so for those Reasons I'm out look I wish you all the best anytime you can connect people and animals and create more love in the world it's it's a wonderful thing but it's not for me I'm out what we have right now is the car the keys the map the drivers we need the rocket fuel to be able to take off right you got no gas and you got no money for gas we would love some money for gas look we all love the passion but I will tell you from starting next door and growing it to over 50 million registered users it's very very difficult to get distribution you need to find a way to break through the noise of all those existing dating apps and make a name for yourself I think you probably have a long way to go to really build a breakthrough Tech app and for those Reasons I'm out let me take a stab at it this way I invested in a deal called Bas paw at a 2 million valuation we're raising 10 million at a 40 million valuation now and she has built a huge database of cat owners we may have the largest cat database in America and I have become a cat lover because it has cash flow I love cash flow cat flow cat flow so here's an offer for you and this the way I'm thinking of structure wow did not see this coming I'm going to offer you $300,000 for 30% okay it may be better if you had maybe America's biggest cat database on your side that's my offer why does that that's a good offer guys you're starting from scratch here that's a great offer that is a great offer would you consider doing 25% and meeting us in the middle no is my answer the problem for me is I'm not really a tech app app expert you know that's not really my background or my thing I don't have as much to offer I hate saying this because Kevin does have that company based pause where I think could be helpful to you and so because I want to do the best for cats that I possibly can I will step aside for the cat hater but who can be the cat helper what a lot of noise I'm out thank you Lori Kevin's giving you cash plus distribution because a partnership with his company will give you traffic and that's the only thing you need when you start this company you have everything else Kevin it sounds like a perfect deal and we'd love to take it and work with you yeah there you go yeah yay that's absolutely fantastic thank you so let's have some fun with this thank you it's great nice to meeting you guys too a lot of social work to do here thank you so much thank you so [Music] muchi be one what I'm talking about baby let's go let's go this is wonderful Kevin I think you're really going to help her what I I see is you promoting the app with a picture of you with a hairless cat I want you to understand something I am building a cat Empire yes I'm the king of the [Laughter] litter ", "TheMagic5": "in the US and

Mark's offer Kevin o and guest shark Nev toia dove in to make a combined offer they offered $500,000 for 5% Equity plus $3 per unit royalty until they recovered $1.5 million they had the technology and marketing experience needed for the business so it was a good match on the other hand Robert hevc offered $500,000 for 5% Equity with no royalty because he understands the market Lori Greener believed they needed more sales which she is good at so she offered to team up with either Robert or Mark if they agreed but Mark refused however Robert agreed to partner with Lori for 6% Equity Kevin

[ Laughs ] ", "Copper Cow Coffee": "[Music] next up is a way to have a popular vietnamese beverage at home [Music] hi i'm debbie and i'm here today seeking six hundred thousand dollars in exchange for four percent my mom immigrated here from vietnam and even though i was born and raised in california make no mistake i was definitely raised in a vietnamese household and i loved everything about it i loved the food i loved the culture and i especially loved the sweet creamy treat of vietnamese coffee if you're not familiar with it it's just a simple dark roasted coffee that's paired with sweetened condensed milk and it is out of this world sharks nowadays people are looking more than ever for that coffee shop experience and copper cow coffee is exactly that our single individual pour overs allow for anyone to make a gourmet coffee without any additional equipment simply take your pour over open it up and grab your biodegradable filter gently hang it over your cup and then tear off the top and then pour hot water over the organic ground and immediately watch as your organic coffee drips directly into the cup and we partner with the best farms in vietnam to bring the absolute best vietnamese coffee to the us once brewed then you get to add your copper cow creamer and there is nothing else like it on the market there are no preservatives or additives and then stir and within seconds you will be sipping on your own perfectly balanced vietnamese coffee so sharks tell me who's ready to be their own barista tell us about what's in front of us yeah so what you have in front of you is a sampling of our selling products you of course have the classic which is what i just made here that comes with the milk and sugar but we also have it just black and then on your far right you've got our churro and our lavender they're natural infusions and trust me they're all delicious i gotta tell you you know this packaging is absolutely incredible and i i just came back from ho chi minh and i stood online two hours for one coffee shop now i learned how to die are you telling me that i didn't have to wait out there for two hours nope and you don't need to buy any additional equipment this is great why is it so sweet well we do sell it just black but we do find that most just like most americans drink their coffee with milk and sugar that's right that's the culture philippines vietnam vietnam that's the profile yeah it's actually normally much sweeter in vietnam like it's like a packs of pudge for sure so what's your story how did you come up with this yes so my background is is that i went to mit and berkeley i ended up working at the world bank in finance supply chain management and i wanted to do something that really was more creative something where i could go a million miles per hour during the last year at the world bank i did this on the side i was on the subway with a duffel bag full of samples selling door-to-door to get into our first 30 stores and you know was manufacturing living with my sister and making out of her garage when was this this was uh four years ago what i think is really cool is this i've never seen anything like it it's really clever this packaging yes did you create this yourself we perfected it in terms of exactly the brew that we want but it's actually a technology that's very common in japan and so we're the first people to be bringing it over and how much does this sell for fifteen dollars for five servings and it costs us three ten to make it so it's premium cost of premium coffee so i took it to the fancy food show and i was chosen as the innovation of the show and so we got into a thousand stores that month what year was that 2017. so total sales to date is four million and four million billion a hundred and seventy thousand okay and then in 2018 we make 500 000. okay then and then in 19 we make 1.6 million year-to-date year to date is 2 million wow tell me the margins now now we have a 70 margin wow so you're doing 2 million dollars here today right yes so what percentage of that is online that's eighty percent online okay so that's true you've evolved from being retail which is good for you now retail we're still on retail that 20 is that that's from a growing number last year when your sales were 1.6 million how much money did you lose we lost 1.4 million 1.4 million did you get an outside investment in 18 we raised 2 million how much cash do you have in the bank we have 1.5 million did you raise more money margins story markets we did we did raise more money oh there you go so the existing investors um invested another 1.5 what was the valuation 15 million 15 18. yes what you're asking today yes that's insane so personally like i like very very weak coffee and i love to get behind what i do a deal with but the packaging i don't think conveys what this is about it says pour over set if i walked by this in a store i would have thought it was some type of glass that's why i think that the digital is working for you and the stores not so much so i love the idea i think you're smart as can be very cool but i'm out you seem to grow in plateaus you seem to get to a point something happens you raise money you're at that plateau how do you get right what's your secret sauce what's your secret sauce what's happening now is that you know we've grown a lot like this past month we made 350. and i with again with a really really close to breaking even how much you think you'll lose this year um we'll probably lose around 700 000 which question is it okay to make money every year which one what i'm really excited about in the next phase is that you know we made 250 000 online last week okay what did you make in profit from that so we made about 120 000. so the real question becomes your next six months what what are you going to do in revenue and what are you going to do in profits in the next six months we plan to make another 3.5 million in sales in sales and then we were planning to make 500 000 profit there there you go so that's what it'll be that'll be the first time first time so i have to pay a 15 million valuation to see if maybe for the first time ever this four-year-old business can go cash flow positive right and that's really common though with a consumer packaged goods business you've raised a ton of money burned through quite a bit of it how much do you still own of the company i still own 40 so you've lost control of it through these raises right technically yes you know debbie um this is a very expensive bet that i'm not gonna take i'm out [Music] debbie you want me to you want me to b you want me to tell you the truth yes this amazing right thank you lost seven hundred thousand then lost another couple of million have a million point four in the bank you burn through all that money and you go well that's very common in a startup what would the everyday person say about that right now they say go make some money yeah i think the everyday person would say i just lost my job in my house the everyday person might say to you you got 1.4 million in the bank what are you doing for others right now instead of asking for more money right yes yeah yeah but damon that is so unfair my belief i don't care it's not even a belief you want to lose 1.4 million give it to me i'm cool with that right what about the flip side she's trying to create jobs she's trying to bust her ass make money flip side she's burned through enough to give to enough people to create others no one should ever start a business david that is so unfair i don't care if it's unfair that's my belief socialism you know what when i started with my goods i didn't have a million dollars i didn't have ten thousand dollars look no no no i'm not i'm not questioning your belief what i'm saying care about what they say i'm out all right okay well david i would like to just like reiterate that because they're so caring debbie there are some companies that need to make money along the way i'm with damon 100 but you know i'm in tech most companies in tech have to start with a lot of investment it takes a while to break even so i get that i mean i think i think you're the real deal thank you so i'll make you an offer i'll give you the six hundred thousand for eight percent i know it's aggressive but it's what i feel comfortable with look the challenge of this horrific covet period as an investor is as trends accelerate in this case going to online you don't know what demand is organic what demand is temporary and so because i just don't know what the demand drivers are for those reasons amounts what about four percent plus 1.5 advisory shares i don't care how you get me to eight percent five point how about 5.5 to mark's point my gut tells me you're on to something but there's so much uncertainty right now so i'm pricing in the element of risk that's why i want the eight percent [Music] i would i would love to take your offer done all right awesome thank you thank congratulations thank you guys thank you debbie great job i took robert's offer even though it cut my valuation at half because i really think that he's going to bring so much to the business in these times even though we're on track to being profitable we always want to kind of know what's the next thing and i think that someone like robert can really help us think that through and also really help us with a lot of the marketing opportunities that a shark can bring to a brand like ours a lot of entrepreneurs think i'm going to start a company and the first thing i have to do is raise money that's wrong they failed to learn that's what happened here well no a lot of people think just by raising money they've accomplished something it's not an accomplishment it's an obligation that doesn't always work exactly i can't sleep if i lose a dollar of somebody else's money i don't like the casual it's okay burning a couple of million to launch a brand she is not that is so disrespectful she's putting out that is 100 i don't have a you haven't oh my gosh you put four years old sometimes you got to spend money to make money i know it's a cliche you put your mind you put your money where your mouth was and i agree with that i respect what you did you ", "The Original Stretchlace": "next up is an accessory that makes shoes more

we have created a must have product to enhance the fit function and fashion of tie shoes traditional laces are restrictive you have to tie them every day sometimes multiple times a day and on top of that they're boring give your shoes an affordable lace over with the original Stretch lace the original Stretch lace is a stretchy lace that elevates the function of your shoe by turning your tie shoes into slipons let's see if David could slip into his boots and back into his sneakers in less than 10 seconds David are you ready ready sharks will you help me give him a countdown 10 9 8 7 6 5 4

in yep you just lace them like standard laces we have a little bit of room at the top tie them and then you just slip your shoes on and you're saying because they stretch you can just slide in and out and exct yep oh it it's very easy to do oh my gosh it really works yeah it works how much do you sell them for how much do they cost $9.99 to$ 13.99 and they cost anywhere from $149 to $214 wow great margin and would I find your product on the country's largest online retailer you would and would I find it on your website as well yes anywhere in retail uh we are only going after um online break down the numbers for me last year was $221,000 this year we're doing $165,000 however there's a little story to tell so I left my job in July and we started to see this really nice healthy uptick and growth then Corona virus hit the states and we saw a slow decrease then the countries that I Supply from were also hit by Corona virus so we didn't have any inventory and are you in the company too no so um I help keep the lights on I have a full-time job I'm in technology I've been in you know 22 years in technology you're a couple yeah we're husband and wife married uh you know providing financially for the family I'm working full-time then we have three kids which is a lot so I do everything I can when I get home or off work to give her the bandwidth because she works tirelessly this woman has put so much Sweat Equity into this business I can't even measure it how did you come up with this why I started the company I have three boys and getting ready in the mornings was crazy I was tying three pairs of shoes and I was thinking to myself what are they walking through at school that I'm touching these every morning and it just kind of ruined my day I went to the market to see what was available um and I have a 20year background in e-commerce I kind of know the lay of the land in terms of product um and so when I looked at the market I found product with locks or clips and I have three kids they're going to be rough and they're going to break them and they're going to lose the clips and it's going to be a mess so there were no stretchy laces that tied in then no there weren't no how long ago was that Jamie that was 3 years a little over 3 years ago and just last Ju July I left working for another company to pursue this what was your job at the other company I was managing an Amazon business that was about $35 million in Revenue in the health and beauty category for that company you management of a $35 million brand and then said hey I can take those skills as to do it for myself so now what I'd like to see is how have you applied that because the numbers for a person that has 20 years of experience and that run a $35 million business they're not amazing when we first launched the business I was working full-time so I have been doing this on nights and weekends and really I really just left my job working full-time in July I would say something that I think I'm super proud of is the fact that we got on to the largest etailer Amazon and we're able to take a significant market share from those other brands that have been around a lot longer than we have I think I did better in terms of becoming an expert on how to grow this business on that platform when I developed this product we researched what was going on on Amazon in terms of the search the keyword volume the relevancy when somebody looks for stretch lace knowing the Amazon algorithm knowing that they're searching for laces stretch elastic and that those those titles were in our key words smart right she in my eyes has a PHD in Amazon Jamie I'm struggling you are a 20year Amazon goddess selling a $13 shoelace I'm out okay guys look no disrespect for you when I say this you are shoelace cockroaches I can't work with you I'm out Jamie um I somewhat disagree that necessarily the shoelace is the wrong vehicle but I am actually concerned about you as an entrepreneur maybe you're a great manager but do you have that ability to be resourceful to be a Hungry Hunter to observe and and to turn and twist I don't see that entrepreneurial Zeal and for that reason I'm out okay thank you I can tell I mean you have that fire right you are an inventor entrepreneur there bumps in the road right and you're doing a great job and so I think you're going to get there I just don't think this is the right product for me I'm sorry I'm out sorry to hear that yeah you know guys I think you're better without an investor right now if you add an investor you go from just what can I do on Amazon on my time okay maybe I can get this done as a family you can get this done to okay Mark time to and obligations there so for those Reasons I'm out okay good luck guys and congratulations thank

the custom technology it's a web app um it was actually built by his brother who's a full stack developer over the last 6 years um but essentially it just does so much of the automating for our

you come up with this so I grew up in a family of two High School teachers and education was highly valued but when I decided on Wake Forest University $70,000 a year wow I was looking at over $100,000 in student loans and I always knew that when I got to college starting a business would be my path to Financial Freedom so when I got to college I noticed it was Gap in the market I also had a bunch of friends that were looking to make money and I kind of combined the two needs together we went door too getting made fun of every single day but by the end of that year we served 64 customers had $118,000 in revenue and that's how storage I just wanted to hear so you went in with this huge $100,000 plus debt you were going to graduate with you started a business while you were at school sir and paid off all that debt absolutely yeah wow and I came in a year later um I had a very similar story I was trying to pay for both my undergrad and then I eventually had Big Dreams of going to medical school so he said why don't you come work for this business opportunity that I have so I ended up working a lot I worked 106 hours in 7 Days unloading trucks until 4 in the morning

didn't exist so just joking with the guys hey guys I wanted to just get a six-foot Trophy and I wanted to ride it in like a pony and just show you guys how much I obliterated you all but since it doesn't exist I have to start my own app but I I don't get why that doesn't exist I have ordered trophies for my business my whole life every type of trophy why couldn't you use a regular Trophy House

we came on of the scene we were the first company where we had the ability for someone to change the colors on the Fly change the got did you design it we designed everything so what are your backgrounds professor of mine gave me invaluable advice he said Matt if you want to be a really successful entrepreneur you need to get into supply chain and Logistics to really figure out how businesses operate and how they function and execute so first job out of college I took a job at a freight brokerage I Rose was at the top of the company in 2 years wow I was the number one salesperson in the company brings up a good lesson for people whatever you're doing be the best at because once you're the best at something every door opens up and then you learn where you can be a great entrepreneur so good for you for focusing on being great at what you did absolutely my background is completely the opposite I come from TV and film doing Entertainment News TMZ how much did you invest in this business to get it going we we invested $250,000 wow that's a lot of money why do you have to invest that much to get this going what is it you spent your money on so in the beginning we started small initially it was a $60,000 injection um and in the first 3 weeks of getting into the fantasy football draft season sold out of everything what's the average cost the average price is about $150 $160 what does it cost you to make it our average profit margin is 80% 80% can you walk through the revenue growth first year what you sold what you made yes so uh year one January 2018 we uh we did $850,000 revenue and year what did you make what did you make on the 850 we the first year we had about a 200,000 net that we just rolled right into inventory and next year 19 year two uh 2019 we did $19 million wow okay you made what on that we had 775,000 uh grow gross profit and we netted around 500 and this year what are you going to do year to date so in spite of the pandemic our uh revenues year-to date are up over last year we've done $650,000 in Revenue so far the opportunity for us is a lot broader than fantasy so corporate Awards employee recognition youth there has to be a ton of competition in that space a ton there's a reason why no one in the trophy and awards space has really taken a national approach on e-commerce the traditional way of building trophies is is crazy the assembly process in our first year assembly was more expensive than cost of goods the way that we developed our columns the assembly time was cut down by 90% now I get it you're a logistics guy yeah everybody else in this space can't do what you do because anybody else would take years to get up to speed to where you are correct yeah okay guys so I I really respect people who play sports people are sports fans I kind of respect them fantasy guys so let me tell you a story I was trying to date this really hot woman and I realized she never had a date on Sunday cuz these morons was so busy watching sports so no matter where I was at in the world I would make sure that I got to New York on Sunday to take out this smoking hot woman and I remember her telling me you know I really don't like guys who like sports cuz you know I I'm alone on Sundays and I said said I will never watch a sports game my entire life if you marry and I married now so that's awesome I'm out thank you guys look I'm going to make you an offer I'll give you $600,000 for 25% of the business and my value is to try and work it into the corporate Market which isn't that easy well wait a minute wait a

Boulder Colorado we are asking for $500,000 for 2% in our company ouch wow who doesn't love sipping on an ice cold craft beer am I right but the reason why beer lovers everywhere aren't making their own beer at home is cuz it's not as easy as it looks no it takes tons of time experience expertise and the worst part is you can spend weeks on a single batch of beer and it can come out terrible that's why we've revolutionize the craft beer making process taking home brewing out of the basement and turning beer lovers into beer makers introducing beer maker beer maker this is the world's first all-in-one countertop craft brewing Appliance that anybody can use all right sharks Aaron and I are going to quickly walk you through a demo of this product just to show you how easy it is to use first thing you do is you take your maker kit you connect the bag into the machine open it all up pour in your grain The Next Step you do is basically fill the entire machine up with water close it all press the button on the front and over the next 24 hours beer maker is going to bring up the temperature inside the machine mashing those grains in liquid and creating War which is a sugary liquid next you get a notification on your phone and it says it's time to pit your yeast so open the machine back up you pull out that basket of spent grain you then put in your yeast you put in your hops close the machine back up press the button on the front and again over the next 5 to 7 Days beer maker is going to perfectly control the pressure and temperature inside the unit finally when that process is complete you get another notification and saying it's time to tap your beer so you remove the bag of clean fermented beer bring it over to your beer tap which is included in the package simply install the bag of beer inside the beer tap screw in the CO2 cartridge that comes inside your maker kit and about a day later you're drinking cold carbonated fresh delicious craft beer that you made yourself wow it was 9 days till I got a beer right it depends on the recipe so each each different type of problem with that yeah no no no I mean it's craft beer Kevin okay is worth $25 million so before we jump into the valuation question do you guys want to drink some beer yes and another question how many beers will you get out of it so beer maker makes a 12-pack of beer and the maker kits themselves cost $15 so starting at the lightest that's her future IPA that has a little bite to it it does I like it thank you so the next up we have our ghost wheat which is a classic American style wheat beer so next up we have our Redwood IPA and That's a classic West Coast style IPA I'm going to give this IPA a 9 out of 10 awesome thank you and the only reason it's not a 10 is the arrogance of your valuation we'll get to the air promise we'll get there Kevin now we're on chubby Kevin they named this one after you that's chub the chubby Stout I really like this one guys how did you get into the business the first place so first and foremost we love beer I was a home Brewer for 15 years um and you know honestly we we met at Cornell um Brett and I were in the business school together and we started the company in an entrepreneurship class at Cornell and it was for home brewing temperature control devices you're Cornell mbas yes sir so break down the numbers for me sure so this cost us $375 to make and it retails for cost you 375 for Allin all the pieces y including the first one batch of consumables delivered to your home and you sell it for $4.99 how can you sell it so cheap there's no that's no margin so we have we have two revenue streams one is replacement of consumables and all that what we want to do is we make sure is we get as as many machines out in the public as possible and build up we'll go into the consumables ex yep yep exactly so the consumable side of things it cost us $9 to $10 per um ingredient kit at scale we can get that down to $7 per kit is it subscription just reorder we're encouraging our users to go into a subscription system okay what's my monthly cost for subscription $15 per 12 pack what is your retention rate of the subscriptions so we're not there yet I mean you're not selling any of these yet so we are shipping them litera dudes I'm going to punish you we did our kickstart in 2018 and we're delivering those 1,200 units in the next two weeks how many of you shipped so far we've shipped about 24 of them so far so I should pay a million bucks per unit you ship I just like to point out had you shipped 50 then you'd be worth 50 million how much money have you raised we've we've raised about $3 million so far valuation depending on the round between 5 and 10 million just makes no sense to me you it's like coming in and asking us to believe in the Fairy Godmother you have virtually no sales you have $3 million put into it already uh and you have no proof of concept even I I must be missing something basic but I'm out we did have some proof of concept when we kick started we sold a thousand of these things in one month um and this is and like I said deled them nor have you gotten the feedback honestly you know to Barbara's point the problem for me here is everything tasted really good but because you haven't had that in consumer's hands and I don't know what's going to happen I can't invest at this point I'm sorry I'm out look what you what you're setting out to do is right on sure the the challenges your margins because you're going to have to to Really retain people and I think that's going to be a lot more expensive and even if the valuation is in the realm of where you're at it's going to be hard to generate enough profits to give me a return and so for those Reasons I'm out well to address those particular points address it with other sharks am let me let me tell you this first of all one one piece of advice is when you come in tank you have to make it attractive for us to make some money yeah when you come in here and you say 500 ,000 for 2% five of us got turned off so for me valuation very competitive and we don't know what we don't know for those Reasons I'm out Kevin I'm a reasonable man and i' like to give particularly for entrepreneurs that at the end of the day the product is excellent you have not heard anybody say this beer isn't great absolutely and I consider myself a connoisseur of all things with alcohol in them my my inner instinct is to eviscerate you but I'm not going to do that because so interesting so how do I encapsulate this ridiculous valuation but still be a partner with you now let me show you how to do it no royalty at all no royalty I just take what I do in the wine business and apply it here $500,000 it's debt I'll do it at 9% told you 36 months straight debt which you can afford if if you believe your numbers okay and I want 4% Equity you can figure out stay out of the cap table give them to me's advisory shares I would do that deal and you should seriously consider it because you're not going to get a deal from anybody else there's an offer what do you want to do well would you be able to go for 2% with the debt I'll do it at three I'll meet you in the middle I have an MBA too unfortunately we're really worried about the working Capital implications of that I don't want to fight with you about valuation we're never going to agree so okay let me give it a crack $500,000 and 9% is $3,750 a month you guys feel you can cover that that's not that's not a lot of money we yeah we could cover that the problem though is after we're done paying that back we have had to pay back $500,000 plus 9% over three years that's why yes right so in which case it's we're still now you have a partner that millions of people know and trust in these beverages if you don't want to do it don't do it I'm afraid that we're not comfortable with the de that's okay I'm out all right first in the tank is a product that brings all the conveniences of your kitchen to The Great Outdoors [Music] hi sharks I'm Taylor I'm Ron my name is Kobe and we're from Grand Junction Colorado and we are seeking 250,000 for 10% of our company that will revolutionize the outdoors forever have you ever unpacked your campsite and realized you forgot something important like salt oil or a spatula does your pick cable look like this well ours did we were so sick of disorganized camping it was frustrating so we came up with this idea that there has to be a better way which is why we created tailgate and go tailgate and go is a portable modular outdoor kitchen and dry box that you can take anywhere camping fishing tailgating any Outdoor Adventure it starts in this simple box most of our attachments fit inside the [Music] Box the modular design enables you to put the attachments in any 10 locations around the Box this patented modular design enables 360\u00b0 of function and versatility oh wow wow it has everything you need from your your kitchen at home even sinks nice tailgate and go is a one-of-a-kind product there's nothing like it in the marketplace but in order to be a success we need your help to reach our full potential so sharks let's all think outside the box and start an outdoor Revolution good job guys really cool really cool how'd you come to invent this we went camping we're sitting there searching for a spatula for 30 minutes we're arguing so we finally just said hey let's go home and invent this so we get home and just all the Ingenuity just came really between the three of us of what do you need a necessity in your kitchen how long ago is this one year so this has only been on the market recently year and a half wow how much does this go for retail well there's three different models the first model is the full-size model and it costs about $1,000 500 oo W our second model is the Overlander and it sells for around 1,400 oh and we have a brand new model and it's about 1,000 how many have you sold we have sold over a 100 boxes we've only gone to six trade shows what is it cost you to make so for our full-size model $748 to manufacture our second model costs about $728 to manufacture and our River box costs $500 to manufa faction and where do you make these everything we make is in Colorado right now so two questions one what does it weigh 75 lb on the large box 55 on the small box okay and then we have new products coming where when they're in plastic they're going to be much lighter so what does it cost to ship that then uh around 120 150 do you have any patents we have two patents they're both provisional utility patents on the railing here how we can put everything in in the slots on aluminum and what's most important Rotom mold plastic Guys these aren't cheap to build particularly when you're starting and making mistakes and iterating how much money have you invested have you raised any outside Capital no so what we did we took our savings we got two I got $250,000 invested in this entire process we're real tight with the money and one of the reasons we're here is because we don't want to make a mistake at the first of the product why is this business worth $2.5 million you know I have to ask that question and I'm doing it in the nicest way if I don't like the answer then things get ugly with the patents that we have there is no other product like this and I feel we have this window to take over the whole outdoor I don't think I like that answer enough we need to scale this puppy we need to scale it fast and what is the 250 going to be used for inventory product before you said you could bring the cost down by going to plastic including the entry level unit of a th000 so is that you're bringing that down to what price point yeah our cost on that is around 748 we can bring that down in the 300 200 range so you're retailing it for 7 SC we scale in Source SC we're completely in Colorado right now so we could get those prices down even in America I'm you know being in Colorado is not a bad thing but first let me say this you know there's an old saying necessity is the mother of invention yes you guys had a problem you came up with a solution you turned it into a business you saved your money to be able to do it yourself without any outside help right you are the American dream I mean that's incredible that's the good news right the bad news is I don't glamp it's it's just not a fit for me so for those Reasons I'm out but congratulations guys it's just awesome awesome awesome what you've [Music] accomplished you know I don't know very much at all about tailgating I always like to kind of know what's the landscape before I invest in something that's so at the beginning stages and so for those Reasons I'm out in the last 6 months we've tripled our sales we haven't even gotten out there yet you know I I look at this and say the proof is in the fact people bought it but you're not worth $2.5 million so that was a big ask I love the patent stuff and all that this is a cash flow business in other words it sucks up cash as you build inventory so here's an idea I'm just throwing it out there this kind of fits in my my chef Wonderful World although I hate camping if I don't have a mint on my pillow I don't sleep there that's how it works you need a line of credit here's an idea you can consider it I'll give you the 250 line of credit I want a 10% interest on it I want the 10% Equity that somebody buys you out and I want a $100 royalty per unit against the 250 I don't hear any other offers Kevin didn't give you the fine print the royalty is forever know that guys I could blow this up so big on social I'm just worried you can't do the orders I mean I got millions of followers well that's why we need sh I know let me just a jump in I understand this Market I have the ability to talk to the customer that you're targeting because I'm Vice chairman of Miami Dolphins I spend my Sundays at NFL games we have the largest privately owned soccer tournament in the world and I know how to talk to the Sports customer that you're looking to go after what concerns me is that when you're looking at Avid fans they are so vested in their own set up that I'm just not convinced that there's enough customers out there to make that a very big market and for that reason I'm out oh ooh Matt I think this would be perfect for you we could take this to the college football levels to NASCAR because people love their tailgating as you know and when they have a custom box that's whatever football team that you like that's a pride thing they live it you know what you have the gift and the curse of I think what all of us have up here as entrepreneurs when you first start out you want to be everything to everybody and when you say there's nothing else out there in the market that makes you want to keep improving it that think you're going to burn a lot of capital trying to keep improving and that's where I'm scared so I'm out to me I think you're actually just here a little bit early I mean if you had validated a little bit deeper then there's still Mr Wonder only believed in you we're going to take it to the end we just wanted some help scaling sourcing distri Hing that that's why if we would get a shark today that says okay let's make this happen and say to my offer basically in a nice way I am saying no to your offer in a nice way then there's nothing more to do [Music] here respectively can I just say we've worked our asses off to get here every day working so hard so just my dad and being here with my brother I'm so lucky yes I agree we've been working so much for so long towards this goal just to be here today it feels like we're Champions already okay thanks for your time guys congratulations great experience very cool you did a great J you guys you guys could have ceded it doesn't hurt to ask four sharks are out the Johnson family rejected Kevin's offer of $250,000 as a line of credit for 10% equity and a royalty of $100 per unit sold of tailgate and go you guys could have counted it doesn't hurt to ask we would go 250,000 for 15% how do I get my cash back how do I get my cash back that's the question you're going to get your cash back as soon as we get these boxes Tri a Never End cost of capital as you grow I'm a shark I've been doing this for 10 years this business it will consume millions of dollars it's not a horrible thing if you can manage it but the thing you won't have just so we understand each other is you won't have me and I'm Mr Wonderful and I can take this on social to the Moon they'll be setting these up on the Dark Side of the Moon if I get involved but that's my whole point oh my Lord can we have one second can we talk we go talk yep you think you could sell this on the Dark Side of the Moon yes Matt so let me get this St let me get this stra everybody's out but Kevin but you're giving a counter to Matt okay Matt what do you think about $250,000 at 20% my concern is similar I don't want to wait to get my you know cash back is just sitting there hoping for an exit I'm not sure how big the business is going to be so I need a way to get my Capital back would you consider like a small royalty or something on each box royalty did I hear royalty to show you I'm not greedy I will cut my royalty down to $50 a unit which is very reasonable your margins are okay and then you have a deal and you have a shark and I get behind it on social and we blow it up but even if I get behind it I'm going to get you more orders than you like I see see now I feel like I have to go I have to save you here's what I'll do 250,000 straight equity for 20% I said we'll do $50 royalty until I get One X back and that's my best offer what how much Equity are you taking I'm taking 20% Pig I I don't think that is greedy it's outrageous I bring a ton to it you're stealing from this family I'm helping this family I'm protecting his family from you okay okay okay Matt let's do your deal let's do your deal yeah back out back in back out back in doing great did such a good job your PCH guys now Matt what's very important here is now that you've learned how to structure deals for Mr Wonderful I will be sending you an invoice that crazy that's awesome e ", "SneakErasers": "hi sharks i'm chris pablica from elmore ohio and i'm kevin console from for green falls ohio and we're the creators of sneaker racers we're here seeking two hundred thousand dollars in exchange for eight percent of our business as we all know it's important to look good armor knows exactly what we're talking about i like what you're talking about and for many looking good starts with their shoes that's right sharks people love the look of shoes with new white midsoles but they're impossible to keep clean we swear if you just look at them wrong they get dirty yeah so unless you want to wear a plastic bag over your shoes no one can tiptoe around these elements and avoid these disasters we knew there was just a better way which is why park's like what we created sneaker racers this is a unique dual sided sponge engineered and designed specifically for shoes just tear open the pouch pull out the sponge and use the white side to easily remove all the scuff marks and dirt and flip it over the orange side to wipe it clean and best of all it's pre-moistened so you can touch up your kicks wherever you go it works on all kinds of shoes sneakers casual shoes sports cleats did shoes okay all right all right you guys get the point so take these bad boys with you and your purse your carry-on your computer bag wherever you want to keep your favorite pair looking like new like before a job interview or like before going on a hot date", "Grind Machine": "[Applause] first into the tank is a product that proves the old adage practice makes perfect [Music] hey sharks my name is thomas fields and i'm the founder and ceo of grind today i'm seeking 250 000 in exchange for 5 stake in my company now millions of kids each year dream of playing in the nba mark i'm sure you were one of them i was but whenever you get to high school coaches usually expect you to shoot up to 500 shots every day but usually this takes about six hours at a time and good luck trying to find somebody to chase down your rebounds mr wonderful it's not gonna happen that's why we created the grind machine the world's first portable shooting machine that captures your made and missed shots automatically passes the ball back out to you and collapses down into the size of a duffel bag within 90 seconds simply set up our shooting machine under any basketball goal and bam you're ready to lock in our shooting machine rotates 190 degrees manually pass into five positions on the court so you can train like a great athlete from anywhere along the arc unlike professional machines that are sold to the mavericks grind is made for the consumer being the lowest cost machine on the market today so sharks who's ready to help grind develop interactive game changing products one sport at a time mark you wanna try yeah love to now it's uh it's powered by pneumatics right so this is a completely new way of passing the ball out so if you can stand like right there that's about right [Music] oh oh he sucks ready sit faster there you go [Music] what is up with that rim i hope the league doesn't see this wow he does suck [Music] thomas what does it retail for we retail right now for 14.95 1495 1495 okay so thomas tell me a little bit about your backstory you wanted to be an nba player yeah absolutely so i grew up always wanting to be a nba player and ultimately get my family to a better means right growing up i saw my mom and my dad always you know working 5 a.m jobs night shift jobs so my goal was to get a d1 scholarship right and go to the nba just like all the other kids well i blew out my acl four times before i graduated in high school wow and wow i soon realized that that dream of getting to that next level was not gonna happen and throughout this whole process um i realized that i was knocking on the door at the gym at five o'clock in the morning trying to use the shooting machine that my school purchased that was six thousand dollars right and 400 pounds and i couldn't get in the gym it wasn't accessible to me at the time right i tried to buy one for our house and it was like five six grand so there was no way my family was purchasing one and at that point i realized that these companies are really overlooking the market so we came into the market for 14.95 and we're the first company that started payment plan solutions for for individuals how much money did you put into it to get it up off the ground fifteen thousand dollars and how did you earn that fifteen thousand thomas ymca shoveling mud everything that you can think of like i was putting it all all in thomas what are your sales uh we launched march 1st of 2020 so in five months we uh pre-sowed 215 000 worth of units so that was on a kickstarter no so we actually launched pure ecommerce on our website so what were you doing to get people to know about your product we started completely word of mouth and as you know i in in basketball it's a community where if somebody says something or there's a video out about it it goes pretty viral right right so all the kids on instagram who are shooting right they put this into an instagram video to show how they're working out all the kids that watch that think okay if they're using it then it's cool for me exactly i'm not clear have they actually been shipped and are being used or is this pre-order stuff this is pre-orders so everybody has paid us up front okay and we're delivering how many units uh 125 units and not one has been delivered yet right this is our testing unit we've gotten here with 215 000 in sales through a pandemic with no working capital all with one unit why cost you to make a unit 977 oh wow wow right so we have roughly 35 margins we think that at scale we could bring that margin down and what about power if i take it to the the park yeah and just want to shoot yeah what about power so how long does the power last it doesn't need to be plugged in but version two that's exactly okay so that's a challenge right yeah you know that makes it more for the backyard or the bucket you have in your driveway yep right and it really doesn't help you in terms of going to the park some some parks actually do have outdoors yeah yeah you'd be surprised how many do look i go out and i still shoot right because you're quarantined right that's how i clear my head sure didn't show and shooting those baskets yeah trust me that's a clutter your head i can shoot but you know there are other options that are low cost right so there's there's just the metal rack that just yeah you know if you're just shooting and it just rolls right back down that cost a lot less now every basketball player will tell you they hate that well yeah but i like fifteen hundred dollars more than i hate mark what do you guys have with the mavericks do you have something so let me give you the comparison right so if you're outside shooting by yourself it's gonna take about six hours to get up to 500 shots right in right versus our machine you can do that within an hour so thomas let me take a stab at this when i you know first saw the pitch and watched mark miss basket after basket i thought to myself you know this is a crazy idea without any merit but the more i heard the story and the fact that you actually sold over two hundred thousand dollars worth of them that is more impressive this isn't a product for me though i mean but we do have a token mba owner we keep on the side here in shark tank but i applaud you this is a cool product means a lot not coming from you when i'm out um listen thomas i think it's a great idea um i think it's very useful i'm just not a sporty girl you know so um as an investment it's not the right one for me so for that reason i'm out thank you thomas i i i got to tell you i love your story and it's so inspiring it reminds me of when i grew up a kid from the boys and girls club i think it's fantastic i love the name grind i love your grit um for me i'm having a problem with those margins and the price for those reasons i'm out thank you look the challenges right now one the valuation okay right yeah i'm gonna go to your margins and how many you can actually make and how many you can actually sell yeah i love that you know just grinding all your life that's who you are and i respect that what you've been able to accomplish is awesome um i'm just yeah let's negotiate mark let's let's let's figure this out because i think this can easily go to a five to ten million dollar company i'm not sure that's the question i'm not sure of that right i am i know what no entrepreneur doesn't think so that's right yeah absolutely it's kind of scary to sit next to him and he's not sure and he's not buying and i'm warning him no no let me just tell you the minute you walk out that door with or without a deal i'm going to buy one from my backyard he's not here [Music] three sharks are out and mark is undecided about thomas's basketball shooting aid grind look the minute you walk out that door with or without a deal i'm gonna buy one from my backyard he's not here for here are you going to make an offer because i would like to address it such a good item mark yeah thomas i think your price point is too high i think your product is too ugly all right if my neighbor put that in their driveway i'd kill them that's the truth so i don't know what you could do to make it look better but i think it's got to look better we're going we're going for a very mechanical well yesterday it looks mechanical but i'll tell you um i think you're a phenomenal entrepreneur you got the whole package i would like to uh make you an offer but i don't want to go in without one of these sports guys okay one because i want to use their money and two because they know what they do in the sports field and i don't so i'm anxious to see if what do you have in mind barbara so i'm thinking i would offer 250 for 20 percent [Music] that's not enough you don't think that's yeah it's not hold on i agree with my partner here mark he's going to ask you for more what do you think of mark so if there's two of us 30 okay i'll go with you i like your deal two of us because let me just tell you and i know you think it's a lot you know but it's not period of story right because barbara's skill set is her people skills and her ability with the marketing and packaging are better than mine i'm going to make it pretty yeah she'll make it pretty so 250k for 30 percent [Music] i have a i have a cap on myself right so it's up to you because it's non-negotiable non-negotiable thomas before you decide you have one of the greatest owners of the nba i mean this is a dream offer let's do let's do 25 for 300. i think the valuation is is great for you guys right i'm going to take it to a 10 million dollar company easily in two years right you think i i'll work my tail off right let's get it give him a sweeter deal because i have to be a shark 250k for the 25 percent you got to check let's get some 250 breathing room i just did right i just did 250k for 25 be careful now if you're if you're worrying about 50k then you're not valuing us thomas what are you going to do if you have to think about it thomas yeah let's do it all right whoa i thought you're going to walk away yay thank you guys love it good job all right thanks guys well done man i'm excited about having mark and barbara i think we're gonna change the world if you have a dream and you see me up here making deals like you can go do it no matter where you're from you ", "SwipenSnap": "hi

off and you pour the water in it it's really tight yeah you should feel it really tight and then we press the blue button yes and then you press the power button tell me how did you come up with this well i i work construction i'm a civil engineer so i was in the field with the guys in the winter and i live in indiana construction guys they're out there and the freezing cold and they had to go 10-minute drive to get a cup of coffee and come back to the site and that's like 20 minutes if you multiply that by 10 workers you're spending a pretty buck on coffee you know so my goal was how do you bridge in between having a coffee machine at home and in an office but when you're on the go in between those spaces your only option is to buy and i was like we could make something that could actually keep that self-brewing feature in coffee but people can now do that with our machine how much is it it's 120 retail and what does it cost you to make 38 do you have a patent yeah i have a utility patent pending for both the pods and the machine can you tell us a little bit about how did you go from ghana to indiana well i grew up in ghana at 17 i graduated from high school and i decided i would chase a career of civil engineering in the united states so i kind of kissed my family goodbye and i arrived in united states with two thousand dollars in my pockets um i arrived on campus in cleveland state and i ended up working a job um scrubbing toilets in the morning at 5 30 a.m to make money to keep myself going so what is your role in this you're a social media influencer so yeah a little bit of background about me um i over the last eight years have gotten billions of impressions and views and 45 over 45 million followers you look over here my 94 year old grandmother who's my co-star and we've been doing it together the whole entire time everything's with your grandma like not everything but she's my coach she's my main star so i have the ability to push products and push people and that's kind of why i'm in the company i'm marketing this is my brand i'm using my social media to back this i'm pushing it with all my might for the last the last week i got 100 million impressions just on my platforms well then let's get to sales we sold it on kickstarter um we sold 600 units in january did you deliver the kickstarter units yes we have you can tell it's designed by an engineer because it's all built around functionality yes as opposed to looks right yes it looks a little bit like a spaceship right yeah i always say it looks like a camera lens and that's what's missing you did how much in revenue on your kickstarter twenty-two thousand dollars just tell me your total sales okay forty two thousand two dates that's that's it yes that's what we did mr wonderful please oh my goodness are you kidding you think this is worth ten million dollars absolutely now i'm gonna rip your pieces are you out of your mind why would you think this is worth 10 million because just my my push alone i get 100 million impressions any week on my own you can buy them to do with that and i can sell i've already sold products i monetized your impressions are you thousand dollars worth no because we haven't done the push yet that was just to see if the practicality was good exactly i haven't even jumped on it's not a product last year on e-commerce it made 33 000. i brought it on 9 million this year single serve take it with you portable preserve the environment that's all good but like any product it comes down to the actual design like i started playing with it and there's just too many movie pieces that you had to explain you're asking for a million and you haven't really shown us anything to to say you deserve a million so for those reasons i'm out appreciate that appreciate that i think it's a great product horrible design but let's put all that aside for a sec because i love the concept i love you a million dollars for 10 the challenge when you ask for that kind of money in a 10 million evaluation is you've gone out of the world of belief and theory and now you're in the world of proof you have to give me proof that it's worth that it's ridiculous i'm out you know what it's still an early stage prototype there's still a long journey so your valuation and the amount of money you're asking it's just very hard and i'm actually like sad and upset because you have great energy i love you guys i'd love to be but you made it impossible for us so i wish you the best amount it's clever i think that always problem solution things are great but today you came in asking for a million dollars for 10 percent and everybody said sort of the same thing you guys a million dollars is so much money you can still do that is there is there a way to shift sadly thank you i you know i'm i'm offended at this valuation 10 million that's obscene that's ridiculous it's stupid and as a result you're going to walk away with nothing that's what and so it's your mistake not mine our goal is to have images i'm here i got a million bucks but you're not getting any of it zero or any from anybody else because of your mistake your greed your decision your strategy even with the rosco man there it doesn't matter it's a wonderful i i don't plan to pay myself for the next few years until this takes off the goal of this is not to be careful if you're paying yourself it's a million bucks anyways guys i'm out good luck guys congratulations thanks josh appreciate the opportunity thank you guys you guys have a great one thank you guys appreciate it the shots will definitely regret that because i do believe that not investing in us they they have lost a big deal they might not know it now but they won't know it in the years to come

want to be a really successful entrepreneur you need to get into supply chain and logistics to really figure out how businesses operate and how they function and execute so first job out of college i took a job at a freight brokerage i rose at the top of the company in two years wow i was the number one sales person in the company it brings up a good lesson for people whatever you're doing be the best dad because once you're the best at something every door opens up and then you learn where you can be a great entrepreneur so good for you for focusing on being great at what you did absolutely my background is completely the opposite i come from tv and film doing entertainment news tmz how much did you invest in this business to get it going we we invested uh 250 thousand dollars wow wow that's a lot of money why do you have to know how much to get this going what is it you so in the beginning we started small initially it was a 60 000 injection um and in the first three weeks of getting into the fantasy football draft season sold out of everything what's the average cost the average price is about 150 160 what does it cost you to make it our average profit margin is eighty

2019 we did 1.9 million dollars wow okay on that we had 775 000 uh gross profit and we netted around 500. in this year what are you gonna do year to date so in spite of the pandemic our uh revenues year to date are up over last year we've done 650 000 dollars in revenue so far the opportunity for us is a lot broader than fantasy so corporate awards employee recognition use there has to be a ton of competition in that space a ton there's a reason why no one in the trophy awards space has really taken a national approach on e-commerce the traditional way of building trophies is is crazy the assembly process in our first year assembly was more expensive than cost of goods the way that we developed our columns the assembly time was cut down by 90 now i get it you're a logistics guy yeah everybody else in this space can't do what you do because anybody else would take years to get up to speed to where you are correct yeah okay guys so i i really respect people who play sports people

", "His & Her Bar": "So, this is absolutely stunning. Donald Trump's own DOJ just made a filing in Washington DC talking about how horrific the January 6th insurrection was. And it also links terroristic threats against former President Obama to social media posts that Donald Trump made. Now, it should be noted that Janine Piro from Fox is the main federal prosecutor in Washington DC who filed this document. So, as Donald Trump has spread all of these January 6th conspiracies, Janine Piro, whether it's because of her oversight or intentionally throwing Donald Trump under the bus, talked about the January 6th insurrection and talked about Donald Trump's social media post resulting in somebody at the January 6th insurrection, thereafter committing multiple other offenses, including threats against former President Obama. Let's just go through this document. Now, someone may be losing their job at the Department of Justice in Washington DC. So, this filing, just so you can see, it was made yesterday, October 28th, 2025, and it's in a criminal prosecution of a guy named Taylor Franklin Toronto, who was criminally prosecuted regarding his role in the January 6th insurrection and then later committed additional crimes in 2023 when he returned to Washington DC and did multiple other acts for which he was charged. There was what's called a bench trial where he was eventually convicted of those crimes. And let me just read from this filing. It says the following. On January 6, 2021, thousands of people comprising a mob of rioters attacked the US capital while a joint session of Congress met to certify the results of the 2020 presidential election. This guy over here named Taylor Franklin Toronto was accused of participating in the riot on Washington DC by entering the US Capital building. After the riot, Toronto returned to his home in the state of Washington where he promoted conspiracy theories about the events of January 6, 2021. I wonder where he would get these conspiracy theories from. Was he promoting the conspiracy theories that Donald Trump was feeding him? So that was in this motion filed yesterday which involved a sentencing of Toronto because Toronto was convicted of his more recent crimes from 2023. And this was the sentencing memo where the DOJ is asking that he serve a total of 27 months in incarceration. This is coming from the government. So, it goes on this motion saying Toronto, he committed all of these crimes. Look what he did on January 6. Look at these conspiracy theories that he was spreading about January 6. Again, the Trump DOJ filed this yesterday. It goes on to say in this filing in June 2023, Toronto returned to Washington DC. He drove through the city and the surrounding region in his van and engaged in alarming behavior that targeted at public officials. His erratic behavior intensified on June 28th, 2023 when he live streamed himself and suggested that he outfitted his vehicle with a detonator. He made several statements indicating that he intended to blow up his vehicle at the National Institute of Standards and Technology. Now, it says, \"The next day, get this, on June 29th, 2023, then former President Donald Trump published on a social media platform the purported address of former President Barack Obama. Toronto reposted the address on the same platform and thereafter started live streaming from his van on his YouTube channel. Toronto broadcast footage of himself as he drove through the neighborhood where Obama lived in Washington DC, claiming he was searching for tunnels that he believed would provide him access to the private residents of certain high-profile individuals, including former President Obama. He parked his van, walked away from it, and approached a restricted area protected by the United States Secret Service. He walked through the neighbor the nearby woods and stated, \"Got to get the shot. Stop at nothing. Get the shot.\" After noticing the presence of Secret Service, he said, \"If I were them, I'd be watching this, watching my every move.\" He said, \"So, yeah, more than likely, these guys also hang for treason. I control the block.\" It then says shortly following his arrest, officers located Toronto's van and multiple law enforcement agencies responded to the scene, police recovered hundreds of rounds of ammunition, and they seized his backpack that included multiple firearms, a pistol, and other weapons. You see those weapons right there. Now, it goes on to request that he be sentenced to 27 months in prison, then 36 months of supervised release, plus 200 hours of community service. Now, take a look at who signed this. Janine Pro. It's also signed by other DC lawyers, Carlos Valdea and Samuel White. But as you go and read what I just read for you on page three, it's almost like they're saying Trump's a co-conspirator. They don't use that language. Let me be very clear. But it says the next day, Donald Trump posts the private address of Obama and this criminal by the name of Taylor Franklin Toronto who participated in the mob of riers attacking the joint session of Congress returns to the crime scene, goes after Obama, takes the address given to him by Donald Trump, and goes to Obama's house where he's intercepted by the Secret Service. us while he was live streaming this on freaking YouTube, the government's sentencing memoranda. Signed, Janine Piro. So, I want to point that out from the outset. Okay. Another thing I want to point out because the DOJ is in total disarray right now. a federal and and this bodess awful for Lindseay Halligan who is Donald Trump's former personal lawyer turned top federal prosecutor in the Eastern District of Virginia who was likely unlawfully appointed as an interim top federal prosecutor when she was not allowed to do that under the appointment clause because under the appointment clause there needs to the confirmation by the United States Senate. There's a statute that allows you on an interim basis for a limited period of time before confirmation to be what's called an interim United States attorney, but that's for a finite period of time. And if the federal judges in that district don't extend you on an interim basis and you're not confirmed in the United States Senate, you're done. And that's the only time the president can ever appoint someone on an interim basis. So you get one attempt, finite time. You can't then make a second person an interim. So as it relates to Lindseay Halligan, there was already an individual who was made an interim in the Eastern District of Virginia. That individual said there was no crimes committed by Comey, no crimes committed by Leticia James. So Trump fired that interim person, brought in Hallagan, said, \"You're the interim.\" And Halagan's the only person who signed both the indictments of Comey and James. Not a single other United States attorney or assistant or any federal prosecutor signed on with Lindseay Halligan. And that's why Halagan's going to be screwed.

Take a look at this ruling that just occurred where a federal judge said the Central District of California federal prosecutor, United States Attorney, interim United States attorney, a guy named Billy has been acting under his role unlawfully since July. A pretender, a fake, a phony United States attorney. Now what this judge ruled in the case involving Bill Asai because this was brought by criminal defendants who Asai was prosecuting. But in these criminal prosecutions asale at least had other federal prosecutors sign the pleadings. So even if you disqualify a sale and say can't be the federal prosecutor, which is what was ruled here, there are still other prosecutors whose names are mentioned. What the court says is you can be what's called a first assistant United States attorney, but you're not the lead federal prosecutor. So you don't have that title anymore. But the prosecutions in that case of the criminal defendants can go on simply because other federal prosecutors were on the pleading, were on the filing. As it relates to James and Comey, the only prosecutor on the filing is Lindseay Halligan. Lindseay Halligan can't be the United States attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia on an interim basis because Trump got one shot and he picked somebody else. and then fired that person. Lindsay Hallagan then went into the grand jury room all by herself with no one else there cuz no one else thought there were criminal charges that could be filed against Comey and James. And now get this, and this is going to be a disaster for her. The federal judge who will be hearing the Lindseay Halligan disqualification motion has ordered Halligan to turn over the grand jury testimony. So, the court's going to read that and all of Haligan's communications about how she became unlawfully, although the court hasn't said it yet, the United States Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia. If you're Lindsay Halligan, you are terrified right now before you go to sleep, if you can even sleep, and you wake up in the morning cuz that bar license, that license of you as a lawyer. I don't know, Lindsay. I don't know, Lindsay. You're about to be cross-examined by some of the top lawyers in this country. You're going to have to turn over all of those communications with Donald Trump. And it may have felt good, Lindsay, when you got those indictments against Comey and Leticia James at first, but who the hell knows what you even told the grand jury? Guess who's going to find out now? The judge. Lindsay, were you lying to the grand jury? Were you providing fake information about who person three was in the Comey indictment? Uh-oh. Uh-oh. Did you do that, Lindsay? And what about Leticia James? Did you say that her niece was paying for rent? That never really was happening. The only rent ever, it's like $1,200 that New York Attorney General Leticia James disclosed. Did Did Did Did you tell the grand jury something else when other grand juries were rejecting the same case? Did you lie to them and have an FBI agent in both cases provide incorrect information? Oh no. Lindsay Halligan, didn't you see what happened to Jenna Ellis? Didn't you see what happened to Rudy Giuliani and all these other lawyers? I think you're going to be joining them. Sucks to be you, Lindsay Halligan, but we'll watch it play out, but that's what you get. That's called karma right there. Also, more bad news for Donald Trump in the form of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in an Enbank panel. Anbunk en space ban cbank Latin the full ninth circuit they've vacated for now what that three judge panel did there was a three judge panel that include two Trump judges on the ninth circuit where they said as a relates to Portland Oregon Trump can bring those uh national guard troops there but the full Ninth Circuit said uh-uh we're putting that aside we're vacating that now the full Ninth Circuit onbunk panel is going to hear what's going down in Portland, Oregon. And all the Ninth Circuit judges are going to finally and definitively chime in whether Trump's invasion of cities like Portland, Oregon, where, by the way, a district court judge at the first level from Portland found what Trump was doing was unlawful, a Trump appointed judge. Then it went to a three judge panel, the Ninth Circuit, three judge panel, and two Trump judges, and another judge overruled her. And then it's now going to go to the full 9th Circuit Court of Appeals. We will keep you posted there every step of the way. And then also, it should be noted that a judge yesterday um uh issued a ruling blocking Donald Trump's attempt to terminate these federal workers using the shutdown as a pretext. So, it's US District Judge Susan Ilston issued a temporary restraining order against the Trump regime firing these government workers during the shutdown and saying because of the shutdown, we don't have to follow administrative procedures. And Judge Ilston talked about the human cost, the human toll the Trump regime is inflicting on these government workers. When Judge Ilston ruled against Donald Trump, she read the sworn declaration of Air Force veteran Sonia Crocker, who says, \"Prior to my current job, I worked at the Equal Employment Opportunity, and before that, I was a United States I was in the United States Air Force. During all that time, including during my combat deployment, I have never gone through anything as traumatizing as what I am now experiencing.\" And Judge Ilston wanted the lawyer for the DOJ here named Michael Velchic, who previously was known for praising Minecom when he was apparently as in a school project when he was in college and law school. Apparently praised mine comp to friends according to Forward and a bunch of other um uh papers, digital magazines, whatever. Um, Michael Vilchick responded to the judge when the judge says, \"The human toll here is something you need to figure out.\" And then Vilchick said, \"The American people wanted this, judge.\" And the judge says, \"That's absurd. What do you mean the American people wanted this?\" And the DOJ lawyer, Vilchick, here said, \"I mean the American people selected someone known above all else for his eloquence in communicating to employees.\" You're fired. This is what they voted for. This is what he said on the apprentice. Then the judge said, \"Eloquence of doing so. What do you mean eloquence of telling people they're fired and firing government workers? Are you saying to us that the DOJ's position here is that Trump was elected based on his eloquence of firing government workers?\" \"Yes,\" said Trump's lawyer. he's known for above all. I think this is what he's known for right here. And then the judge is like, or the lawyer arguing for the federal workers is like, that's utterly absurd. We'll keep you posted every step of the way.

workout right now all right hit me up later i'll be back if you gotta sit this is it [Music] now justin knows what he's talking about because this is our patented sit in motion technology it's like a chair within a chair and it rocks just like our sails now you don't have to have moves like justin in order for this chair to work for you because all you have to do is sit get fit and all 33 of your vertebrae well they're going to keep moving all day now this is a chair now mr wonderful yes you're looking particularly uncomfortable i am would you like to come up and i will see what we're talking about i i have a bad back from a squash injury oh well then let's see what happens make sure you get your uh behind all the way into the back of the chair scooch back there all right and you can probably feel the rocking motion move back and forth very interesting why is this making me sit up straight why is that happening so the the patents that we have about this are really quite unique basically dr dennis colonel who invented this he's been doing this for a long long time he's got 45 years of treating backs necks and everything else he figured out let's get your hips moving almost as if what you're experiencing is is a sensation that's almost like you're standing but when you're sitting it is moving all 33 of your vertebrae while you're sitting and there's nothing else in the world that is doing i'm very skeptical about all these claims on chairs because i've tried so many and i also have tried different devices to help my back this thing actually is working i don't care about bieber i'm going to kick his ass and when my album comes out i don't like your evaluation though well we can talk about that yeah i would expect that from you tell us how how did you get into this and what should happen so i have been a patient of dr colonel's for about 20 years and then friend i'm also a bit of a serial entrepreneur i got into making products and getting products sold along the way i got into the back care space when i sat on dennis's chair in early prototype i said this is a whole different ball game but i knew that dennis was never going to get this thing going as a friend i said let me help you i'm going to do a kickstarter for you so we did that it performed very well what's very well uh we did eight hundred thousand dollars that's very good that's great did you license it from him no no partners i own a small piece of it how much of the company do you own i own about five percent so a premium chair in today's market sells for roughly 2 000 a real premium chair what does this sell for we're selling this for 7.99 what's your margin what's it cost you to make so our margin is about 67 uh our cost delivered to a customer with all that good stuff is about 260 bucks two and a half percent 500 000 20 million valuation yep how many chairs you selling how many dollars so this year alone we've sold about 3.2 million we're on track to hit five and a half okay and what are you gonna make on five and a half so we were uh slightly profitable in the second quarter and we expect to be the same in this third quarter i mean just help me because you know i'm a quick study in most sectors office supply furniture or even if you want to call this high-end chair design whatever maybe it would trade for 11 times pre-tax cash flow i mean i'm not saying it isn't a great chair but it's a chair why is it worth 20 million dollars we are looking at comps for other companies that are out there in a very similar space that are three to four times revenue we know we're going to get there we have also talked to the market not my opinion 20 million bucks is a pretty good valuation so then why are you here why am i here have you talked to so many people that gave you that valuation why are you here because shark money is better than other money so you're charging us more than no your sales because we're sharks i'm prepared to give you a discount because you guys are sharp can you give a discount i am the ceo of the company and i'm here to make a deal you're a marketing company first and foremost you've got you've got your product right it's got its angle it's got its differentiation and that's good right i just don't want to be in the chair business sure you know it's just of all the businesses big and small not that there's anything wrong with the chair business but it's just not for me okay um so for those reasons i'm out that's fair thank you if you had come in here today and you wanted to sell me a chair you're the perfect guy but you weren't here to sell a chair you were here to sell a business you said you're a five percent owner correct i for some reason feel it lacks credibility okay i think that's a good lesson for other entrepreneurs you can't send a salesman in well with all due respect this is my life right now and to you know it's a bit of a degradation to call me a simple salesman on this deal barbara's very good at pissing everybody off well that's fair and you can do that but the fact is that's not is that is not what is happening here i'm here to build a company we are building a movement in a category that hasn't been done before we're going up against the big guys that you know frankly it's a fractured uh system that i look forward to breaking i wish i could believe that you're building a category but i don't see that as a category i see it as a chair with a new design element but it doesn't get me all excited so for that reason thank you the problem for me is whenever somebody comes in and they have something different that can really be good but they're just starting yeah and they want to get a shark i always feel the smart thing to do is to be a lot smarter about your valuation because if you get somebody in and alongside with you you could take a one-off item like this and blow it up which is what i'm good at sure so if you had had something that was just more realistic because you're i just feel it's so out of whack for me it just turns me off and for that reason unfortunately i'm out that's fair there's a competitor company that just had a 200 million valuation on you know higher sales i actually i actually work with one of the bigger guys um very desk sure and the whole uh theory is the desk raise up and the chairs that you know they sell are a little pole a chair so you have to balance yourself right um this would be a conflict uh with me so i'm out i started choking on the valuation and i'm still choking on it okay i tried the chair and it has merit but 500k for two and a half percent i don't get out of bed for two and halfers well uh bing i can't i'm happy to have you in a higher place on the cap table i'm just kidding you just squeeze your head like a teenage pimple and i feel like doing that but i don't want to so i'm out okay thank you very much i will buy one though well uh you're gonna have to pay full price this time i guess i will oh bam all right thank you bing to have barber just call me a salesman i think that was a bit offensive and you know i don't think any entrepreneur wants to hear that when you put your blood sweat and tears into something i find that particularly you know not cool you ", "Electra": "[Music] hello sharks I'm Fran Harris from Dallas Texas yeah and I'm seeking $350,000 in exchange for 20% of my company sharks the sports rink category is a 23 billion opportunity the problem is that a lot of these companies who are reporting to have functional hydration are actually putting water in bottles that are full of nothing more than sugar artificial colors and ingredients and you guessed it salt sharks consumers are not going to settle for a sports drink that overpromises and under delivers leaving you feeling tired and sluggish do you know why you know why because there's a new sports drink in town and she's got game introducing Electra a better for you functional beverage hydration company that's going to change the sport drink game forever sharks I played on an undefeated division one Women's Basketball team at the University of Texas I also played on the wnba's first championship team with the Houston Comets so safe to say I've consumed a lot of hydration and sports drinks and I can tell you without a doubt that everyday athletes Hustlers and doers what they're looking for and Electra delivers on every single one of those and yeah there's some competition out there but let me tell you sharks we are coming for that [Laughter] ass so there's really only one question remaining who's ready to Electrify their Hustle and the tyranny of the sugary sports drinks and help me raise this billion dooll baby great great are we going to try these yes you are going to try those so those are the three flavors there is ly lemonade there is Passion punch and there is oh yeah Orange passion punch is good is there a particular top seller so those are our launch flavors you haven't sold any yet good question Kevin already you're showing how wonderful you are um no we haven't sold them we literally just launched about 10 days ago wow okay what do you use to sweeten it we are using monk fruit to sweeten it the question that we will get to either sooner or later mhm is you mentioned a few competitors now they're not just ordinary competitors they are bone crushing monsters who own this category what is the plan for you to get distribution in the bone crushing business of sports beverages well Kevin you heard my background I'm not afraid of competitors y I've uh competed of you Kevin and um competition is a good thing the plan is to go direct to Consumer online shipping a 12 lb box that's going to be expensive let me finish the plan is to go direct to Consumer as well as to go to retail my background is uh I was a salesperson for Proctor and Gamble so I'm very familiar have a lot of experience in the cpg market so I get the freight I get how expensive it's going to be but I also believe that you have to go direct to Consumer because there are a lot of consumers online who are looking for hydration and we need to be there just like we need to be there at retail so why did you decide to go with a drink as opposed to a mix because once you are hustling and you're active you want to walk into a convenience store or a store and you want to grab something then right you don't want to grab a water and then grab your mix and then have to do all that but I think the convenience factor is a big thing and I get that it's just getting that space in the cooler right is hard and then trying to be direct consumer sure is even harder cuz got to be mixed direct to Consumer that's a 24 lb case 12 it'll weigh 24 lbs agree I I think it's important to be both I think it's important to be on shelf and I think it's important to have a mix that people can order online the shipping is going to be less if somebody who works out I always have to replenish potassium so the amount of potassium relative to the amount of calories is really good thank so that's a positive my challenge is though with the Mavs I already have two big deals with sports strength manufacturers okay so I can't touch anything at all but I just got to tell you the formulation is great The Taste is great but unfortunately for those Reasons I'm out are you working full-time on this now I am where are you manufacturing this so we manufacture it in a little place called Capel which is right outside of Dallas are you going to be using a distributor yes we actually just I got an email today from one of the largest distributors who wants to see a sales sheet on it because I dropped some of it off last week and what is your first production run going to be the first production run will probably be between 20 or 30,000 and where are you getting that money from we have some of that meeting and hopefully the rest of it will come from this little audience right here so you can't take that product in until you get the money from us right that's right good job Barbara Fran how would you spend the $350,000 could you break that down for me production will probably be somewhere between 20 and $30,000 okay in terms of r& probably 25,000 or something like that ,000 and the rest of the money what would you do with that so I would also hire someone for Logistics sales and marketing so first of all I love you because I love your straightforwardness and your strength and your confidence I would be Uber excited about you but the drinks themselves aren't really my cup of tea and so for those Reasons I'm out you're out thank you Lori you have very impressive background your pitch was Flawless there is no data on sell through here friend you are running and you want to take my $350,000 and experiment I do absolutely I do whether this can work or not you don't have enough data to do that I don't want to I don't want to discourage you but I also don't want to see you crash and burn confidence is not enough I hear what you're saying first of all I win all I do is win so even though I'm new in this category I'm going to continue because I know that I'm going to be able to carve out a niche place for electric and that we're going to win we are coming for that ass that's it okay all right any other category any other product anything else that kind of you know confidence would be very useful look I wish you the best I really do but I'm not taking this ride with you I'm sorry I'm out so okay turns out you're not so Mr wonderful thank you thank you for [Music] that Damon I don't want to agree with Kevin but I've had a lot of challenges with this area and I I just wouldn't be able to help you with this uh cuz it's just so difficult so I'm out okay thank you Dave Barbara it's just me and you it's okay I don't mind an that's a lot yeah I wish I hadn't come in here and pitched a beverage business uh I rarely agree with Kevin but I do it's the worst possible space uh the very first money I lost on Shark Tank was to a small company guy with fire in his belly great conviction right formulation named chill soda I lost that money in a month boom so it's a terrible space so for you to stand here and be so Fearless you're a hell of a Salesman when I heard that pitch there wasn't a single word wasted but I'm not willing to risk 350 I'll give you $100,000 cash up front a $250,000 line of credit but because it's a high-risk deal I want 40% of the business y who's getting that ass now Barbara I really really really appreciate that offer and I can't tell you this until we decide whether we're going to work together but I have some things that are in place you want to tell me now I should tell you now you think so I do have I do have a couple of Hall of Famers one is an NFL Hall of Famer one is an NBA Hall of Famer who are ready to come to the table to bring their influence to move this product not their cash both of them are cash both of them are cash but I told them yes both of them are cash so I told them thank you for hiding that until everybody was out see I wanted to see who was with me Barbara I wanted to see who was with me um and these are real offers that are on the table so I like your offer but not for 40% would you be willing to take 25% for the same deal and we have a deal I'll give you or I'll take 30% if you could bring those two big fish in with us and if not all bets are off so if I can't get both of them in you're out completely if you don't bring them in you don't get the 100,000 you don't get the credit line you're going to have to take a gamble yourself here but I think that's only fair because I'm taking a huge gamble myself so I'm not sure that I want both of them oh you're not sure that I want both of them I I can get both of them I'm going to trust you that if you could get the good one uh then yes I'll do that but if you don't get them you don't get anything you'll do what 30% Barbara yeah 30% you bring the big fish in and still the structure of my deal is the same $100,000 with 250 credit line you driv a hard bargain Barbara say yes it's a good deal yeah she has no choice she's dead what' you say Mark I just said de choice I always have a choice there's no choice when it comes to Barbara I always have a choice I love the deal and I'll take your deal Barbara you got it I wish I could hug you but I can't but let's go I I'll make up for it later all the hug thank you congratulations congratul thank you very much "}
