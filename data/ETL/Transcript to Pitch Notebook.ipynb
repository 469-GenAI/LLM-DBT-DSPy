Brightwheel is the mobile app for preschools, daycares, and families and we are completely revolutionizing early education. Now I believe all of us are parents here and I want to ask when you come home after a long day and you ask your kids what did you learn in school today, does it sound familiar? This is the experience for millions of parents across America every single day and especially for younger kids. You've been apart from your little human being for six, eight, ten hours a day and that is all you get. You know you want to be a part of their day, you want to add to the learning once you come home and you can't, it's gut wrenching. And on the other side, on the school side, it's no better. In addition to actually educating our kids, teachers are managing a ton of paperwork. Let's face it, they're actually managing parents and on top of that they're even running a business. The system is broken and Brightwheel is the solution. So let's jump in and take a look at how Brightwheel works. So with Brightwheel, teachers can easily check kids in from the mobile app, they can log activities and assessments during the day, they can send quick updates and they can even manage their business all in one place. And we're just seeing an amazing amount of photos every single day on Brightwheel and this is the reason you take it, you tag it and you are absolutely done. And now we're gonna look at the teacher app. So this is the teacher's room and we're gonna click on activities at the bottom here and this is all being done on paper today and so we've taken it and combined it and made it super fast and super easy. So we're gonna click on nap here and then we're gonna tag three kids that just went down for a nap. And the key about Brightwheel is that we're saving teachers time, you actually have measurably more time with kids every single day. And now we're going to flip over real quick to the parent experience. So let's jump to the mobile app. This is actually my little girl Serena and this is her day and as you can see I get a sense of not only what she's doing but what she's learning. And so when I come home I can actually have a conversation with her about it. My connection with my little girl is so much deeper because of Brightwheel and by the way in the middle of a pretty tough day it doesn't hurt to get a photo like this. Sharks, this is a unique opportunity to build a massive business that has a massive impact on people's everyday lives and that's something that we hear every day. So I hope you're joining Serena and our team in bringing Brightwheel to every preschool, every daycare, and every family across the globe.\"}\n",

We're here today seeking 75,000 dollars in return for 20% equity in our company. Two years ago, Buttercup moved out. As a mom, I was heartbroken. I decided we should take cake decorating classes as a way to spend some time together. Well, before we knew it, in October 2011, Wicked Good Cupcakes was born. We received tons of requests to ship our cupcakes nationwide. It was a big challenge though trying to figure out how to keep them fresh and intact, and that's when we came up with the idea of shipping them in a jar. Our cupcake jars are baked fresh daily. We layer them with homemade frosting and filling, ship them in gift boxes with spoons so they're ready to eat right out of the package. Basically, they appeal to anyone with a mouth. We're not afraid to work hard. Our days right now average 13 to 14 hours, plus mom's definitely getting her fair share of time with me. So which of you sharks will be the first to sink your choppers into our sweet deal? It's definitely a risk worth taking. We found that there's a lot of dough to be made from batter. Thank you.\"}\n",
