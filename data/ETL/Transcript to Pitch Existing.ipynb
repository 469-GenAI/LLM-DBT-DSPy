Sharks, in my 20 years in the U.S. Army flying helicopters, I was able to get a bird's eye view of the world's plastic crisis. I was shocked by the way other countries were disposing of plastic. Sharks, the plastic crisis spans across our cities, landfills, and our oceans and surprisingly one of the biggest culprits is the laundry industry. And so we decided to take matters into our own hands and we started Sheets Laundry Club to combat the plastic crisis. We did that by developing a patented eco-friendly dehydrated sheet of laundry detergent. It's lightweight, it's mess-free, it's easy to use, and best of all, it's 100% plastic-free from start to finish. You very simply take one sheet of detergent and you toss it in with your dirty laundry. At the end of a wash cycle, it leaves your laundry soft, fresh, and clean every time. It's more convenient than liquids and powders, it's more cost-effective to ship, and it is far better for our planet than mainstream alternatives. Sharks, it's obvious we care about the planet, so which one of you wants to get hooked on creating a plastic-free tomorrow?\"\n",

We're currently seeking 500,000 for 5% of our company. Sharks, America loves entertainment, be it movies, television, anime, or comics. There has never been more content than there is today, but there is still a struggle to find content and characters that represent the black community's historical achievements before slavery. That's why we created Black Sands Entertainment. Black Sands is one of the only successful black-owned publishing houses in America, and it all started with the flagship title Black Sands: The Seven Kingdoms. After 100,000 copies sold, we knew a legend had been born. Wow, our sales are phenomenal, but one thing that can take a one million dollar publishing IP and turn it into a billion dollar licensing and merchandising IP is to make it into an animated series. We are here to give black and brown creators a place to tell their stories and shine a spotlight on the rich history of our people. So Sharks, who is ready to join the Black Sands family? Okay, please sit back, relax, we're going to give you a little taste of the future of Black Sands Entertainment.\"\n",

            "Product='Kettle Grip' Full_Pitch=\"Hi Sharks, I'm Dan from Missoula Montana and I'm Andy from Locust Grove Georgia. We're the inventors of the kettle grip. Kettlebells have become increasingly popular and provide dynamic full body workouts that build functional strength and range of motion. However, kettlebells are expensive, nearly impossible to travel with, and take up valuable floor space. So I began thinking of a way to turn the dumbbells that I already owned into kettlebells, and that's when the light bulb went up. I made a rough sketch and I sent it to my best friend Nancy. He was impressed by my talent as an artist; it looked like it was drawn by a five-year-old, but I could tell what it was supposed to be and I loved the concept. Kettle grip is a portable dumbbell adapter that allows you to do all of your favorite kettlebell exercises anywhere you can find a dumbbell. Simply open the kettle grip, insert any dumbbell, secure the latch, and you're ready for your Kettle grip workout. Clever Kettle grip is great for swings, upright rows, overhead presses, flexibility, and range of motion. We are seeking a $300,000 investment for 10% equity in our company. So Sharks, who's ready to get a grip?\"\n",

            "Product='Wubble' Full_Pitch=\"Hi Sharks, we're Justine and Adrian the wife and husband team behind the Wubble. Today we're seeking a 250,000 investment in exchange for five percent equity in our company. Wow Sharks, we're here to get you hooked on crochet. Our company is we make fun simple kits that teach you how to crochet but instead of a boring pot holder you'll learn how to make adorable characters like here and Felix the Fred designo and Sebastian the lion. Each kit comes with step-by-step videos that teach complete beginners how to crochet. Our secret? We're not just a crochet company, we see ourselves as an education company too. We've seen that something magical happens when people learn a new skill, it's about confidence. So Sharks, who's ready to wobble with us? Super cute, super cute! What you have in front of you is both the kit and an example of the Wubble that you would make with this kit. And if you open up the pouch then you'll see our easy peasy yarn and then most importantly there's a card inside of the pouch that has a link in a QR code that brings you to our website tutorial our customers will follow to learn how to make that wubble. What is the age start for this? So most people look at our product and think that it's for kids but most of our customers are actually adults buying it for themselves. And what do you sell these for and what do they cost you to make landed? They're three dollars, we wholesale for 15 and we retail for 30. How do you sell them? Over 90 percent of our sales are direct to Consumer straight from our website. Why did you crochet in the first place? Before I started the Wubble balls to lead user experience for Google classroom and I spent the bulk of my career as a ux designer working on education products and I love my job. I was great at it, I was so great that they made me a manager and it turns out I sucked at being a manager. To take my mind off of work I started dabbling in all these other hobbies and crochet was one of those things and learning to crochet reminded me that I still have it in me to learn something new that I could try to become a better manager. And so that experience of really building back my confidence through crochet is why we started this. I want to share that experience. Are you still at Google? Oh no, no, this is a 100 percent full-time, full-time for both of you. Yeah, from a really young age I've been taught that success means getting good grades, going to a good school and getting a really high paying job and that's exactly what I did. So I became one of the youngest directors on Wall Street. I traded billions of dollars in equities but I wasn't any happier at the end of it than when I started. And when I began to realize was that I had spent all that time working towards someone else's definition of success and so I left it all behind to go and try and figure out what my own definition of success is. I knew from a really young age that I really liked helping people and then when we started thinking about crochet kits what's really neat about it is that it is that confidence boost. Sometimes as we get older you kind of stop learning new things, you start saying things like you know I'm too old to learn that and so what brings me joy with these kids is that they're a little confidence boost to remind you that you can always learn something new. So exactly two years ago we started this business, we took 200, we bought some yarn and we bought a domain name and since then we've done 5.3 million dollars. Wow that's incredible! Here in a date we've done 3.1 million. We assume that we've just stopped growing from this point on out we'll do seven million dollars this year. Okay your direct consumer which means you're doing a lot of online advertising so tell us what your cost to acquire these revenues are, what your gross margins are and what your net margins are? Yeah so we spent about 20 percent of our revenue on Advertising. Okay that's not bad, it costs us a blended cack of Sixteen dollars, the average order value is around fifty Seven dollars. Okay wow they order one kit or more than one kit so that's about two kids then you're making a lot of money so 86 percent gross margin, 32 percent net margin Lifetime and 38 year-to-date great margins. So why do you need 250? I mean you're killing it. We're here for three reasons, we're here for a licensing, wholesale and mentorship. When it comes to licensing when a customer finishes the kit the first thing they think is I need to get another kit and they start asking us where's baby Yoda? Do you have any Disney characters? Where are the Marvel characters at? Guys how did you arrive at your evaluation? Did you presented? We know our valuation is very low, it's low because it's very low because we are here to make a deal. We can learn so much from this group of people in this room and the way we see it we have two huge opportunities ahead of us. We haven't even begun to talk about wholesale but licensing and wholesale we think can drive this brand to the next level. We want to go to retail, we want to go to retail because they have enough margin. We've done a test order so now we get a little more about what the mission really is, is the basis or the mechanism for that learning in Your Vision always going to be crochet meaning is the next product that you have coming a non-crochet or some other form? Yes, the key to our business is the learn what we apply it to can change but right now we are 100 percent focused on so for the foreseeable future it's crochet kids exactly. I like the steel okay because it has something I love called Cash Flow and so I see it this way I think I can reduce your costs of acquiring customers by around eight to ten percent. Number two I can definitely help you with licensing, been there done that with lots and lots of Brands. I also think I can help you with some other interesting ideas in the fashion world with this stuff. Okay the Fashion World you want to hear the offer or not? The 250,000 for 10 Equity coming from you Mr Wonderful. I expected to hear the words you have cash cash flow. Would it be okay if we just heard that if any of the other sharks are interested? I would definitely I'll give you 300. Thank you! I love this! I'm gonna make you an offer, I'm going to go 300,000 for 10 percent. I understand all of this, I mean I've been in this market so much and I know how to get all the things you talked about from the licensing to the retail stores. I think you should be everywhere and fast because you are something that could really take off. That's our mission, we want to spread the joy and confidence of learning something new. I'm going to give you 350,000 for 10. Three hundred thousand for eight percent. Okay this mentoring is going to be worth it guys you understand all the offers right? You got to make a decision. Hold it a second, just hold it a second. I'm going to give you the 350 for five percent, that's how much I believe in your business. You are sitting on a rocket but you have to let me know right away because I'm being a fool here bidding against myself which would do is Mark come on countered for eight. I can do this all alone. We've read your book and we know we've seen what you've been able to do. I think that if you would team up with another shark what was the amount you gave us? 350 the 350 for six percent. Robert are you going to do anything here trying to get a word in here? I mean it's hard, I'm just saying how can I get a piece of this? Make an offer. Yeah I'd love to be involved so we're going to give you 450 for six percent two of us together. Guys you understand all the offers right? You got to make a decision if we take a moment yes we can you can thank you. Okay so each shark offers a lot of different value in different areas and where we think in the short term that we can really get the most help is with Mark and Lori. I want to let you know that like you mean so much to me but for the company I think you're going to abandon me like that that's what they want to do. 450 thousand six percent you guys got a deal! Oh I've had it now! Oh my God sharks we did not prepare for that when it worked out it was definitely a risky move to Barbara and Mark and get Lori in there instead and we're glad that it worked out.\"\n",

            "Product='Foam Party Hats' Full_Pitch=\"Hi Sharks, my name is Manuel Rojas and a young race Ross and we're here asking for a hundred thousand dollars for fifteen percent of our amazing company. This amazing idea started more than 15 years ago back in Venezuela at my sister's wedding. My beautiful genius creative mother decided to make something fun, something different. I want to create something special for my guests, so I bought some materials and started making my first foam party hats. Fast forward to 2017, we found a foam party hat here in the US. We have more than 600 models, all of them handmade in the US and they're 100% customizable. Sharks, who's ready to get crazy with foam? We're a party company! I want to celebrate that this is the first time I wear pants in a long time! So if you look behind your seat, you'll find a box with your own custom foam party hat. Okay, so let's start. Ladies first, Laurie, the QVC queen! It's a jewelry box! Yeah, exactly! So we know you made your first millions of boxes, put it on! Mark, can you guess that? Yes! Damn, collecting when I was a kid! Yes! Oh my gosh, everybody knows it! Mr. Wonderful! Yeah, listen, that's spectacular, but not everybody knows you're Chef Wonderful, right? And your favorite place? They do, Robert! So I truly believe you're the best-dressed shark all the time, that's why we made this Croatian cute suit hat tailored just for you! We heard that you're crazy about nuts! Daniel, I love nothing for you! True nuts can change the world! Yeah, I know, right? So guys, please take the hat, reach out inside, and you'll find a little switch! So there you go, it gets even better! That is tremendous! Okay, you guys are ready? I have a question, do you design all of these and make all of them? So she designs everything! You know, we mentioned that we have 600 hats, it's because a lot of the products that we have created because people reach out to us and ask for custom hats. So when I go online to find foam party hats, am I going to find you at the top of that list? Of course! And that's what drives sales! Just that keyword has been what brings all the business to us! They always get big orders, average sale is 240 or so. How much is a hat? So this one is 25, this one is 40. How much is this expensive? That one is 35. Laurie's is 50. How much does it cost you to make a 45 hat? Cost of product will be around two, three dollars and seven dollars will be the employees. It's cool that you're able to customize, but most times you want to have one or two or ten items that you can crank out and just sell a huge amount! Let me finish explaining the business model! So people, you know, weddings is our biggest market, like eighty percent of our sales weddings! Yeah, the wedding industry that I have many companies in that business has grown to a halt since March 17th! Is anybody getting married here? So yeah, so we have changed our business model while the pandemic hits! Basically, our sales decreased like 80! One week I was sleeping two, three hours because I was freaking out! But one day I woke up and I was like, I hate when people just stay without doing nothing and crying about like, oh my god, we're not going to be able to make it! Especially, you know, people dying and we had no excuse to just do nothing! So I went to Amazon, started investigating how to be really proficient on Amazon! So first month in March, we did like 800 dollars worth! But then I spent many hours at night figuring out how to do keyword SEO, electronics, career sales on Amazon! Last month, last month, 6,000! Good for you! When the wedding business was big, what were your sales on a monthly? Okay, so let me just tell the overall sales! So when we started in 2017, we did 25,000 in sales! 2018, we got 75,000 dollars in sales! And then last year we did 145,000 in sales! This year right now, we have sold eight thousand dollars more than last year, which for me I think is amazing! It's great based on that on the pandemic, right? Is anything automated or automatable? Not right now, but that's why we're here! We need the money to scale up big, big time! What did you do to get people to you? Nothing! Nothing! What did you do during the pandemic? Oh, the pandemic! So I have a... let me show you something real! I was waiting for this! Give it one second! So one thing, while the pandemic hits is that everything was about a great idea, social differences! So I told my mom, let's just make something that is like a virus, but let's make it fun so people don't get offended by it! How many of those have you sold? We have sold around 300 of these! Look, companies that service parties and weddings get 80% of their sales from 20% of their product line! That's the business model that works! But you don't have that model yet! It's a great business for you! It's a family business! You guys are terrific! I feel bad about saying I'm out, but I know before you say anything, I just did! Guys, let me step in! Your biggest challenge here is you don't know what business you're in! You think you're in the foam hat business and you're trying to figure out how to sell more foam hats! You're in the fun business! Correct! Right! You figured out how to sell fun when you did your virus hats! You just want to keep on creating ideas and using SEO because you can control your own destiny! But you don't know what business you're in yet! So for those reasons, I'm out! Manuel, I might be giving you an offer based on how you answer the following questions! Do you own 100% of the business? 80 and 20! 80 for guys! Is this your full-time job? No, I have a full-time job! I'm a chemical engineer! And are you willing to make this your full-time job? Of course! That's why we're here! Are you sure? Because the only way I'll give you an offer is if you're fully... Yes, of course! Like, I don't know about that, but you're not investing! So yeah, but I'm just trying to help! I'm trying to help my friend! Manuel, let me just tell you where I'm at! Sorry, Daniel, just to clear things up! There's two things I really admire about you guys! One is the hustle and the other one is your ability to just make no excuses! It's a great business for you, but as an investment, it's not for me! So I'm out! Thank you, Robert! Appreciate it! Listen, I love you guys! I love your energy! There's just a ton of work to be done! Like, I calculate I'm going to be putting another 200,000 in my team members' time to just help you guys along! I don't think you have figured out how to mass scale at kind! We master Amazon! We need to deploy your creativity and together I think with some guidance, I think we will build a huge business! The offer is a hundred thousand dollars for 30 percent and it is not negotiable because it's going to be on top of the hundred thousand dollars a ridiculous amount of work! Not a bad offer! Don't quit your job! Huge mistake! Manuel, I love when these sharks have all these comments but they will back out! Let me just tell you all the things he wants to do are gonna cost more than a hundred thousand dollars! Mark Cuban forbids you getting any money here! You ask for more money! Listen, what I think you're missing is marketing expertise, right? I want Daniel to have me join him as a partner! I'm really good at marketing and I'm really working with you later! But this deal is just going to take so much focus and attention! I will help you guys figure it out, but I think I need to go on this! We're going alone! Yes, he just threw you under a bus! Mark, you want to go in with me just to mess with Daniel? Go in with me! Why don't we do a hundred thousand dollars for 25? Let's do this! So the way to do this, meanwhile Grace, is you do what you did with the virus hat! That's where your creativity comes shining through! And you combine that with not just your SEO abilities but our SEO abilities, right? Then you can keep your job! What are you talking about? You need him to figure this stuff out unless you're going to work! No, because he wants to do this! Grace, Emmanuel, you have two offers! You got to get focused now! You've got Mark who came back in after barking at you like a dog all day! And then you've got Daniel who wants to put you full-time! Mark and Lori's offer does not require you to quit your job! Manuel, this is the key question! What do you want to do with your life? We love you, Daniel! Honestly, what you're doing is amazing! But having two sharks for 25% experience... Wait a second! I will do it! I want to say at this point, I would like... we're still facing up and then I need a stability just in case something happens! Gloria, my vision! Sorry, I'm sorry! I really appreciate it, but this is a really good offer for us! Mark and Lori, thank you so much! Guys, we're gonna crush! Man, oh my god! Now we'll do our money dance! Yeah, we need a shark! Thank you, guys! Get ready, guys! Get ready! Come on!\"\n",

            "Product='Happy Floss' Full_Pitch=\"Hi Sharks, my name is Dr Stacy Whitman, I'm a board certified pediatric dentist from Portland Oregon and I'm here today seeking two hundred thousand dollars for 10 Equity of my company. No sharks, with millions of people seeing your beautiful smiles every week, I'm sure you've lost it daily and you should because cavities and gum disease are two of the most chronic diseases globally. Well, are you ready for me to drop some more truth bombs? [Music] Oh my God [Music] starts this is only 3,000 flossers repurposed from my dental office. If you use single-use plastic every day to floss your teeth, you will create nearly thirty thousand pieces of trash in your lifetime. That's 10 times this amount. Now plastic classrooms will take nearly 400 years or more to break down if they ever do, potentially releasing Plastics microtoxins and microplastics into our soil, oceans, and eventually our bodies. Sharks, say goodbye to petroleum-based Plastics and say hello to Happy Floss! Happy Floss is the world's first flosser designed for true compostability. It's made of layers of post-consumer recycled paper, making it biodegradable, breaking down in under one year. No toxins, no microplastics, just clean soil. It's good for you and it's good for our planet. So who's with me, sharks? Who wants to help me create happier teeth and a healthier planet together? In front of you are your own flossers to check out and get to flossing.\"\n",

            "Product=\"Nature's Wild Berry\" Full_Pitch=\"Hi Sharks, I'm Juliano and I'm Hank, we're from Santa Monica California and we're looking for 80,000 in exchange for 15 of our business. Hank, what do you do when you're eating a straight up lemon right now? Yeah dude, candy! Hold on, what kind of a berry makes a lemon taste like candy? Nature's wild berry! Just chew this Berry and it'll turn anything sour, tart, even fermented sweeter than sugar. That sounds like a magic wizard Berry to me! Pop one of these bad boys open and give it a try for 30 seconds. Okay, but you gotta explain to me how does this work? Miracle Berries contain a glycoprotein which right now are binding to The Taste receptors in your mouth blocking anything sour and instead making it sweet. Anything? What about that pickle right there? Make that sweet, try it! Now try some of this Ultra tart cranberry juice. Hmm, it tastes like candy! I told you! Let's see if you could throw back this shot of apple cider vinegar. Okay, it tastes like apple juice! Wow! Magic with this Berry, you can transform your taste buds unlocking hidden flavors from food and drinks you never thought were possible. So how about it sharks, who wants to get wild with Nature's Wildberry? Try the magic out yourselves! So what you want to do first is you got a whole bunch of stuff there, try the food that's on your plate beforehand. I just kind of want you to get a before and after type. Exactly! Wow! Oh my God! [Music] Horrible! That's unsweetened cranberry! You won't want to forget the green juice so make sure you try that. I've tried everything! What do I do with them now? We're going to take two berries, two berries and you're gonna chew those. It's gonna be like a fruit infused popcorn flavor. The berry 30 seconds, make sure it moves all over here at the same time. Yeah, this just turned into a sweet pickle! That's crazy! The lemon tastes like an orange! That's really incredible! This is insanity! Oh, it does taste like an orange, right? How long does it last? It lasts about 20 to 40 minutes! I feel like a miracle is happening right now! It tastes like an orange! You're right! But a polar trick though, is this some kind of tree? By the minute and it starts to get sweeter? Yes, as you have it! So what's the purpose? But like what are you thinking to do with this as a product? So this transformed my life! I used to be 250 pounds, size 40 plus weights and facing diabetes! That's right! And oh, there you go, that's a picture of me! You look a lot better now! Thank you! Well, I realized that people were using this Berry a lot for novelty but my best friend here had a restaurant and he was using me as a guinea pig at the time because he wanted to test these berries out but I needed real help! I had kind of lost hope! I was just gaining weight and what was it? You were just attracted to Sweet Food! Actually, I identify as an emotional eater! I started eating for anything, drinking for anything and really the thing that most people don't understand as emotional eaters is that discipline and willpower have absolutely nothing to do! Gosh, sometimes all you can think about is taste! Lucky for me, he specialized in taste and he made the healthiest green juice I'd ever seen! In fact, you got that you craved that sweet taste, right? But right! So now you could eat things that were healthy for you but they tasted sweet so you like that clean! I have two, I have three things here in front of me! Those are our usual best sellers! That's called our travel jar because you can take it and put it in your pocket and travel with it! So how much is this? That is 24.99! Wow, for just this thing? So when, yes, for just that's not so sweet! Before you say that, when we came into the market, so I looked online, I found it and it said five berries for fifty dollars! How much does it cost you right now? Okay, so right now that cost us about two dollars and 64 cents! So let's talk about sales! What are you going to sell this year? We are projected to do about 340,000! And how are you selling that 340,000? So right now we are on the largest online retail and people know what it is! That is probably the biggest difficult things, it just sounds wacky! Exactly! 50k! And who else is selling this? It's a commodity! So when I go online to look for people who are selling these berries, it's still pretty rare actually! So why are they rare? It's extremely difficult to grow! So are you growing them or you have a self-supply? So we looked all over the world for a supplier for the berry and then the one that ultimately was the best supplier was somebody in America! And do you have a lot of money in the business? He initially dropped 120,000 so he went all in! Either as much as I could in there, in total I probably threw about 20 grand in there! Okay guys, I'm gonna take a flyer on you because it's such a crazy thing! You guys own the business 50/50? Yes! Okay, I want to be a third partner! So I'm going to give you the 80,000 for 33 percent! Okay, I want five dollars a unit until I get back 160,000 so I double my money because I'm Banker here but it's not a royal team perpetuity! Okay, but for me it's a flyer! It kind of fits into what I do as a chef! Thank you so much! I just want to help you guys if you really are passionate about having somebody take the journey! I'm I believe I'm the one situated for now with my new found faith in Fitness! 80,000 for 30, no royalty like the blood sucking Kevin over here to take that Journey with you! What do you say? Let me change my offer just to make it competitive! Okay! [Music] Offers on the table for Nature's wild berry, their supplement that makes tart Foods taste sweet! Let me change my offer just to make it competitive! Okay, eighty thousand dollars for twenty percent equity to slightly higher than what you want but I'm leaving my royalty in place so you guys still are in control! Anyways! [Music] As well, we'll offer you eighty thousand dollars for twenty percent but I would like three dollars per unit until I get my money back! I don't, I'm just willing to take the ride because it's so interesting! Thank you guys! The question I'm trying to answer is what's the accelerant because you have your personal experience and it's been great! People are always trying to lose weight but you can't make that claim! So who is the target audience? If you're struggling with sweets, that's the most obvious and in that group is a lot of people! We've had birthday parties, we have parents who want their kids to eat something! Trying to figure out how you sell millions of dollars worth, right? Look, I think it's great! This has got it all the time, all the time! And you've got little jars, you know, on tables, whatever! I just don't know what that path is! Well here, I gave an offer! I offered you eighty thousand dollars twenty percent, three dollars per unit! And so I would like to know whether or not you like my offer because you have two other offers! We've been sitting here a while! Let me clear the deck on this side! I think it's just too wacky for me although I'm very impressed by you and the product! I'm out! Thank you! By the way! Alright guys, you guys listen, can we take literally four seconds? You know because you have two other people here! I would rather go in with another shark because honestly, you know if one of you guys wants to party 20, 20 for two sharks! Absolutely! Two sharks, three dollars per! I mean I do it with Mark if he wants to do it! Deal's too much! Big mistake! Why would you do that? Listen, I'll tell you what for all of you though, if you want to contact us, you get free berries anytime you want! Just let us know! Hahaha! You mean it? Oh my gosh! For everyone that said we should go on Shark Tank, they were right! I guess they're all right! Okay, we got the same two sharks that we always wanted! Thinking about this validation from Mark and Lori, it makes me emotional because it's been six years and it's been a very long journey to get here and we've traveled through so many obstacles but now we're here and we've got the deal and it's all worth it!\"\n",

Growing up, my family shared with me the richness of my African Heritage, including African beauty secrets growing from the shea tree in Africa. This nut produces what we all know as shea butter, and boy did I love this moisturizer. So it's no reason my aunt in Nigeria persuaded people traveling from her village to pack tubs of pure shea butter to my family in Texas. And when I say tubs, I mean this beauty right here wrapped in cellophane, fancy right? For Sharks, this thing is magic! Inspired by my own heritage, I took this little gem and turned it into 54 Thrones, standing for the 54 countries in Africa. We partner directly with African cooperatives to create our line of clean beauty products while promoting trade, not aid. Our products are decadent and divine, from our Glow Body Oil to our Moroccan Body Mask and our award-winning African Beauty Butters. 54 Thrones is here to celebrate the beauty, the luxury, the romance the motherland has to offer.
