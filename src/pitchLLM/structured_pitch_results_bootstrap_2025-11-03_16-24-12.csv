As a farmer myself, I've seen firsthand the devastating impact of food waste on our business and our legacy. Every year, billions of pounds of produce are wasted due to cosmetic imperfections, and it's not just a financial loss - it's a loss for our families and our communities. Katie Joe Evans's family, for example, has been farming for generations, and they're passionate about reducing food waste to ensure the success of their business and the legacy of their family.

That's why we created The Frozen Farmer, a line of super-premium frozen desserts made from misfit fruits and vegetables from our own fields. Our products are not only delicious, but they're also nutritious and profitable. We offer a range of options, including ice cream, dairy-free sorbet, gluten-free sorbet, fat-free sorbet, and nice cream - a part sorbet, part ice cream blend that's a game-changer. Our desserts are the richest, creamiest, and most epic explosion of flavor you'll ever taste, and they're all made with farm-fresh flavor.

By using cosmetically imperfect produce, we're reducing food waste and creating a new revenue stream for farmers like Katie Joe Evans's family. Our mission is to reduce food waste by transforming imperfect produce into delicious and profitable frozen desserts. And we're not just talking about a small impact - we're talking about a movement. So, Sharks, who wants a scoop of this cool business where we turn imperfect produce into profits? We're looking for a $125,000 investment in exchange for 20% equity. Join us in our mission to reduce food waste and create a sweeter future for farmers and families everywhere.""",bootstrap,groq/llama-3.3-70b-versatile,groq/openai/gpt-oss-120b,2025-11-03_16-24-12,0.92,0.95,0.9,0.9,"The pitch includes virtually all required facts (founder, company name, ask, problem, solution, key differentiators, benefits, and closing call‑to‑action).

f306cd1a-6c89-4bae-81ae-894bcd2cdc38,Kronos Golf,"Hi Sharks, my name is Eric Williams, creative director at Chronos Golf and I'm Philip Lapooz, founder and designer at Chronos Golf. We're seeking 150,000 for a 15% stake in our company. We're an indie putter company that manufactures the most precise putters in the world. You might have heard the phrase drive for show and putt for dough; putting accounts for half the shots of an average golfer, so why are we blowing our money on drivers and shoddy putters? That is where Chronos comes in. We mill our putters down to one one-thousandth of an inch to make sure our putters are perfectly balanced. We start off with a solid block of steel and mill it for over two hours, transforming it from stage one, a solid block of steel, to stage two, a roughly milled putter, to stage three, a more refined build putter. It's a slow, labor-intensive process, but it's the right way to make a well-balanced putter. From there, each one is individually hand worked, including delicate deburring, polishing, and painting, all the while preserving that critical balance. The truth is, there's no putter out there that'll make you better overnight, but ours will help you put more consistently, and that might be the only difference between winning and losing. Plus, they're super sexy, so let's get the devil on the dance floor and give these putters a try.","""Good evening Sharks, I'm Founder 1 and this is Founder 2, co-founders of Kronos Golf. We're here today to ask for a $150,000 investment in exchange for 15% equity in our company. As golf enthusiasts, we know that the average golfer spends a lot of time and money on their drivers, but often neglects the most important club in their bag: the putter. Despite accounting for nearly half of all shots taken, putters are often an afterthought. And that's because traditional putters can be inconsistent and imbalanced, leading to frustrating putting performance.

But what if we told you there's a way to take your putting game to the next level? Introducing the Chronos Putter, a game-changing golf putter that's precision-milled to one one-thousandth of an inch. Our putter is made from a solid block of steel, hand-worked to perfection, and features a perfectly balanced design that will give you the consistency you need to win. With the Chronos Putter, you'll experience improved performance, increased confidence, and a sexy design that will make you the envy of your fellow golfers.

At Kronos Golf, our mission is to manufacture the most precise putters in the world, and we believe that with the right investment, we can make that happen. We're not just looking for investors, we're looking for partners who share our passion for golf and our commitment to excellence. So, Sharks, we invite you to give our putters a try and see the difference for yourself. Join us in our quest to revolutionize the world of golf, one putter at a time.""",bootstrap,groq/llama-3.3-70b-versatile,groq/openai/gpt-oss-120b,2025-11-03_16-24-12,0.83,0.75,0.9,0.85,"The pitch includes most required facts but misses some specific keywords (e.g., 'shoddy putters', 'deburring', 'polishing', 'painting'), leading to a moderate factual score.
