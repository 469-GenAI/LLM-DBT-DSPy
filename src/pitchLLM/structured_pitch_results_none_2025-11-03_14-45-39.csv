f306cd1a-6c89-4bae-81ae-894bcd2cdc38,Kronos Golf,"Hi Sharks, my name is Eric Williams, creative director at Chronos Golf and I'm Philip Lapooz, founder and designer at Chronos Golf. We're seeking 150,000 for a 15% stake in our company. We're an indie putter company that manufactures the most precise putters in the world. You might have heard the phrase drive for show and putt for dough; putting accounts for half the shots of an average golfer, so why are we blowing our money on drivers and shoddy putters? That is where Chronos comes in. We mill our putters down to one one-thousandth of an inch to make sure our putters are perfectly balanced. We start off with a solid block of steel and mill it for over two hours, transforming it from stage one, a solid block of steel, to stage two, a roughly milled putter, to stage three, a more refined build putter. It's a slow, labor-intensive process, but it's the right way to make a well-balanced putter. From there, each one is individually hand worked, including delicate deburring, polishing, and painting, all the while preserving that critical balance. The truth is, there's no putter out there that'll make you better overnight, but ours will help you put more consistently, and that might be the only difference between winning and losing. Plus, they're super sexy, so let's get the devil on the dance floor and give these putters a try.",,none,<dspy.clients.lm.LM object at 0x102a572b0>,<dspy.clients.lm.LM object at 0x14c836200>,2025-11-03_14-45-39,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,Error: litellm.InternalServerError: InternalServerError: GroqException - Object of type LM is not JSON serializable
