We're asking for a $125,000 investment in exchange for 20% equity in our company. As a farmer, I've seen firsthand the devastating impact of food waste on our industry. My friend Katie Joe Evans's family has been farming for generations, and they've always struggled with the fact that billions of pounds of produce are wasted each year due to cosmetic imperfections. This not only hurts their business but also threatens the legacy of their family's farm. That's why we created The Frozen Farmer, a line of super premium frozen desserts made from the misfit fruits and vegetables from our own fields. Our products are not only delicious and nutritious, but they're also dairy-free, gluten-free, and fat-free, making them accessible to a wide range of customers. By converting cosmetically imperfect produce into profitable frozen desserts, we're reducing food waste and creating a new revenue stream for farmers like Katie Joe's family. Our mission is to reduce food waste by transforming imperfect produce into delicious and profitable frozen desserts. So, who wants a scoop of this cool business where we turn imperfect produce into profits?""",none,groq/llama-3.3-70b-versatile,groq/openai/gpt-oss-120b,2025-11-03_15-11-01,0.84,0.85,0.8,0.9,"The pitch includes founder, company, offer, problem description, solution name, differentiator, benefits, mission, and call to action, matching most facts. It omits several detailed feature keywords and the full product category list, lowering factual score slightly. Narrative clearly presents problem, solution, and mission but lacks a deeper personal founder story, resulting in a solid but not perfect narrative score. The tone is confident and persuasive, earning a high style score."

f306cd1a-6c89-4bae-81ae-894bcd2cdc38,Kronos Golf,"Hi Sharks, my name is Eric Williams, creative director at Chronos Golf and I'm Philip Lapooz, founder and designer at Chronos Golf. We're seeking 150,000 for a 15% stake in our company. We're an indie putter company that manufactures the most precise putters in the world. You might have heard the phrase drive for show and putt for dough; putting accounts for half the shots of an average golfer, so why are we blowing our money on drivers and shoddy putters? That is where Chronos comes in. We mill our putters down to one one-thousandth of an inch to make sure our putters are perfectly balanced. We start off with a solid block of steel and mill it for over two hours, transforming it from stage one, a solid block of steel, to stage two, a roughly milled putter, to stage three, a more refined build putter. It's a slow, labor-intensive process, but it's the right way to make a well-balanced putter. From there, each one is individually hand worked, including delicate deburring, polishing, and painting, all the while preserving that critical balance. The truth is, there's no putter out there that'll make you better overnight, but ours will help you put more consistently, and that might be the only difference between winning and losing. Plus, they're super sexy, so let's get the devil on the dance floor and give these putters a try.","""Good evening Sharks, I'm Founder 1 and this is Founder 2, co-founders of Kronos Golf. We're here today to ask for a $150,000 investment in exchange for 15% equity in our company. As avid golfers ourselves, we know how frustrating it can be to struggle with inconsistent putting performance. But what if we told you that the problem isn't you, it's your putter? The average golfer prioritizes their driver over their putter, despite the fact that putting accounts for nearly half of their shots. This is because most putters on the market are imbalanced, leading to inconsistent performance.

We've spoken to countless golfers who've shared their stories of frustration and disappointment on the green. They've tried everything from adjusting their stance to changing their grip, but nothing seems to work. That's because the root of the problem lies in the putter itself. At Kronos Golf, we've set out to change this with our revolutionary new product, the Chronos Putter. Made from a solid block of steel, our putter is precision milled to one one-thousandth of an inch, ensuring perfect balance and consistency.

But what really sets us apart is our attention to detail. Each putter is hand worked, deburred, polished, and painted to create a truly unique and sexy design. The result is a putter that not only performs exceptionally well but also looks amazing. With the Chronos Putter, golfers can say goodbye to inconsistent putting and hello to improved performance and winning. Our mission at Kronos Golf is to manufacture the most precise putters in the world, and we invite you to join us on this journey. So, Sharks, are you ready to give our putters a try and take your game to the next level?""",none,groq/llama-3.3-70b-versatile,groq/openai/gpt-oss-120b,2025-11-03_15-11-01,0.92,0.9,0.95,0.9,"All key facts are present except the exact 'blowing money on drivers and shoddy putters' phrase, leading to a slight factual deduction.
