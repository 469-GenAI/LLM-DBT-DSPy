f306cd1a-6c89-4bae-81ae-894bcd2cdc38,Kronos Golf,"Hi Sharks, my name is Eric Williams, creative director at Chronos Golf and I'm Philip Lapooz, founder and designer at Chronos Golf. We're seeking 150,000 for a 15% stake in our company. We're an indie putter company that manufactures the most precise putters in the world. You might have heard the phrase drive for show and putt for dough; putting accounts for half the shots of an average golfer, so why are we blowing our money on drivers and shoddy putters? That is where Chronos comes in. We mill our putters down to one one-thousandth of an inch to make sure our putters are perfectly balanced. We start off with a solid block of steel and mill it for over two hours, transforming it from stage one, a solid block of steel, to stage two, a roughly milled putter, to stage three, a more refined build putter. It's a slow, labor-intensive process, but it's the right way to make a well-balanced putter. From there, each one is individually hand worked, including delicate deburring, polishing, and painting, all the while preserving that critical balance. The truth is, there's no putter out there that'll make you better overnight, but ours will help you put more consistently, and that might be the only difference between winning and losing. Plus, they're super sexy, so let's get the devil on the dance floor and give these putters a try.","""Good evening Sharks, I'm Founder 1 and this is Founder 2, co-founders of Kronos Golf. We're here today to present our innovative golf putter, the Chronos Putter, and we're seeking an investment of $150,000 in exchange for 15% equity. As golfers ourselves, we know how frustrating it can be to struggle with inconsistent putting performance. But what we've realized is that the problem often lies not with the golfer, but with the putter itself. Traditional putters can be imbalanced, leading to inconsistent rolls and missed putts.

""We've found that golfers often prioritize their drivers over their putters, despite the fact that putting accounts for nearly half of their shots. But what if we told you that there's a way to improve your putting performance dramatically? Our Chronos Putter is precision-milled to one one-thousandth of an inch, ensuring that every putter is perfectly balanced and consistent. Made from a solid block of steel, our putters are hand-worked, deburred, polished, and painted to perfection.

""The result is a putter that is not only incredibly effective but also visually stunning. Our mission at Kronos Golf is to manufacture the most precise putters in the world, giving golfers the consistency and confidence they need to improve their game. We believe that our Chronos Putter can help golfers of all levels win more often and enjoy the game more. So, Sharks, we invite you to give our putters a try and experience the difference for yourself.
