As filters get dirty, they stop working, and what this doesn't catch, you and your loved ones are breathing in. This includes pollen, pet dander, mold, smoke, bacteria, and even CO2. And that's why I created Whoosh, a better air filter that's smart enough to know when it needs to be changed. Let me show you how it works. The smart air filter is made of two parts: a filter and a reusable frame. The filter is made from the highest quality materials and is placed inside the frame. The filter connects to Wi-Fi and has integrated sensors that track the performance of your filter, so when it's time to change, we send a notification and a filter replacement in the mail.

I'm David Co. Today we're here asking for $400k for 5% of our Dallas-based company Yugo Natural. Sharks, what do y'all do when you're having a bad hair day or those days you just don't feel like washing your hair? We can't all be 'no hair, don't care' like Mr. Wonderful over here. Some of us just can't put on a hat because our natural hair can get damaged. One go-to option is the head wrap, but traditional head wraps can be made from harsh fabrics like cotton or polyester that can damage the hair, and learning how to tie them can be time-consuming and confusing. That's why I created the first-ever satin-lined easy tie head wraps. Yugo Natural wraps are not only super stylish and super easy to use, they're designed to protect and promote the health of your hair with super soft satin lining that reduces friction and retains the moisture in your hair. Our core line features cool turbans from lots of styles for both women and men, so you can look good on the go no matter what kind of hair you have. And that's not all! Our latest invention, the swim turban, is made with silicone lining so anyone can enjoy the water without worrying about the harsh effects of salt water and chlorine on your hair. Today, we built a massive customer base directly online, but we're here to make Yugo Natural a household name. So, Sharks, which one of you is ready to wrap this deal up?", "generated_pitch": "\"Good evening Sharks, I'm Founder 1, and I'm here with my co-founder, Founder 2, to present our company, You Go Natural.
